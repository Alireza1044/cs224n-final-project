        "Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.",
        "What?",
        "I\u2019ll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I\u2019m always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.",

        "Sure thing, buddy.",

        "Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?",
        "Hmmm, well\u2026 let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don\u2019t know. Michael Scott.",

        "Bueno.",
        "In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here\u2019s the good news. Every success I\u2019ve ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.",
        "What\u2019s the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?",
        "Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.",
        "I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It\u2019s really a pleasure to be a part of it. It\u2019s like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?",
        "My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don\u2019t give up easily. I have walked two marathons.",
        "Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It\u2019s in the Hamptons. My dad\u2019s got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow\u2019s nest. Also shot a deer once.",
        "Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don\u2019t work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It\u2019s in New York.",
        "Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.",
        "I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.",
        "Ow.",
        "Oh man. Talk about your classic \u201cLame dash O.\u201d Do we even want that guy buying our paper?",
        "I\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry man. I really screwed that up.",
        "I really \u2018Schruted\u2019 it.",
        "\u2018Schruted\u2019 it. It\u2019s just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you \u2018Schruted\u2019 it. I don\u2019t know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?",
        "Hey boss. Got a minute?",
        "I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?",
        "That\u2019s weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That\u2019s not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?",
        "Oh, doggie.",
        "It sure seems like he is lying.",
        "Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp.",
        "Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy\u2019s such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I\u2019m thrilled. So, it\u2019s pretty\u2026  Hello? Pretty good.",
        "Big Turkey.",
        "All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.",
        "Thank you muchly.",
        "I called it myself. I just thought you\u2019d get a kick out of the new ring.",
        "Side note. I\u2019d just like to say I\u2019m thrilled to be working directly beneath you.",
        "I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you\u2019re younger and have less experience.  So here\u2019s to the future\u2026 Andy and the Tuna.  Andy and the tuna\u2026",

        "Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my \u201cLost\u201d on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?",
        "Well, I will take that as a maybe.  Where are you going?",
        "Oh, well, I\u2019m going to the kitchen, I\u2019ll walk with you.",
        "Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin\u2019 a lot of face time with the boss.",
        "Feel ya, dawg.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You said\u2026",

        "Oh, no.",

        "Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?",
        "Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football \u2013 Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we\u2019ll hit the tiz-own.",
        "Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.",
        "Fine. I\u2019ll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.  Excuse me. And I\u2019m also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it\u2019s funny to steal someone\u2019s personal property and hide it from them. Here\u2019s a little newsflash! It\u2019s not funny! In fact, it\u2019s pretty freakin\u2019 unfunny!  Oh, my GOD.  That\u2026 was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?",
        "Sure? Okay.",
        "So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material.  This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don\u2019t worry about old Andy Bernard. I\u2019ll be back. Just like Rambo, so.",
        "Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be\u2026 Marcy!",

        "Good morning, Pam.",

        "Whoa!  What\u2019s the situation?",
        "Ok, when\u2019s the shunning thing gonna end?",
        "When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.",

        "It\u2019s OK. I can\u2019t always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.",
        "Is it fresh?",
        "Umm\u2026  No.",
        "People don\u2019t need to be afraid of me. I can\u2019t achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn\u2019t care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d. Nearly twice.",
        "You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and\u2026 acting on that thing.",
        "Yes bosses.",

        "Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don\u2019t have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don\u2019t jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.",

        "She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She\u2019s a real Renaissance woman.",
        "Chicken pot pie.",
        "That\u2019s what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.",
        "She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she\u2019s going to.",
        "I threw in some scratch tickets, \u2019cause generous guy, and next thing you know we\u2019re making out in the woods.",
        "No, we were really making out in the woods.",
        "I gotta go talk to her.",
        "Yeah. I\u2019m Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I\u2019d like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis: broken.",
        "Who\u2019s this guy?",
        "You\u2019re such a liar.",
        "Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.",
        "Dude, there she is. Don\u2019t look, don\u2019t look. She\u2019s sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.",
        "What is your problem, man? Can\u2019t you support a bro? That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have any friends, Tuna. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I just, I need\u2026",
        "\u2026your help. I love her.",
        "Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?",
        "Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She\u2019s really into White Russians and whippets.",
        "Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "What?",
        "What happened? What can I do to help?",
        "I\u2019ll check the web.",

        "Aye, aye, Cap\u2019n.",
        "Think we\u2019ll find him?",
        "Halvsies?",
        "Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.",
        "Yep. If you don\u2019t mind, I think I\u2019ll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.",
        "Hey good lookin\u2019, what ya got cookin\u2019?",
        "Hey listen, I\u2019m sure everyone\u2019s already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.",
        "Borscht, according to Dwight it\u2019s best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I\u2019m doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight\u2019s trust.",
        "I should make you my vichyssoise.",
        "Let me be clear.  There\u2019s only one thing that\u2019s important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.",
        "You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don\u2019t know.  I don\u2019t have to know.  That\u2019s what makes me so dangerous.",
        "We will be team U.S.A.",
        "Phyllis is out. Yes!  Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good.",
        "Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re not\u2026",
        "No where near the big rock.",
        "What\u2019re you doing? No! See, now we\u2019re disqualified.",
        "I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard!",
        "Great job everyone, that was fantastic.",
        "I am so hungry!",
        "One came up.",
        "I didn\u2019t win. But the only reason I didn\u2019t win is because I recently learned that it\u2019s better to work thing out with words.",
        "Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.",
        "Yeah, right, c\u2019mon! C\u2019mon!",
        "Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!",
        "Go tell them I\u2019m floating away, obviously!",
        "Angela, it\u2019s pretty simple! Look at what I\u2019m doing and go tell somebody about it!",
        "Angela!",
        "Hello?  Who\u2019s there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?",
        "Nice!",
        "It is an honor just to be considered for Michael\u2019s job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.",
        "Keep eating tuna, Big Tuna. Loser!",
        "Wait!",
        "Blup-dup-do. What\u2019s up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.",
        "What is it, Big Haircut?",
        "Sorry, I can\u2019t hear you Big Haircut.",
        "What?",
        "I will see you at the inter-view.",
        "Saving the best for first!",
        "White, because it contains all other colors.",
        "You make a chair, but you don\u2019t sit on it.",
        "The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.",
        "Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.",
        "I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn\u2019t you say?",
        "I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.",
        "Damn it!",
        "Hail to the chief!",
        "My first order of business: accept.",
        "Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad.",

        "I\u2019m punishing them.",

        "It is the source of all energy on this planet.",
        "I\u2019m a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is\u2026 my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent\u2026  and quick on my feet.",
        "Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.",

        "I\u2019m petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So\u2026 I take precautions.",

        "So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she\u2019s giving off fairly strong vibes that she\u2019s not interested.",

        "No.  I will not be playing it \u201ccool\u201d  with Angela.  Let me tell you a little story.  When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school.  Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted.  Did I wait, on that list?  No, I did not.  I busted into the admissions office and I  sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school .  And guess what?  I.  Got.  In.  And here\u2019s the kicker.  That school?  Cornell.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I left a little present for Angela.  I think she\u2019s going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.",

Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It\u2019s just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It\u2019s hot, I\u2019m not going to lie to you , but it\u2019s a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?",

We\u2019re makin\u2019 out, I\u2019m kissin\u2019 her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she\u2019s not really kissing me back.

        "No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I\u2019m at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent,  I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it\u2026 felt like.",
        "Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he\u2019s like really aggressive?",
        "It\u2019s not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it\u2019s like, not a fantasy, it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s just a scenario.",
        "Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?",
        "Women friends?",
        "Not guy friends?",
        "No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.",
        "But off the record, I\u2019m kinda confused.",
        "Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like\u2026",
        "Yeah, right?",
        "How?",
        "Right-o.",
        "Ohh\u2026",
        "Alright.  Well hey\u2026",
        "Congratulations to you.",
        "Come on\u2026 little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.",
        "I heard it from Erin.",
        "Even the fact that I\u2019m gay?",
        "Yes!",
        "Michael\u2026 am I gay?",
        "What can I do for ya Hoss?",
        "How are my sales doin\u2019?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it\u2019s \u2019cause of the economy.  You\u2019re not buying it, you\u2019re good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I\u2019m in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it\u2019s a total mind effer.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   \u201cHey Andy let\u2019s go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.\u201d",
        "You got it.",
        "Oh, just backing up and turning around.",
        "Dit, dit, dit, dit, it\u2019s not for you.   Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.",
        "Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you\u2019ll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, it\u2019s a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit.",
        "That\u2019s not how that goes.",
        "There\u2019s no way that Stanley gets more beans than me.  That is ridiculous. This is how it works.",
        "Thank you! That is exactly\u2013 by the way, I would also like a raise.",
        "Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And\u2026 frankly so does talking about it. So\u2026 wow\u2026",
        "What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara.",
        "No\u2026 I didn\u2019t steal your joke.",
        "Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It\u2019s like a five hour drive-ish, you know.",
        "Mmm-hmm. Erin?",
        "Not only is Erin really sweet and cute\u2026 she smell\u2019s like my mom.",
        "Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I\u2019ll break in the bed.",
        "How did Meredith get put at the young people\u2019s table?",
        "What? You\u2019re kid\u2013 That\u2019s\u2013 You\u2019re\u2013",
        "Partay. Room 639.",
        "Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.",
        "Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. \u2018Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!",
        "No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.",
        "If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don\u2019t tell anyone that I said that, \u2019cause I want them to come.",
        "You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.",
        "How about a little bit of this.",
        "Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo!",
        "I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.",
        "I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.",
        "Everyone else is too drunk.  Just don\u2019t let me die here.",
        "Are you sure this is the right way?",
        "Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on\u2026 my scrotum.",
        "I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so\u2013",
        "Well it\u2019s also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so\u2013",
        "Ow, ow!",
        "I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.",
        "No.  No that was real.",
        "Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um\u2013I just have that side to me.",
        "Well that\u2019s not\u2013",
        "I wasn\u2019t telling you.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "No, it didn\u2019t\u2013nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?",
        "It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.",
        "Golf.",
        "Stock market.",
        "Dave Matthews.",
        "What do you think?",
        "What happened in there?",
        "Mobsters are!",
        "He drives an SUV!",
        "All mobsters have a front, sometimes it\u2019s selling insurance, sometimes it\u2019s waste management or sanitation.",
        "Yeah, buy my insurance or I\u2019ll burn your warehouse down!",
        "It\u2019s John Gotti, you idiot!",
        "Yeah. It\u2019s pretty close.",
        "Already? This, this guy is persistent!",
        "Yeah right! You heard him! He\u2019s gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.",
        "That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!",
        "Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!",
        "That\u2019s how it works!",
        "When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back",
        "Dwight\u2026",
        "Wait let\u2019s hear him out, this is interesting.",
        "Okay.",
        "I like this plan. I\u2019d like to officially withdraw my plan.",
        "No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.",
        "Well you\u2019re gonna have to.  Dwight: We\u2019ll be right beside you.",
        "What?",
        "Well if I\u2019m gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I\u2019m a mechanic with a tire thing.",
        "To change tires, no. But it\u2019s metal, I can hit somebody with it.",
        "Should I change?",
        "Well then I can\u2019t use it. I\u2019m just gonna hide it.",
        "Oh! God!",
        "Hi.",
        "Hmm. Very true.",
        "You know, gabba-gool.",
        "Maybe we have a plan for you?",
        "Yeeeeah.",
        "Yes I can.",
        "Okay!",
        "Black goes on the red. With the\u2026 If we\u2026 Positive\u2026 Mo- it being a motor drive, it\u2019s probably down.",
        "You want to do this junior? I didn\u2019t think so. Sorry. It\u2019s kind of a long day at the\u2026 mechanic store.  Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.",
        "So your car\u2019s totaled. Uh, you\u2019re just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He\u2019s great. But uh, I can\u2019t do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles.",
        "Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn\u2019t give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.",
        "It was before, my tech- my technical training.",
        "Do it.",
        "Just do it.",
        "You were man enough to back down Michael, I\u2019m proud of you.",
        "He\u2019s alive.  So you\u2019re welcome.",
        "Yeah, some of that existed before.",
        "You\u2019re right, that is new.",
        "Well I don\u2019t see that happening.",
        "Are you saying-",
        "That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael\u2019s brain?",
        "That seems a little far-fetched.",
        "No, Michael. What we\u2019re trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who\u2019s a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.",
        "Class act. Boy scout.",
        "He\u2019s trying to intimidate you to close sales. He\u2019s just a pushy salesman.",
        "Whoa. Okay.",
        "Next time you look in the mirror, you\u2019re gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!",
        "You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!",
        "Sure thing, Tuna Boss.",
        "How may I be of service to you?",
        "This aurea is a joke.",
        "What are you thinking?",
        "Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.",
        "I know, right?",
        "Trust me it would only make you mad.",
        "Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?",
        "That is not okay dude.",
        "WB!",
        "Industrial P.! Makin\u2019 cold calls.",
        "Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.",
        "Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.",
        "Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling.  Suite 401.",
        "We\u2019re kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio.",
        "Looks like somebody\u2019s got a case of the definitelies.",
        "Sha-bow.",
        "Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.",
        "Nuh. Actually, it\u2019s kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh\u2026 a nine.",
        "Pam\u2019s carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesn\u2019t matter what Pam looks like.",
        "No I wasn\u2019t. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.",
        "Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.",
        "That is our sales pitch and we are stickin\u2019 to it.",
        "Well-",
        "Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-",
        "I love to dance-",
        "Right. Sometimes I\u2019ll just dance for hours in the living room-",
        "Yeah. We are thrilled.",
        "In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn\u2019t that fun, honey?",
        "Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.",
        "Yeah.",
        "One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!",
        "Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.",
        "Oh, my gosh. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to say, \u2018I love you, too, Daddy\u2019. I love you, too.",
        "Message received, little soy bean.",
        "Well, that went pretty well.",
        "We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I\u2019d say we nailed it.",
        "You know what? I\u2019m sorry. \u2018Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What the heck was that?",
        "Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.",
        "No. I know I\u2019m gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don\u2019t know. It was fun to role play, right?",
        "I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I\u2019m so sick of being single.",
        "What do you think of Erin? I mean- she\u2019s- I- She\u2019s kinda cool.",
        "You think I can do better?",
        "Gotta get my goin\u2019 out on.",
        "Wow. H &amp; H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?",
        "Thanks.",
        "Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.",
        "Yes!  And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she\u2019s polished right up, back up to her former glory.",
        "Feel it against your cheek.",
        "You give me a gift\u2013 Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere\u2013 Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor\u2013 Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.",
        "Whoa\u2013",
        "Thank you very much.  Now I\u2019ve got it for you.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Huh.",
        "That really works.",
        "Hey\u2013 oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.",
        "Whoa\u2013  thank you very much.    Oh boy.",
        "You are very welcome.",
        "Have a seat yourself.",
        "Not necessary.",
        "You didn\u2019t have to do that.",
        "Aye-yi-yi!",
        "Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.",
        "You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.",
        "Whoa, whoa Dwight.  I\u2019m going to do this.",
        "No, I insist.",
        "Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.",
        "Ahh.",
        "Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.",
        "What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.",
        "It\u2019s like a little envelope\u2013 there you go.",
        "Surprise!   It\u2019s from everybody.  $15 value.",
        "I did stand up comedy once.",
        "Yeah, I killed.",
        "It was hilarious.",
        "I got it, I got it\u2026 Oh, Tuna beat me to it.",
        "I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so\u2026 it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.",
        "Who\u2019d you get?",
        "Oooooo, saucy.",
        "Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie\u2019s brother.",
        "That\u2019s clever, Debutante.",
        "Well, you do actually.  You\u2019ve got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin\u2019 out of your mouth.",
        "Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?",
        "I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if\u2019n she don\u2019t mind.",
        "Hey there young lady.",
        "I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.",
        "Alright, a plan it is.",
        "I\u2019m a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.",
        "Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie\u2019s.  It\u2019s funny, the guy\u2019s dead the whole time.",
        "Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?",
        "Yeah, OK.",
        "Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.",
        "Did you mean a real date?",
        "Totally\u2026 not.",
        "I didn\u2019t do it!",
        "I am calm.",
        "That\u2019s aerosol spray. It\u2019s terrible for the environment.",
        "Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael \u2018The Machine\u2019 Scott.",
        "Hate the twirl!",
        "I\u2019m so jealous right now.",
        "Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?",
        "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!",
        "Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?",
        "Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.",
        "This is your big day. Come on.",
        "Kay.",
        "Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.",
        "Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the \u2013 America\u2019s biggest financial crisis?",
        "You should get up and say something. You\u2019ve got to be true to what\u2019s in there.  Don\u2019t be a wuss.",
        "I\u2019ve always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .",
        "You wanted to see me?",
        "Is it serious?   Wow.  Andy\u2019s a wittle scared.",
        "Why would people say that?",
        "Andy have a boo-boo tummy.",
        "Would you rather me say \u201cHey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?\u201d",
        "\u201cCrazy diarrhea happening right now?\u201d  Cause things can get real adult real fast.",
        "Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy\u2019s sowwy.",
        "Well if I we\u2019re complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.",
        "I don\u2019t-just people.  For the record, I think it\u2019s pretty fantastic.",
        "Tank you Mr. Elwis.",
        "Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.",
        "The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.",
        "0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!",
        "Don\u2019t worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I\u2019ve worked has had one.",
        "Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.",
        "Great!",
        "Nope!",
        "Jim\u2019s talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!",
        "Number nine, number nine.  Jim Halpert.",
        "Correction.  It was my idea.",
        "That would be employee number three, which would be\u2026 son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.",
        "Oh, really? From what, two to four?",
        "Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you\u2019re not covering anything up?",
        "I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds?",
        "Does it hurt?",
        "Hmm.",
        "I know, right?",
        "Huh!",
        "Yeah! Totally! I admit it! It\u2019s me.",
        "\u201cSeriously?\u201d Are you serious?",
        "Yeah! Totally serious! I\u2019m your Secret Santa! Busted!",
        "Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I\u2019m her Secret Santa?",
        "Okay.",
        "Nnnnya.",
        "I, I thought that you would like it.",
        "Well it\u2019s the thought that counts.",
        "I suppose a gentlemen might\u2026 throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.",
        "Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys!",
        "Great news, Michael. We\u2019re now the official paper supplier of the NFL.",
        "Ok.",
        "Saber.  Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.",
        "You sure it\u2019s saber?",
        "I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.",
        "Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like,  \u201cHey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.\u201d",
        "The ball\u2019s totally in Erin\u2019s court. After the whole drum line thing.",
        "Hey, any fun weekend plans?",
        "Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?",
        "Okay.",
        "That\u2019s as hard as I can hint.",

        "Valentine\u2019s Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine\u2019s Day card, but I didn\u2019t wanna seem \u201ctoo eager,\u201d so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.",
        ": Look alive.",
        "Whoa-oh, traffic jam!",
        "Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!",
        "There\u2019s blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine\u2019s card.",
        "Yeah, well it\u2019s Snoopy and Woodstock.",
        "Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?",
        "Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn\u2019t noticed.",
        "Yeah! It\u2019s Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.",
        "It\u2019s got pheromones in it.",
        "It\u2019s not cause of the smell. I\u2019m just expecting a nosebleed.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, I thought you saw me.",
        "Cool, thanks.",
        "\u2026That was weird.",
        "I don\u2019t even know what that card said.",
        "Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: \u201cCoworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.\u201d",
        "Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don\u2019t like-like you.",

        "It\u2019s not\u2026 Whether or not, you\u2026",
        "Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby\u2019s born tomorrow, he\u2019s going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.",
        "Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don\u2019t get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.",
        "My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.",

        "Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like \u201cOh, this guy\u2019s going to fail this class,\u201d or, \u201cWhat\u2019s this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?\u201d  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, \u201cOh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.\u201d \u2026  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and\u2026  I was jealous.",
        "Ow.",
        "Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It\u2019s really important, so I\u2019m going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.",
        "The fax says \u201cErin, will you have dinner with me?\u201d from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.",
        "Sorry, that\u2019s unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you\u2019re fired.",
        "Oh, God, no.  I\u2019m\u2026  Just read the fax.",
        "I\u2019m\u2026  I\u2019m asking you out.",
        "So, it\u2019s a date.",
        "Yeah, what day?  What day?",
        "Well, that, what\u2019s that one?",
        "Okay.  Let\u2019s do it.",
        "Welcome back Tuna!",
        "Erin go braugh!",
        "Thanks. It\u2019s actually my sister\u2019s old field hockey skirt.",
        "Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d that\u2019s the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.",

        "I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you.",
        "No, no, no, no, no.",
        "I have some good ideas\u2026",
        "You sure?",
        "Hi!",
        "That\u2019s okay, I\u2019m in my \u201cworky-works.\u201d You look amazing!",
        "It is? I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Okay, thanks.",
        "Whoa!",
        "I didn\u2019t know you had a brother.",
        "Well, any brother of Erin\u2019s is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard.",
        "Are we rotating seats, or?",
        "So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?",
        "All right. Formative years.",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s a kilt.",
        "Ooh. It\u2019s coming down out there.",
        "No, I-",
        "Ah. Oh great, now I\u2019m gonna get sick.",
        "Well then no Andy Bernard per se.",
        "Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick.  Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy\u2026  I\u2019m making a sale. Sales.",
        "Give me that",
        "Me likey!",
        "Hey. I guess you probably won\u2019t give me your leads since I\u2019m a jerk salesman.",

        "Are you sure?",
        "Yeah.",
        "All those who agree, say aye  All those opposed \u2013",
        "And I\u2019ll text Erin. She\u2019s really good at this stuff too.",
        "Erin just texted me back. \u2018People love shells from far-away beaches\u201d.",
        "Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.",
        "It\u2019s freezing out here.",
        "Oh wow, thank you. You\u2019re the nicest person I\u2019ve ever met.",
        "This is awesome!",
        "It\u2019s Secretary\u2019s Day. And it is Erin\u2019s and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. . Want to make sure the whole office remembers it\u2019s Secretary\u2019s Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.",
        "I do.",
        "If it wasn\u2019t for secretaries, I wouldn\u2019t have a stepmom.",
        "I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary\u2019s Day.",
        "Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there\u2019s only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary\u2019s Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. .",
        "That\u2019s my girlfriend you\u2019re talking about.",
        "She\u2019s gonna be so psyched.",
        "So\u2026 how was lunch?",
        "Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?",
        "Well, I know.  Just want\u2026 I mean\u2026",
        "Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.",
        "I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.",
        "Specific shout-out..",
        "Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary\u2019s Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend\u2026 in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote  a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It\u2019s a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..",
        "Can we talk about this in private?",
        "Yes.",
        "Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary\u2019s Day?",
        "I was going to tell her, just on my own time.",
        "Who cares? I mean it\u2019s not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it\u2026 I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.",
        "Will you stop walking for one second? That\u2019s it. There\u2019s no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.",
        "A year.",
        "Yeah but that\u2019s it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else\u2026",
        "I didn\u2019t see that movie.",
        "Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary\u2019s Day.",
        "Well, why don\u2019t you just move the M&amp;M\u2019s?",
        "Ehh.",
        "You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh\u2026 I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she\u2019s touching around down there. It\u2019s easy to get confused.",
        "Walk around apple orchards.",
        "Super romantic.",
        "How many dates have you been on?",
        "Mm.",
        "Of course. Yeah, that\u2019s terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.",
        "Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It\u2019s really important.",
        "Yeah, I don\u2019t know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.",
        "What are we gonna do about this?",
        "Let me know what they say.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "What\u2019s up? I got your e-mail.",
        "Okay.",
        "Such as?",
        "What? You don\u2019t know what it meant? How about \u201cAndy is a problem and we must eliminate him?\u201d",
        "Yeah. Hah. Hoo.",
        "Creed\u2019s head of quality assurance. So he\u2019d definitely be wrapped up in this.",
        "Your text said 911.",
        "What\u2019s bad?",
        "Oh, God.",
        "I might have to go public here, but no one\u2019s gonna believe me. Uh\u2026 I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There what is?",
        "We\u2019re printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress.",
        "Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you\u2019re watching this, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve turned State\u2019s witness because I\u2019m in danger because I know too much.",
        "Higher? Okay.  Recently certain events have come to my attention\u2026",
        "Make it higher? Okay.",
        "I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation\u2026",
        "May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger\u2026  ah!  It\u2019s working.  It\u2019s\u2026 I knew it!",
        "We are blowin\u2019 the roof off! Blowin\u2019 the roof off!  Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He\u2019s been my partner through this entire thing.",
        "No secret crying. Hasn\u2019t even opened the tissue box in there.",
        "Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.",
        "How does he feel about it?",
        "Did Donna tell you that?",
        "So you\u2019re just making a giant assumption. You don\u2019t even know the guy.",
        "My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I\u2019ve lived the part. And let me tell you, I\u2019d so much rather play the part on stage.",
        "So\u2026 here\u2019s the thing about infidelity.",
        "How does that work?",
        "In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You\u2019re Ali Larter, I\u2019m Beyonce.",
        "Not this time.",
        "This guy\u2019s a high school baseball coach, right? Let\u2019s go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.",
        "Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let\u2019s go check it out.",
        "Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.",
        "Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum",
        "Baseball!",
        "Where?",
        "Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!",
        "And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.",
        "Whatever. I\u2019m the one blending in.",

        "I know it\u2019s like cricket.",
        "And it\u2019s\u2013there\u2019s\u2013 well, home plate is like a wicket.",
        "Seems pretty well liked by the team.",
        "You do know that high school coaches don\u2019t pay their players.",
        "Great game, coach.",
        "You guys are awesome! Best game I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.",
        "Ha. The other guys can go die.",
        "Baseball! Go talk to him.",
        "Shane. Great game man!",
        "No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.",
        "Ha. No. No. But we\u2019re gay for baseball.",
        "But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.",
        "Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.",
        "I mean, isn\u2019t marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let\u2019s round you out as a person.",
        "I get it, man. I love it. That\u2019s what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.",
        "Of course.",
        "But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!",
        "Come on, get over here.",
        "Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.",
        "I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.",
        "Do you want someone to stop you? \u2018Cause no one\u2019s going to.",
        "If you say anything, so help me God, I\u2019ll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.",
        "So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It\u2019s how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us.  Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?",
        "Uh\u2026",
        "I, I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t do that!",

        "Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been\u2026 Jim.",
        "Gabe, I told you all about the printers.",

        "Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?",
        "Look, I didn\u2019t want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I\u2026",
        "Well, it doesn\u2019t make me the worst guy in the world, either.",
        "Hey.",
        "Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.",

Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you\u2019re a murderer. My character doesn\u2019t know that yet. But I\u2019m suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you\u2019re a barber, so that\u2019s legit. So there\u2019s that. But\u2026",

        "You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t.",

You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you\u2019re gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that\u2019s gonna be different is you\u2019ll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who\u2019s gonna buy one right now?",

        "It\u2019s a photocopy from your notebook.",
        "No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.",
        "What?",

        "I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don\u2019t know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I\u2019m not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.",
        "Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley\u2026 you may think he\u2019s a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he\u2019s hard to love, but did you know that he\u2019s in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?",
        "Meredith Palmer\u2026 Supplier relations. The word \u201cno\u201d not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I\u2019m being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.",
        "Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.",
        "Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we\u2019re gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "I don\u2019t care.",
        "Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.",
        "Well, you got it this year too.",
        "Night.",
        "Night.",
        "I gotta say, I think it\u2019s kinda cool not knowing. It\u2019s like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It\u2019s kinda sophisticated.",
        "Creed! Wha-  This is a safety issue with you. There\u2019s no way to know if you\u2019re dead!",
        "Kevin, I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do.",
        "Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what we\u2019re talking about is\u2026basically the speech equivalent\u2026 to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need use\u2026but need need for talk talk.",
        "What are you gonna do with all this time?",
        "Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight\u2019s meeting.",
        "I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties\u2026and tie clips.  Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more?  What do you think, C-SPAN?",
        "Yeah.  C-SPAN, cocker spaniel.  Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause\u2026\u2026",
        "I am still forming a first impression with Robert.  Once it is formed, we can all relax.  Ok, I\u2019m sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog\u2026had to pull rank.",
        "Hi Dad!\u2026\u2026 Ahhh\u2026.oh boy.",
        "Are you factoring in the\u2026 whole national \u2026economy\u2026. declining and all that?",
        "I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor\u2026.vanilla?",
        "You were saying you chose me\u2026. There was a reason?",
        "Can I inspire?  I don\u2019t know!\u2026..I don\u2019t know.",
        "Why don\u2019t we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.",
        "I\u2019ve been craving a freezing cup of old coffee.  Mmm\u2026.",
        "I do.",
        "You know, we\u2019ve both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up.  Now we\u2019re in this weird dance\u2026.",
        "You got it.",
        "Done.",
        "Neither am I, it\u2019s already done.  Hah, I\u2019m just kidding, it\u2019s going to take some time.",
        "What\u2019s up, guys? Just thought we\u2019d have a little rap session, talk about business\u2026see how things are going? Ahem\u2026",
        "If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert\u2026man.  What a boss.  Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how\u2019s the sales doubling \u2026project going?",
        "OF course not.  There\u2019s no magic button.  You have to summon that.",
        "Dwight, anything?",
        "You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be?  Tuna.",
        "Fart\u2026.. good Sesh.  That leg\u2019s asleep.",
        "D-Bone. There you are.",
        "No, that\u2019s ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about\u2026",
        "I know, right?",
        "Yeah\u2026um, how is everything?",
        "Must be a tough time to be a family farm.",
        "Oof.  What are you gonna do about that?",
        "There\u2019s gotta be some way you can double your beet sales\u2026",
        "Thanks for coming in guys.",
        "Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I\u2019m gonna thank people.",
        "This is what\u2019s under the blanket.",
        "These are incentives.  It\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna double growth. Now, you\u2019re probably all asking yourselves: \u201cWell, how does this work?\u201d",
        "You\u2019re exactly right and you get a point.",
        "Twenty points.",
        "I\u2019ve outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.",
        "There\u2019s lots of stuff.  John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.",
        "I can\u2019t.",
        "Ooh I didn\u2019t mean to offend you, and I hope you\u2019ll forgive me because I am very very\u2026 Sari.  Sixteen points.",
        "That\u2019s a crazy amount of points.",
        "Well, what do you want?",
        "Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work.",
        "I\u2019ll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong.  Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard!",
        "Swear to God, hope to die. Now let\u2019s get to work!",
        "T-bag bone\u2026",
        "Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?",
        "Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years\u2026.and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down.  Now look at him.",
        "You think it has something to do with that incentive program?",
        "Bah\u2026I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.",
        "Hundred and twenty points.",
        "Hey Kevin, what are you doing?",
        "Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of \u201995. Hey there, um, I\u2019m a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question.  I may be missing a chapter here\u2026De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale\u2026uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I\u2019m in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations.",
        "Took \u2018em one day.",
        "OK, keep in mind, it\u2019s not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions.  My car  for a thousand points\u2026.or best offer.",
        "We should think about this\u2026does anyone have any better ideas?",
        "Just need a second outside.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? \u2026.Confession: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.",
        "My ass is only so big, I mean I can\u2019t do this everyday.",
        "No one expects me to go through with this, right?",
        "Let\u2019s ink\u2026my stink!",
        "My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.",
        "Do your worst!",
        "They are already off, my good sir.",
        "Well, I think down\u2019s better.  Sweating pretty heavily down there.",
        "This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!",
        "Invest in softer cotton, sir.  OW! Oh! Oooh!  oh, whoa!!",
        "AHHHHH!!!!!!!",
        "It\u2019s a Nard Dog!  That\u2019s my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!",
        "When you\u2019re a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this  But then you learn that\u2019s crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this.  Or better yet, like this.  Now that I\u2019m manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.",
        "Which combo do you think Robert\u2019s gonna like better?",
        "This is combo number seven.",
        "You\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. Uh! It\u2019s so hard to find an occasion for this clip.",
        "Sure.",
        "Thanks T-Dog.",
        "Tuna dog!",
        "I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like \u201cFly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas\u201d Well I don\u2019t know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don\u2019t have any bombs.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don\u2019t have any ideas though.",
        "You do?",
        "Yeah\u2026.I don\u2019t think that\u2019s legal. It\u2019s a nice thought though.  What is this?",
        "You didn\u2019t have to do that.",
        "You\u2019re the only person who\u2019s congratulated me.",
        "Oscar, it\u2019s not that hot out.",
        "Well, we don\u2019t know how long the driver\u2019s been gone and it\u2019s not in direct sunlight.",
        "We\u2019re losing cloud cover.",
        "The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!\u2026and no one else can focus.  This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I\u2019m the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I\u2019m the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I\u2019m the one who has to say those things.",
        "Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I\u2019m gonna change my tone.  To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day.  Darryl, how we doin\u2019 on the new warehouse guys?",
        "What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?",
        "Are they on their way over?",
        "This is kinda time sensitive.",
        "Alright, well until we have a new crew, let\u2019s get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who\u2019s in?",
        "Are you volunteering?",
        "Jim! How \u2019bout you?",
        "Great. And Kevin.",
        "You look awesome.",
        "Where are we in the process?",
        "Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?",
        "You do have a fantastic basement.",
        "Right. Um, well how \u2019bout we take a look at some applications? \u2026This guy wrote his in green ink, that\u2019s pretty cool. Check it out. Hey! There ya go\u2026there he is.",
        "That is not Darryl. I don\u2019t know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.",
        "Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl. What? No Newhart fans? OK\u2026Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?",
        "Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?",
        "Well-",
        "Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you\u2019re all doing great.  maybe grab a coffee..or if there\u2019s any donuts out you can split one. You know they\u2019re for everybody so people get fussy\u2026.You know what? Just have a donut.  Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?",
        "You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so\u2026",
        "Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren\u2019t like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they\u2019re gonna realize I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about.",
        "We need you, OK?",
        "OK?",
        "Alright.",
        "Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we\u2019re gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.",
        "Good. Keepin\u2019 \u2019em honest.",
        "Are we scaring them straight\u2026.?",
        "Is everyone licensed?",
        "No. Warehouse license\u2026.Masters in warehouse sciences?\u2026I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.",
        "No. Not joking. This is real\u2026.painfully real, what is happening right now.",
        "Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap?  You\u2019ll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um\u2026",
        "No. Because they all left.",
        "I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn\u2019t help.",
        "What are you talking about? I\u2019m not gonna fire you.",
        "\u2026..OK, this is weird. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t get the joke.",
        "So Darryl says to me \u201cfire me\u201d. But what he really means is \u201cI\u2019m gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.\u201d So I say \u201cNo, you\u2019re not fired.\u201d But what I really mean is \u201cI have no idea what your talking about, but I\u2019m gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.\u201d\u2026\u2026..I really hope that\u2019s what he and I mean.",
        "Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who\u2019s the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.",
        "Definition.",
        "Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?",
        "Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America\u2019s diminishing blue-collar workforce?",
        "Great\u2026.Well, it\u2019ll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.",
        "Eh, cool. We\u2019ll figure that out.",
        "Got it. Dually noted. You!  Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?",
        "So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That\u2019s what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn\u2019t ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.",
        "Surprise! Your new crew.",
        "Why? Because you didn\u2019t win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Haha, what?",
        "I\u2019m not gonna give you my job! It\u2019s my job! I earned it! And here\u2019s the thing, you weren\u2019t even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.",
        "Nate! Please\u2026.thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D\u2019Angelo, what happened to that?",
        "He didn\u2019t die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I\u2019d be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven\u2019t asked me about it?",
        "None, no part of this has anything to do with you.",
        "Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.",
        "Hey. Here\u2019s the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed.",
        "OK what?",
        "Ah, OK.",
        "Yeah.  That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.",
        "What is goin\u2019 on?!",
        "Why is the truck empty?",
        "No, Jim. Tell us why it\u2019s called Se\u00f1or Loadenstein.",
        "Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?",
        "What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?",
        "How\u2019d it look?",
        "No.",
        "What?  Morning, Stanley.",
        "Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?",
        "Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.",
        "Which one did you see?",
        "Yeah, Dwight.",
        "Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m.",
        "It\u2019s just a garden party. Sheesh.",
        "You don\u2019t need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It\u2019s a garden party. You don\u2019t need a reason.",
        "Few other super simple reminders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?",
        "I get it, I\u2019m being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all\u2026 step it up.",
        "This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it\u2019s a garden party.",
        "Aw, ew, please don\u2019t. Not a barbecue. It\u2019s better than a barbecue. It\u2019s dignified, quieter, there are rules.",
        "I\u2019m glad you asked \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Connecticut Casual.",
        "Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother\u2019s promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there\u2019s a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet.",
        "It\u2019s my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn\u2019t really support another harmony part, so\u2026 Check it out, that\u2019s my brother\u2019s boss. Look how psyched he is, he\u2019s having an awesome time.",
        "Yeah, of course. Ye\u2026 I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did.",
        "See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.",
        "Ooh, that sounds great.",
        "Sure.",
        "Uh, I\u2019ll hear the other one.",
        "You know, the marmalade sounds great.",
        "Then the basil will be fine.",
        "How\u2019s it going over here, guys?",
        "Didn\u2019t mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you\u2019re able, keep your elbows off the table.",
        "Well, technically FOR Andy.",
        "I don\u2019t know how you got there.",
        "This branch, I\u2019m the regional manager.",
        "Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That\u2019s crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn\u2019t care less.",
        "Can I introduce you around now?",
        "What are you going to see?",
        "What??",
        "I didn\u2019t know you were going to be here.",
        "Welcome.",
        "Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.",
        "Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.",
        "So pretty today.",
        "Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn\u2019t make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.",
        "Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That\u2019s my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.",
        "Let\u2019s hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?",
        "You can\u2019t triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!",
        "Ah, come on!",
        "Yes!",
        "Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets?",
        "Saying I love you is not the words\u2026",
        "Yeah?",
        "Right, it feels strange.",
        "Saying I love\u2026 Saying I love you\u2026",
        "Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!",
        "Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.",
        "Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I\u2019d very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn\u2019t even my worst sales call.",
        "I don\u2019t know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you\u2019d be proud of me.",
        "I know, I know that you\u2019re proud of me.",
        "Hey everybody, I\u2019m gonna leave and I just wanted to say I\u2019m really sorry.",
        "Um, cheeseburger.",
        "Thanks, Oscar.",
        "Hey guys, getting psyched for the party? Ryan? Can I count on you to wear an understated satirical outfit?",
        "Awesome.",
        "Oh, oh, oh, Kevin. I am reminded of a lame but useful saying I learned as a kid. What is the difference between Hors d\u2019oeuvres and the animals on Noah\u2019s ark?",
        "With Hors d\u2019oeuvres we only take one at a time.",
        "My parents are used to a certain type of class. The people that I work with are a different type of class. One is not better than the other, it\u2019s just that maybe one\u2019s a little higher than the other?",

        "I\u2019ve decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules \u2013 don\u2019t be offensive, don\u2019t be cliche, and don\u2019t take the first two rules too seriously.",

        "Ah, it\u2019s, uh\u2026 somebody\u2019s already called that.",
        "Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.",
        "Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It\u2019s like, I can\u2019t choose. They\u2019re both amazing. It\u2019s just\u2026",
        "I thought you were at your sister\u2019s funeral.",
        "Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?",
        "There you go. Thank you.",
        "Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I\u2019m not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just\u2026 wanna make sure this is the best we can do?",
        "I just got a text from Broccoli Rob \u2013 \u201cBoo!\u201d Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California \u2013 \u201cLooking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high.\u201d Scared the s**t out of me.",
        "G\u2019day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?",
        "Australian accent\u2026",
        "Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we\u2019re under a Jack attack!",
        "Yes.",
        "Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We\u2019re still getting it set up, it\u2019s gonna be really cool.",
        "Hey. What\u2019s up?",
        "Yeah\u2026",
        "Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.",
        "Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.",
        "Yes.  I don\u2019t know. Mmhmm.",
        "It really looks great.  You did a great job.",
        "We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45?  Cool.",
        "What\u2019s the story?",
        "I think we\u2019ve seen enough.  You can turn it off now.   Yeah turn it off now.",
        "That was awful.  Robert I apologize.",
        "What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.",
        "Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasn\u2019t.   I\u2019m sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.",
        "Ok.  Erin I think you know I\u2019ve been dating someone.",
        "And it\u2019s getting a little more serious.  She\u2019s never come by.",
        "No I didn\u2019t want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now it\u2019s weird that she\u2019s not calling.",
        "Thirty-one.",
        "Hey everybody it\u2019s closing time. You don\u2019t got to go home but you can\u2019t stay here.",
        "Closing time.",
        "Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  It\u2019s weird.",
        "Closing time",
        "One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.",
        "Come on pam!",
        "I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home.  I know who I want to take me home.  Take me hooo\u00e2\u20ac hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don\u2019t want to sing\u00e2\u20ac  no traditions!",
        "Whose your favorite iron chef?",
        "You go first.",
        "Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes\u00e2\u20ac",
        "Umpf\u00e2\u20ac that\u2019s not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.",
        "They\u2019re both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture\u00e2\u20ac",
        "I would agree with that.",
        "End the mistakes, easy-",
        "I would like that.",
        "What do you got?",
        "Sounds controversial.",
        "Do not go there! You\u2019re the deuce I never want to drop.",
        "Go do the voodoo that you do so well.",
        "Mmhmmm.",
        "Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.",
        "And I\u2019d like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call\u00e2\u20ac Dwight\u00e2\u20ac",
        "If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.",
        "Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.",
        "Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.",
        "Dwight\u2019s our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I\u00e2\u20ac",
        "Alright everybody, you are doing great!",
        "Gahhh. That\u2019s five strikes.",
        "Dwight we got five strikes.",
        "Did the email go out or\u00e2\u20ac",
        "Well, th- There\u2019s gotta be a way to stop it.",
        "Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.",
        "What?!",
        "Nn no.",
        "No!",
        "Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.",
        "Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.",
        "Kevin has that lovability.",
        "Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.",
        "Gotcha something.  And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-",
        "Well now hold on it, it-",
        "Where you going?",
        "Dwight, there\u2019s just a small matter of a-",
        "What are you doing? It\u2019s 5 to 5.",
        "That\u2019s insane!",
        "Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.",
        "Enngh-",
        "Oh!",
        "Let\u2019s not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.",
        "Robert, do you wanna smoke pipes during our meeting?",
        "Yes. Of course.  Erin..",
        "Yeah?",
        "I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Yeah. I\u2019m still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let\u2019s hold off on the D-man for now.",
        "Erin.",
        "In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I\u2019m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.",
        "Nobody. Just say that I\u2019m-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I\u2019m going to refuse to take it.",
        "Just make up a phone call. It\u2019s not a real call. Make it up.",
        "And come and tell me. Doesn\u2019t matter what it is.",
        "I\u2019m not going to take it. And then he\u2019s going to be like \u201cwhoa this is a really important meeting\u201d.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I\u2019ll tell you how we can beat it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I\u2019m with a very important client. It\u2019ll have to wait.",
        "There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.",
        "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s dead.",
        "She\u2019s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.",
        "Yeah. Um line 1?",
        "Hi.",
        "Ooh, gosh!",
        "Officer.",
        "Did she have any last words or?",
        "Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.",
        "That is so mom.",
        "Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?",
        "I\u2019m delivering it from the fridge. It\u2019s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?",
        "Yeah and we\u2019re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you\u2019d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.",
        "Uh you tell me",
        "Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.",
        "Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.",
        "Hey Robert, are we meeting early?",
        "Well we\u2019re all musicians and we play together sometimes.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!",
        "CEOs don\u2019t play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.",
        "Great!",
        "I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you\u2019re in a rock and roll band with somebody, you\u2019re bonded for life!",
        "Yeah, even cooler.",
        "Yeah, absolutely!",
        "Midnight what?",
        "Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?",
        "Well, we are playing. We\u2019re all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It\u2019s a jam session. We go where the music takes us.",
        "Maybe we could switch instruments.",
        "\u2018Cause, uh, my body\u2019s starting to get bruised.",
        "We had to leave because of creative differences.",
        "Well-",
        "Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.",
        "Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It\u2019s okay.",
        "Hey guys, uh, can\u2019t keep saying you\u2019re going into labor. Everyone knows you\u2019re full of it.",
        "Never cry wolf.",
        "What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it\u2019s like a war out there.",
        "I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I\u2019m turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America\u2019s bloodiest battle.",
        "Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?",
        "Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-",
        "That sounds super inspiring! I\u2019m in!",
        "Charge!",
        "Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?",
        "Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.",
        "You know, it\u2019s the same as the kosher option. There\u2019s a lesson in there. I mean, I can\u2019t force you to go. You\u2019re not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But\u2026 who\u2019s coming with me?",
        "Anyone who\u2019s not going, you\u2019re dead to me. You\u2019re uninvited. I don\u2019t want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.",
        "One for you.",
        "And one for you.",
        "And- oh. You missed your head.  There you go. Phyllis, think fast!",
        "All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns\u2019 Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.",
        "It\u2019s just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper\u2019s birthplace, I\u2019d be the first one suggesting it. I\u2019d be rooting for it.",
        "All right, all right, all right.",
        "You guys\u2026",
        "Get excited!",
        "All right! We\u2019re here. Limitless can wait.",
        "Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.",
        "Woo!",
        "Whoa, where you going?",
        "Yeah, we\u2019re not going to the visitor center. We\u2019re not tourists.",
        "Unless you\u2019re going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.",
        "After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.",
        "We don\u2019t need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we\u2019re going. Giddy up! Tallyho!",
        "Let\u2019s talk about food for a second. Food for thought.",
        "Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.",
        "Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn\u2019t about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys?  I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.",
        "We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We\u2019re all part of a business. But business is war. What\u2019s that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what\u2019s going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who\u2019s gonna get the flag? Who\u2019s getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don\u2019t look where I am, look where I\u2019m going. Juke right, juke left.",
        "Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!",
        "Spangler Springs is a mile this way.",
        "Its\u2026 I mean come on.",
        "Alright fine.  You know what \u2013 I guess this place just hasn\u2019t rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would.  I\u2019m still going.  And I\u2019m not going to ask anymore.  I\u2019m not even going to look back.  I\u2019m just going to assume that you\u2019re with me.",
        "Dammit.",
        "You guys came.  Where\u2019s everyone else?",
        "Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  I guess he follows orders.",
        "Even without an audience you\u2019re still at it.",
        "Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  That\u2019s what you did with this trip.",
        "You don\u2019t like the hats?",
        "They just didn\u2019t turn out how I wanted.  In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.",
        "The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that\u2019s good because I was basically wrong.  I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess it\u2019s really more like they\u2019re just people who work in an office and I\u2019m their manager.  Yeah that\u2019s really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.",
        "Charge!",
        "It\u2019s kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.",
        "Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.",
        "Water.",
        "Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.",
        "Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil\u2019s Den. It\u2019s the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.",
        "Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it\u2019s not cool.",
        "That is what I\u2019m showing you.",
        "Everybody beat it. Don\u2019t beat it, stay where you are.",
        "What did you say?",
        "What would you say?",
        "That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you\u2019re new name is Phyllis Order , get it?",
        "Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.",
        "Andrew\u2026 Baines\u2026 Bernard.",
        "Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it\u2019s like taking a test, but I know the answers.",
        "What was that?",
        "Hey there. It\u2019s a pleasure.",
        "I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We\u2019re 100 percent staffed up.",
        "Alright.",
        "Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.",
        "We will start here at Erinville.",
        "Reception. Your classic one-man operation.",
        "I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.",
        "I\u2019ll explore exploring it.",
        "Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller.  Alright have at it. Let \u2018er rip. What do you hate about this place?",
        "Jim?",
        "You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.",
        "Dwight why don\u2019t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.",
        "Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? . The entire office is being nice to her than they\u2019ve ever been to me. What I wouldn\u2019t give for one of Phyllis\u2019 classic room clearing farts right now.",
        "But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.",
        "Those are fully staffed as well.",
        "Yes.",
        "Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-",
        "There are lots of considerations.",
        "Alright. Well then welcome aboard.",
        "We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting.  Hang on. Hello?",
        "Hi gam-gam.",
        "Are you taking your med-meds?",
        "We promised we\u2019d never say goodbye.",
        "Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn\u2019t want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.",
        "I am not asking, I am ordering.",
        "It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you\u2019re up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.",
        "What is going on?",
        "Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don\u2019t you?",
        "Why would you say that?",
        "It\u2019s not that, exactly.",
        "Let\u2019s just say that if you don\u2019t want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "Yes! The dude is an enigma.",
        "Ah\u2026",
        "Cameras\u2026",
        "It just was one of those things-",
        "Yes?",
        "No games?",
        "Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, \u201cin four seconds, my wife\u2019s gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.\u201d",
        "I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.",
        "No, it\u2019s not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.",
        "No, no. No, no, no! Don\u2019t! Damn it, Tuna!",
        "Jim, I\u2019ve had enough of your unhelpfulness.",
        "I think we\u2019ve got ourselves an answer.",
        "That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.",
        "Uh\u2026",
        "Yep.",
        "Hey, Mrs. California.",
        "You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Who knows?",
        "Totally.",
        "Hmm?",
        "So, Roberto Californio doesn\u2019t want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that\u2019s impossible.",
        "Ugh! He\u2019s always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?",
        "Christmas tiiiime is heeeere!  Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I\u2019m Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.",
        "Who\u2019s excited to get their holiday wishes?",
        "What\u2019s that, Stanley?",
        "It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.",
        "Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.",
        "That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.",
        "Light side.",
        "As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent\u2026.beachfront.",
        "So, who\u2019s wish is next? Oh, what about Santa\u2019s wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica\u2026.C\u2019mon guys, Jessica?\u2026Jim, tell \u2019em who Jessica is.",
        "Ugh! Gam-gam\u2019s name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?",
        "Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that\u2019s not serious, by the way? Our repartee.",
        "Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don\u2019t go near Gam-gam.",
        "Well you came to the right place\u2026.Ah, this, this party\u2019ll cheer you right up.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat.  But, this is serious. It\u2019s come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",
        "It wasn\u2019t either of you.",
        "Sh sh sh sh! Don\u2019t look. Who it was is not important\u2026but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.",

        "You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.",
        "My ex is meeting my sex\u2026.which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis\u2026that\u2019s just part of it.",
        "Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you\u2019re not talking about my penis.  Hi.",
        "Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.",
        "Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.",

        "Edgy impressions.",
        "How many drinks have you had tonight? I can\u2019t be driving everybody home.",
        "Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.",
        "Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.",
        "What? \u2026Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.",
        "OK!",
        "Um, yeah, she\u2019s not always like that. It\u2019s um\u2026",
        "Yeah, uh, excuse me.",
        "Yep.  Hey!",
        "Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?",
        "OK\u2026maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.",
        "Ah, OK.",
        "That\u2019s not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.",
        "You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn\u2019t here or something.",
        "Hey, you know, you can\u2019t say that, OK? That\u2019s my girlfriend that you\u2019re talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.",

        "I know who did this\u2026.Dwight.",
        "Dwight.",
        "Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.",
        "It\u2019s, I mean.",
        "You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it\u2019s like, hey, can they stay friends?",
        "Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?",
        "No\u2026I don\u2019t, hmm, I don\u2019t know.",
        "By the way, I\u2019m not gonna mess with you and Dwight\u2019s bonuses. I think it\u2019s causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.",
        "Alright, I\u2019ll tell Dwight.",
        "Christmas miracles do happen.",
        "OK great.",
        "Perfect.",
        "I would, it just, that wasn\u2019t the holiday wish.",
        "OK, bye.  Alright Meredith,",
        "You bet.",
        "Thank god Erin\u2019s getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed.  and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he\u2019s going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,",
        "Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go.",
        "Hang on.",
        "What?",
        "What is all that?",
        "It\u2019s junk!",
        "You\u2019re a hoarder. My god!",
        "Ah! My Santa suit\u2019s stuck.",
        "Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.",
        "Oh my god.",
        "Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.",
        "I\u2019m sure I am not. Let\u2019s get you home.",
        "Whoo.",
        "Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn\u2019t put the alcohol out till 11AM. It\u2019s just\u2026common\u2026decency.",
        "It\u2019s come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",
        "Don\u2019t look. Who it was is not important\u2026but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.",
        "For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.",
        "Oh, I see.",
        "Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold\u2026.",
        "Alright, you got it.",
        "\u2026and an American Express green card.",
        "Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.",
        "Well I\u2019ll do you one better.",
        "I got you health insurance.",
        "Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I\u2019m gonna be expecting a lot more from you\u2026no more zoning out in your office.",
        "Yes!",
        "It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!",
        "Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?",
        "Books! Excellent, Jim.",
        "Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper?",
        "I\u2019m talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let\u2019s get high on our own supply!",
        "Yes!",
        "Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That\u2019s today. And we\u2019re eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can\u2019t afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that\u2019s in my garage.",
        "Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they\u2019re willing to \u201cplay ball.\u201d Those were his words.",
        "So make that error!",
        "Well, it\u2019s just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it\u2019s a little more complicated than that.",
        "It\u2019s just, I really need a real accountant on this.  What do you say?",
        "Oh.",
        "What?",
        "You know what? Go. Have fun.",
        "There\u2019s a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.",
        "I didn\u2019t even say what it is.",
        "But here\u2019s the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase\u2026",
        "Yeah? You like it?",
        "All right.",
        "I\u2019m so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, \u201cthis sounds really stupid.\u201d",
        "There is one problem with this plan.",
        "We\u2019d have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.",
        "You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.",
        "I\u2019ve got a quota to hit. I don\u2019t care how I hit it.",
        "Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?",
        "It says that I believe that my staff\u2019s intelligence and that I\u2019m willing to try anything.  Not anything.",
        "Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it\u2019s winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.",
        "A-team.",
        "All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except\u2026",
        "Oh, we got this!",
        "Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.",
        "You\u2019re my sports guys! You\u2019re ESPN, you\u2019re ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I\u2019m E!, TLC and Oxygen.",
        "So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.",
        "Whoo! Yeah!",
        "Go Einsteins!",
        "Oh, come on!",
        "Einsteins! Great work.",
        "You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?",
        "Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.",
        "Alright, if you\u2019re not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.",
        "Not helping, tuna.",
        "We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert\u2019s face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.",
        "No, that\u2019s why\u2026that\u2019s why I said think of it.",
        "Have I mentioned that it\u2019s also quite good for amateur animation?  Took me two weeks.",
        "Jessica! I love you! That\u2019s a message from my mom.",
        "My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I\u2019m just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven\u2019t proposed to anyone in years\u2026 Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but\u2026",
        "Um, I\u2019m getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.",
        "Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s pretty serious poolage.",
        "Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener.",
        "No, I\u2019m good.",
        "Hi.",
        "It\u2019s great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.",
        "Well, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.",
        "No. What?",
        "All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.",
        "Okay.",
        "In a minute. In a minute.",
        "A minute would be cool.",
        "Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?",
        "Where\u2026",
        "No thanks.",
        "Kelly, that\u2019s a crazy ring you found.",
        "I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?",
        "The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?",
        "You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yay!  Whoa!",
        "I cannot believe you\u2019re still up!",
        "Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-",
        "Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis\u2019s birthday.",
        "Mmm.",
        "Last I checked, I\u2019m with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It\u2019s monogamy for my hog \u2018n me.",
        "We\u2019re done. Erin and I are over.",
        "Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.",
        "Wow.",
        "Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?",
        "Duh.",
        "Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it\u2019s not a special night.",
        "Honestly Erin, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2026 I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Thank you.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, it sounds like it.",
        "Bring it on guys.",
        "Let\u2019s go before I vomit.",
        "Alright! Here we go.",
        "Hey! High-five!",
        "Val, I need the space.",
        "Everybody out.",
        "I can\u2019t promise what I\u2019m going to do or not do.",
        "Obviously I\u2019m going to clean up.",
        "Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who\u2019s saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re uptight, you can\u2019t dance,\u201d and then you have to be like, \u201cOh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!\u201d And then\u2026 we dance. Oh how we dance.  Sex also works.",
        "Hey! Tuna! He\u2019s back.",
        "Oh, look at this.  Tuna wrap.",
        "Hand roll.",
        "Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?",
        "What\u2019s up, gangstas?",
        "Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.",
        "No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.",
        "Here, right there.  Down the hatch.",
        "Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.",
        "Yeah, sure, of course. I\u2019d fire him to Timbuktu.",
        "I feel terrible getting lied to. No one\u2019s ever lied to me before.",
        "No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?",
        "Do you know why you never heard of it?",
        "Covered it up.",
        "They used to call me King Tut because I\u2019m so good at keeping things under wraps.",
        "My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.",
        "Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.",
        "Why? Everybody\u2019s heard it.",
        "Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole \u2018Murder, She Wrote\u2019 thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.",
        "Why? Why?",
        "His car broke down. So he called me, \u2019cause I live near the courthouse.",
        "Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.",
        "We\u2019re getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?",
        "I\u2019m not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can\u2019t keep spinning gold out of your .",
        "I don\u2019t even know what the truth is anymore.",
        "Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn\u2019t, then I hope I die.",
        "Dwight, cut it out. I\u2019m not firing Jim.",
        "I know what I said. Jim, you\u2019re in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I\u2019m going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye.",
        "Aw! You guys. He\u2019s licking on my finger, just like my cat does.",
        "Oh!",
        "Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?",
        "There\u2019s cross-hatching in some of these. That\u2019s kind of advanced for a two-year-old.",
        "Hey, Cece, why don\u2019t you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?",
        "Hey, we\u2019ll be just fine.",
        "Oh, whew!",
        "Dwight, what the hell? You can\u2019t smoke in here.",
        "So you effectively spent what\u2026four dollars on the entire office?",
        "You\u2019re nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-",
        "Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he\u2019s like to say.",
        "No.",
        "That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-",
        "Ho hah!\u2026.oh, shoot.",
        "Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she\u2019s no longer pregnant.  Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!",
        "Dwight, I have exciting news for you.",
        "I think you\u2019re going to like it.",
        "Oooh, maybe I can.  I got an email\u2026 from corporate\u2026.that told me that\u2026",
        "That\u2026 you got a promotion!  Right? I mean that\u2019s not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.",
        "No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.",
        "And here\u2019s some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s weird that I said that last one.",
        "Uh yeah, look at that.",
        "Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.",
        "You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?",
        "Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?",
        "They\u2019re not expendable exactly, I just can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t think of the word I\u2019m trying to find.",
        "Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here\u2019s your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you\u2019re also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.",
        "You have your team.",
        "Mooshie mooshie.",
        "Well uh\u2026well the deliberations were confidential so\u2026I feel like we should respect that.",
        "Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!",
        "I use the word \u201cguys\u201d a lot when I\u2019m nervous\u2026guys.",
        "Guys! Guys! Guys!",
        "Guys..",
        "Dudes\u2026the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.",
        "Wha-",
        "OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I\u2019m happy to hear you out.",
        "No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.",
        "Five to six hours?",
        "No no no no.",
        "Nope.",
        "Thirty minutes!",
        "Or both?",
        "Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yeah, wow. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re not all experiencing the same winter?",
        "Well\u2026",
        "Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?",
        "Well it wouldn\u2019t be hard to find someone to fill in..",
        "Tuns, I\u2019m really sorry. You\u2019re too essential to the operation here, I can\u2019t let you go.",
        "OK, listen up everyone, here\u2019s who\u2019s going to Florida: Kathy..",
        "\u2026.Stanley..",
        "\u2026Ryan\u2026",
        "\u2026Erin\u2026",
        "\u2026And, Jim.",
        "Safe travels.",
        "Oh, K. It\u2019s only three weeks.",
        "Ahh!  Sorry I couldn\u2019t resist. It\u2019s so quiet.",
        "It\u2019s so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin\u2026  I thought that would be cooler.",
        "Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.",
        "Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow.  In the trash.",
        "Oh! There we go! Pam?",
        "Can you get the phone?",
        "Mm, well, you used to be.",
        "Phone\u2019s ringing.",
        "Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin.  Hello, you\u2019ve reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?",
        "Yeah, I figured we\u2019d keep things savory while Oscar\u2019s mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.",
        "Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.",
        "Up high.",
        "Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy.  I put out some new magazines, check it out.",
        "I\u2019m acting like I like reception and I\u2019m a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks.  Oh, there\u2019s the phone!",
        "Mail call!  His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail \u2019cause it\u2019s your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen\u2026 yogurt.",
        "Yes I am, as a matter of fact.",
        "I found my calling.",
        "Ugh! Fine. Did you see this?",
        "I mean\u2026",
        "Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.",
        "Oh, she\u2019s on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.",
        "I miss her too.",
        "Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There\u2019s nothing harder than taking care of a boat\u00e2\u20ac am i right?",

        "Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now\u2026  I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.",
        "Of course they have. Which is why I\u2019m giving you a key to my house.  Whatever you need \u2013 anytime, night or day \u2013 you just stop on by.",
        "Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe\u2026 you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.",
        "Yes, yes, yes!",
        "You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don\u2019t, and I will find another buyer.",
        "It\u2019s just business.",

        "You got a minute?",
        "I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.",
        "Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.",

        "I\u2019m- I\u2019m good, thank you. And how are you?",
        "Look, I\u2019m not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I\u2019m moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants\u2026",

        "This is getting more and more delicious by the minute.  It\u2019s go time.",
        "Hey Nellie, I made soup \u2013 I made you some soup.",
        "But it\u2019s really good-  Oh!",

Okay. Yeah. Okay.  Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!",
        "I\u2019m not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.",
        "Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum \u201cSuck It\u201d to the U.S. military.",
        "I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.",
        "Stop saying my name.",

        "What?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Wow. From janitor to manager?",
        "That\u2019s quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.",
        "From total loss to total boss, I mean-",
        "I was so looking forward to that and it did not\u2026 go as I thought it would.",
        "Guess I\u2019d better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.",
        "Gosh, I hope so.",
        "Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.",
        "It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever\u2019s on your mind.",
        "No.",
        "Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?",
        "I just want one mother delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?",
        "If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?",
        "All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?",
        "Gymnasts? You\u2019re going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?",
        "Mm. Mm-hmm.",
        "Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!",
        "What're you still doing here?",
        "You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.",
        "See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It's Clark and, um\u00e2\u20ac\u201d",
        "In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.",
        "Cause you're always taking dumps.",
        "Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.",
        "No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.",
        "Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?",
        "Dwight, Jr!",
        "David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.",
        "Yeah, I gotta go David.  Why is Nellie still here?",
        "Mm, then I will make up a cause.",
        "Then forget I just told you that.",
        "Now I know why Michael hated you so much.",
        "I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It's going to be terrible.",
        "No I'm going to make sure that it is. And if it isn't, I'm going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don't like to throw around the b-word, but I'm going to be a huge bitch to you.",
        "Now this is called slack lining.",
        "I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.",
        "If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you'll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.",
        "That's me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.",
        "All right, who's next? Nellie?",
        "Nonsense. Get up here.",
        "Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?",
        "Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa!  You suck. Alright, who's next? Darryl?",
        "Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.",
        "Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.",
        "Focus on the horizon.  Whoa! Look at this guy.",
        "Hey, yes.",
        "Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.",
        "Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?",
        "Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.",
        "There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.",
        "Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.",
        "Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.",
        "I\u2019m not doing it for you. I\u2019m doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.",
        "Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?",
        "Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition?",
        "Really?",
        "Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff.",
        "Awesome.  Plop!",
        "Her body. We\u2019re gonna talk about her body.  Good. Great job.",
        "Erin has an audition to be a newscaster.",
        "Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.",
        "Yeah, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.",
        "She\u2019s gonna be amazing. Look at her. She\u2019s gonna light up the screen.",
        "I love it. It\u2019s fantastic. Now, tag it with your name.",
        "Pause after \u2018news\u2019.",
        "No, pause longer.",
        "Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don\u2019t be shy.",
        "Wha, it\u2019s-",
        "OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "All right!",
        "Nice.",
        "Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can\u2019t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.",
        "He sure did.",
        "Just, you sure Clark?",
        "No, I just, I don\u2019t mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn\u2019t feel good about that.",
        "I don\u2019t think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.",
        "All right.",
        "Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something?",
        "OK.  I\u2019ll call you later.",
        "So this is a single.",
        "Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.",
        "Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.",
        "As in\u2026",
        "Wow!",
        "This is super-flattering. She\u2019s the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.",
        "My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.",
        "Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh\u2026I\u2019m related to Michelle Obama.",
        "There he is!",
        "Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?",
        "It\u2019s me!  I am related to Michelle Obama.",
        "I mean, it\u2019s distant, but\u2026",
        "Right?",
        "Darryl said, \u201cCool, man.\u201d He called me as cool man.",
        "What\u2019s going on here? I\u2019m related to the first lady, okay? Get over it.  I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! .",
        "Why? Is it employee\u2019s day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.",
        "Does anyone else think it\u2019s possible that I come from slave owners?",

        "Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!",
        "Huh huh huh. Look, I\u2019m not gonna lie to ya, I\u2019m a teensy bit distracted right now.",
        "Right on, brotha. Wurddd.",
        ". Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?",
        "So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I\u2019m trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.",
        "Not my slaves, my ancestors\u2019. Maybe. Probably not.",
        "That you\u2019re learning a made-up language from HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones?  I have a lot going on today\u2026but this was a great nerd-out!",
        "Hi guys.",
        "Yeah. You don\u2019t have to ask me.",
        "Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be\u2014.  Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny.

        "I\u2019ve done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I\u2019m not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol\u2019 family closet. For example, Phyllis\u2019s great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.",
        "Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.",
        "No. Not that I see here.",

        "And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.",
        "No, I\u2019m proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it\u2019s in the past and it\u2019s not our fault. So we don\u2019t have to talk about it.",
        "Might\u2019ve done. And how\u2026 do you figure?",
        "You know, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I\u2019m not gonna apologize for my family\u2019s wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society\u2026if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.",
        "We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.",
        "Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I\u2019m trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.",
        "Exactly. Help me po\u2019 mouth, Darryl.",
        "What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?",
        "You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I\u2019m doing all the heavy lifting. I\u2019m coming up with all the ideas here.",

        "Are the \u2018Nard\u2019s hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I\u2019m kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that\u2019s cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so,  him.",
        "Yeah. He\u2019s in rehab actually.",
        "No, it\u2019s in New Mexico.",
        "We\u2019re done Meredith.",
        "Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn\u2019t steal.  Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.",
        "Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So\u2026what else we got? Non-boat ideas.",
        "Alright, what\u2019s the grand total? Did we make our nut?",
        "Guys, you don\u2019t understand, this boat\u2019s been in our family since before I was born.",
        "Alright, uh\u2026alright. I\u2019m gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.",
        "Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don\u2019t need the boat. Can\u2019t cry about it.  What are you gonna do? Cry about it?  Excuse me.",
        "Uh, did you need something?",
        "Ok.  thanks.",
        "Look, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want-",
        "All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn\u2019t let me. Said \u201cYou can\u2019t be a skipper until you\u2019re a man.\u201d You know, I\u2019d reach for the wheel and he\u2019d smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I\u2019m the man of the family and\u2026 we\u2019re selling the damn thing. So I\u2019m never gonna have the chance.",
        "Tonight.",
        "Yeah right. It\u2019s in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.",
        "Yeah, ok.",
        "Seriously?",
        "Alright.",
        "Let\u2019s do it.",
        "That\u2019s the family boat!",
        "Right?",
        "Sorry?",
        "Sure, I um..I didn\u2019t know.",
        "Ok.",
        "Geez, a little bit.  How you doing old buddy? Missed you.",
        "It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.",
        "Really?",
        "Up she goes!",
        "Oh, it\u2019s OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.",
        "You got it. You know what then, we\u2019ll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor.",
        "You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just-  wow.",
        "Ok, fine.",
        "Yeah, fine.",
        "Good stuff. Nice stuff.   Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.",
        "I\u2019ve had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.",
        "Fine. But I could have.",
        "I am the captain.",
        "Right?",
        "I\u2019m the captain.  Hey, charm school.",
        "I\u2019m taking it over from here.",
        "Yeah, I know cause I\u2019m sailing it there.",
        "Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?",
        "Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to\u2026I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello.   Walt?",
        "I thought you were in rehab.",
        "I didn\u2019t.  I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat.  But I\u2019ve decided to sail it to Bermuda.",
        "Same thing.  Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.",
        "Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you.  Do you realize that? You\u2019re the best ever!",
        "Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World\u2019s Greatest. You did this! Dammit I\u2019m happy!",
        "I\u2019ll see you in three weeks!",
        "No way!",
        "Erin I gotta go! Them\u2019s my chords!",
        "Ah, what else? I\u2019ve seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times.  Breaks my heart every time, you know?",
        "That Swayze sure can dance dirty.",
        "No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes.  They\u2019re like two flaming meatballs in my skull.",
        "Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That\u2019s what I call the sun now.",
        "What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!",
        "Yeah, it was. That\u2019s okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!",
        "Ah! That\u2019s not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know?",
        "I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.",
        "No. No! Nooo!",
        "Hi Dwight.",
        "Well, well, well, look who it is.",
        "I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.",
        "Hey! Sweetheart!  I have missed you so much.",
        "I have been dreaming of this moment.",
        "Well, Valentine\u2019s surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something.  Oh, it\u2019s a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It\u2019s so we can play island music together. Cause I have this.  Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop \u2019em. It\u2019s called Bembe.",
        "Obviously, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine\u2019s Day, sweetheart.  But, I\u2019m just saying, I\u2019m also excited about the Wallace meeting.",
        "I have no idea. I don\u2019t know what he knows or doesn\u2019t know. But we\u2019ve been in touch the whole time. I mean, it\u2019s not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It\u2019s in every Bembe cafe.",
        "Question. Where\u2019s Jim?",
        "For two hours? Really?",
        "If the shoe fits.",
        "I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.",
        "And you sold it to Jan too.",
        "I mean\u2026 I\u2019m impressed.",
        "Well, there\u2019s one problem. Couldn\u2019t help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So\u2026 gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.",
        "I was\u2026",
        "That\u2026",
        "OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio?  Just say the word \u2018coolio\u2019.",
        "Say it.",
        "Coolio.",
        "Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.",
        "Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.",
        "I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.",
        "Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.",
        "No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.",
        "It, it\u2019s, it\u2019s actually just an issue\u2026",
        "Jan, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about but\u2026",
        "Well, ah, ah\u2026",
        "Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.",
        "Hey, everybody, great job.  Listen, we\u2019re a smidge behind on my paychecks.",
        "All right. Thank you very much.  Looking good.  Who\u2019s that little fella?",
        "Wow, that\u2019s wonderful!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Uh-huh\u2026  Uh-huh.  Thank you. Great. Well, we\u2019re all up to speed.",
        "What\u2019s going on in here, dirty players? Let\u2019s get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on.  Who\u2019s that girl? Who\u2019s that girl? It\u2019s Andy!  All right. Back to work.",
        "I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.",
        "Not helpful. Let\u2019s stay positive, people. OK?",
        "Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Great!",
        "We had to let a warehouse guy go?!",
        "What?!",
        "There was a fire in the warehouse?",
        "This is what I\u2019m talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?",
        "What?!",
        "No kidding?",
        "Wow. Go Kathy. She\u2019s like 50.",
        "Good, good. What else?",
        "Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.",
        "The warehouse fire. Weren\u2019t you just down there? It\u2019s like burnt to ashes.",
        "I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that\u2019s one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.",
        "I think you\u2019ll agree I explained that pretty well.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yeah, I guess.",
        "Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?",
        "What?",
        "OK, I get it. You\u2019re unhappy. I\u2019ve been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.",
        "On your side. But there\u2019s tons on my side. It\u2019s gushing. We\u2019re just out of sync right now. But that\u2019s just timing, it\u2019s timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.",
        "I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we\u2019re lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.",
        "I\u2019m gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.",
        "I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won\u2019t be able to tell the difference. So, I\u2019ll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you\u2019ll actually start to love me again.",
        "Yes.  Come on. Totally.",
        "I resent that. I, I never lied to you.",
        "And all was good in Scranton PA that day.",
        "Oscar says \u201chi\u201d all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. \u201cHi\u201d \u201cHello\u201d \u201cHola\u201d You\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve never heard Oscar say \u201chi\u201d?",
        "But you\u2019re calling me a liar.",
        "By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you\u2019ve been telling lately.",
        "Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013.  \u201cHey Andy, all\u2019s well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife\u2019s sick.\u201d Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!",
        "This has been a really tough time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Erin just dumped me and I can\u2019t remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.",
        "It was like a security blan-",
        "-ket",
        "You\u2019re not?",
        "That\u2019s awesome.",
        "David, I\u2019ll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I\u2019ll be there for you. That\u2019s a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.",
        "Crystal.",
        "Vanilla.  Vanilla Ice. It was a band.",
        "Good morning.",
        "And how are you on this fine-",
        "Ok, we ready?  Don\u2019t use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is\u2026brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.",
        "Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh",
        "Where are you going?",
        "Wha? Oh, burn.  Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?",
        "I\u2019m still the boss!",
        "The answer is yes.",
        "Are they from you?",
        "Well then, I don\u2019t want them. You can keep \u2019em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.",
        "Nope, I insist upon it. It\u2019s an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.",
        "I don\u2019t want to talk about work right now.",
        "Then I want my big blue sweater back.",
        "She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?",
        "Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here\u2019s the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.",
        "Survey says: ENH! Doesn\u2019t make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?",
        "Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.",
        "No.",
        "May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you.",
        "Why doesn\u2019t Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn\u2019t she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.",
        "I\u2019m not snooping, there\u2019s just some crud on her screen.",
        "Uh, hello! Who\u2019s snooping on who now?",
        "Everyone please, just-",
        "Oh my god.",
        "Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I\u2019m psycho again. Uh, couldn\u2019t shake this feeling that Erin\u2019s dating someone so I looked at her phone.",
        "Too late. I found out she\u2019s been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?",
        "Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I\u2019m just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted  shlmydia\u2026from Erin. And it\u2019s incurable. Pretty lame huh?",
        "I knew it!",
        "You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!",
        "No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You\u2019re fired!",
        "Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry.  So you had a bad day-",
        "..The camera don\u2019t lie!",
        "You\u2019re being an idiot get..",
        "Out of my office, turns out you\u2019re fired\u2026",
        "Because you suck.",
        "And you\u2019re fired\u2026",
        "So you had a bad day\u2026",
        "Rut ti doh doh\u2026",
        "Rut tit doh doh\u2026",
        "Rut ti doh doo doh",
        "No.",
        "Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.",
        "They already have a contract?  \u201cMutually agree to-\u201d Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.",
        "Well, I\u2019m not signing away my rights.",
        "Ok, well we\u2019ll see about that.",
        "Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.",
        "Ugh.",
        "That doesn\u2019t matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet\u2019s boss also had feelings.",
        "What?!",
        "Sorry.",
        "My whole life is a booger bubble!",
        "Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.",
        "Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.",
        "Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.",
        "Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you\u2019ve just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don\u2019t want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that\u2019s fun.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi, how\u2019s it going?",
        "Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?",
        "Awkward.",
        "Really uncomfortable situation.",
        "It\u2019s alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta \u201cmove on\u201d. Ain\u2019t that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How\u2019s that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm.",
        "Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.",
        "Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone\u2019s day?",
        "Really? Hmm. That\u2019s interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn\u2019t be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?",
        "And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.",
        "We\u2019ll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?",
        "Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better?  Yeah. Yeah, it does.",
        "Wow, you\u2019re right. It is just about the cupcakes.",
        "Oh my god. I forgive him so much.  Whoa, is he choking?",
        "Last night? Oh, god, um, I don\u2019t know.  Na, nothing really. Kevin?",
        "I\u2019m not, a\u2026 I\u2019m just. I don\u2019t know.  Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um.  Pretty normal night.",
        "Yeah. I didn\u2019t see you last night at all.",
        "What?",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?",
        "Well there you go. That\u2019s muy caliente.",
        "Excuse me, dirty birdie",
        "You can have this back at the end of the day.   Oh!!",
        "Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. \u201cBanjo at 0:19 is aight\u201d Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy.  I mean that\u2019s the guy\u2019s name, right? ChobbleGobbler?",

When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.",

It\u2019s a really cool show, it\u2019s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!",
        "This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang \u201cI Dreamed a Dream\u201d from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.",

        "Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.",
        "Nope! Can\u2019t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss\u2019s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.",

I got my dream job at Cornell and I\u2019m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they\u2019re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you\u2019re in the good old days before you\u2019ve actually left them.  Someone should write a song about that."

        "No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "Your body is a temple. You have to respect it. You can\u2019t just whore it out.",
        "I tried. We didn\u2019t have time.",
        "What?",
        "They arrived this morning.",
        "Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?",
        "Everything ok?",
        "Thank you.  I\u2026 I don\u2019t want those.",

        "Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.",
        "Ok.",

But then this gallant gentleman \u2013 we\u2019ll call him Kurt \u2013 he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.",
        "Yes, it is.  Hello?",
        "That\u2019s great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.",

        "Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.",
        "Oscar.",
        "Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?",
        "Yeah.",
        "No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I\u2019ve thought about certain things. And I\u2019m sorry for the way those certain events transpired.  And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Never.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh.",
        "No.",

        "None of them. Especially not Andy.",
        "Are you enjoying your fiesta?",
        "Welcome back.",

        "Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?",
        "Excuse me?  Well, I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s our fault.  And I\u2019ve already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don\u2019t know what you want from me.",
        "Where are you from?  Ohio?  That\u2019s nice.  So what do you want?   He\u2019s upset about the watermark.",

        "I\u2019m not gonna lie and say I\u2019m sorry when the company didn\u2019t do anything wrong. That\u2019s immoral, and this is ridiculous.",

        "Gladly. I quit.",
        "Oh. Thank you, Kelly . And I wish I hadn\u2019t called you stupid.",
        "No, but some of your outfits are not appr-",

        "Hey D.",

She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won\u2019t see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um\u2026 and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she\u2019s eaten. And, oh and there\u2019s a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you\u2019re gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.",

        "That\u2019s why we\u2019re cursed.",

        "I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.",

        "I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.",
        "Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?",
        "Goodie.",
        "Because there\u2019s a party! A party for the website I\u2019ve been planning for two weeks.",

So now I\u2019ve got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there\u2019s no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that\u2019s made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it\u2019s itched all day, and I can\u2019t reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.",
        "I have to hang these.",
        "I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.",
        "That\u2019s why you\u2019re not in charge Meredith.",

        "Tonight my party will be broadcast out to five other states.  Which means, it will be compared to Denise Stimm\u2019s party in Buffalo.  Any idiot can defrost a microwavable hors d\u2019oeuvres platter.  And Denise proves that with every party she throws.  Oh, and Denise?  Stop telling people your hair\u2019s naturally curly.  We all know you get perms.",

        "No I left it on my night table\u2014 your night table, by the lamp.",

        "Yes. Kelly\u2019s was last week, remember?",
        "It\u2019s birthday month. Creed\u2019s is today. Oscar\u2019s is week after next. Meredith\u2019s is at the end of the month.  Michael usually goes with red and white streamers\u2026",
        "What?",
        "I don\u2019t like it.",
        "No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can\u2019t just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.",

        "It\u2019s not my problem.",
        "That is very important to me, so \u2014 I have work to do. Just do it.",

        "How many squares of toilet paper go around the waist?",
        "Kevin, relax.",
        "Yes, that\u2019s correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.",

        "That doesn\u2019t sound like me.",
        "Andy, I\u2019m engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn\u2019t want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake\u2026",
        "A little bit.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and\u2026 I don\u2019t know exactly when we started up again.",

        "Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.",
        "I said nothing fancy.",
        "I love you.",

        "Okay, well, Nick, we\u2019re in a meeting.",
        "It does!",
        "I said I didn\u2019t want to be on the internet!",
        "I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew\u2019s car.",
        "Michael, do something.",
        "Thank you.",
        "",
        "My place tonight. Wear this.",
        "Yes. Don\u2019t forget the pipe.",
        "What the hell is happening?",
        "Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy\u2019s play tonight.",
        "No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.",
        "Well, there\u2019s a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object.",
        "Ugh! There\u2019s gum on the seat and now it\u2019s on my work skirt. I have to go change.",
        "Oh, Dwight, just move.",
        "Come on, Dwight.",
        "These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.",
        "That was more horrifying than Nunsense.",
        "Where\u2019s my car? Come on.",
        "No, actually, Dwight, I didn\u2019t realize how far this walk was, and I-I\u2019m exhausted.",
        "No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it\u2019s okay. This can count as one of your times.",
        "Well, I won\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t.",
        "Good night, Dwight.",
        "Who\u2019s this guy by our cars?",
        "This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah, I can see that.",
        "So, what happened?",
        "KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she\u2019s out.",
        "Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?",
        "This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don\u2019t even want to give Pam a compliment, because she\u2019s so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.",
        "I don\u2019t like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let\u2019s not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.",
        "Jim. Pam.  And the precious bundle of God\u2019s gift to everything.  I wish you both a pleasant day.  And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.",
        "Well, this is intimate.",
        "You don\u2019t know them all?",
        "Jesus is not your caterer.  But he should be your caterer \u2019cause you\u2019re a little angel. Why didn\u2019t your parents get you a caterer?  They don\u2019t think.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "What? Kevin!",
        "Did you think I stole your baby?",
        "Someone put them in my bag.",
        "Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.",
        "Are you going?",
        "I would watch that.",
        "Outside my car in two minutes.",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "Are you authorized to do this?",
        "Ok, uhm, then tell him that we\u2019ll do this tomorrow night instead.",
        "Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?",
        "You know what Pam just save it.",
        "Nosy?",
        "Hey, I\u2019m kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.",
        "No, I meant\u2026",
        "Mm-Hmm.",
        "Perfect!",
        "You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.",
        "It\u2019s a new corporate policy.",
        "",
        "Where have you been?! I\u2019ve been waiting.",
        "No, I\u2013I think you should make time for it.",
        "Dwight?",
        "Sure.",
        "Probably.",
        "Mm-Hmm.",
        "Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place.  Don\u2019t laugh at me.",
        "Oh.",
        "Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day.",
        "Thank You.",
        "You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?",
        "How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.",
        "You never told us to close them.",
        "Michael do something about this.",
        "Really?",
        "Nothing. Should be fun.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t subject Robert to that. He\u2019s a very busy senator.",
        "I would not expect you to know what it\u2019s like to date someone in the public arena.",
        "The senator.",
        "We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller\u2019s wife.",
        "Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. \u201cAngela\u2026\u201d  \u201cover here, Angela\u2026\u201d  \u201chere. Look here!\u201d",
        "No, don\u2019t throw those out!",
        "We can save that.",
        "Just stop moving your calves so much while you\u2019re talking.",
        "Maybe I\u2019ll bring my boyfriend. I\u2019ll invite him.",
        "I mean, unless there\u2019s any chance there could be press at this party.",
        "Well, I only ask because he\u2019s a senator.",
        "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate.",
        "Yes, he is.",
        "It\u2019s so cold. Even with my coat on.",
        "No, it really seems like something Michael would do.",
        "I\u2019m so glad you could come.",
        "Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.",
        "Yes.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "I don\u2019t know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.",
        "I am.",
        "Zip it, Meredith.",
        "You are. You make your own drink.",
        "And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he\u2019s helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they\u2019ve really become a pest.",
        "Yes.",
        "Good morning.",
        "The glitter is blinding.",
        "Yes.",
        "My boyfriend.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Oh, God.",
        "All right!",
        "Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.",
        "I don\u2019t know if anyone else feels this way and don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive, but\u2026 the PDA.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "No one is more thrilled for them than I am\u2026",
        "\u2026but it\u2019s totally inappropriate.",
        "No, stop! Just don\u2019t.",
        "God! Kevin!",
        "Dwight!",
        "With who?",
        "No.",
        "No! Don\u2019t!",
        "Will you marry me?",
        "Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.",
        "Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?",
        "Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he\u2019s a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He\u2019s a great person to know.",
        "Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.",
        "Oh wait, he can\u2019t help because that title has no meaning!",
        "Please.",
        "Everything.",
        "It\u2019s an experiment.",
        "The dream team\u2026 and Meredith.",
        "It was just you\u2026",
        "You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.",
        "Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.",
        "Oh, that\u2019s Thomas, Robert\u2019s aide.",
        "Yeah.",
        "See? This is what happens. You can\u2019t let a stray dog into the house.",
        "Good God\u2026",
        "No! I\u2019m not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don\u2019t really care about your opinion. You\u2019re just a tie-breaker.",
        "Of course you do, Jim.  You\u2019re a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.",
        "Okay.  Then how about I\u2019m the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?",
        "Andy, what are you doing?",
        "No.",
        "Amen.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.",
        "Pet Day! I want Pet Day back \u2013 no dogs.",
        "Four, one, seven, one\u2026",
        "Seven, two\u2026",
        "Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight\u2026",
        "Nine, eight, five\u2026",
        "Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six\u2026",
        "Two, one\u2026",
        "God!",
        "Okay.  How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator\u2019s office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.",
        "Thank you.",
        "It\u2019s a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?",
        "Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet\u2019s Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, \u2019cause it\u2019s so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator\u2019s wife?",
        "Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim.  Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me?",
        "Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide.",
        "Stanley, I won\u2019t be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.",
        "I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding?  Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn\u2019t afford?",
        "Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there\u2019s a great, lively debate here, but let\u2019s think about-",
        "Look, it\u2019s a \u2018Little Pregs\u2019  and \u2018Big Pregs\u2019",
        "Isn\u2019t it amazing, the difference in our sizes?",
        "I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim\u2026 the great salesman.",
        "Did you guys figure it out?",
        "It was excellent.",
        "Bye.",
        "Side salad, chicken piccata on the side.",
        "No, he\u2019s fine.",
        "He\u2019s always been like that.",
        "I mean, he\u2019s gotten worse over the years\u2026.",
        "Have you seen this?",
        "Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?",
        "So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you\u2019re pregnant?",
        "I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?",
        "Great.",
        "Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I\u2019m having.",
        "A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don\u2019t know if I should call social services about it.",
        "Maybe.",
        "In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!",
        "I already did.",
        "Fine.",
        "Sure.",
        "Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby\u2019s birth weight pool.",
        "Yeah. And I said sorry.",
        "Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?",
        "I\u2019ve already gone up another cup size.  The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?",
        "Phillip?",
        "Phillip is the name that we\u2019re using. It\u2019s after my favorite cat.",
        "It\u2019s after my cat.",
        "I would like to toast someone who isn\u2019t here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!",
        "She just always has to copy anything I do! It\u2019s the Ford Taurus situation all over again!",
        "Little Cici asleep?",
        "Such a precious little angel.",
        "Cecilia\u2026.and Phillip.",
        "Phillip is wasted on you. Jim is never gonna take the time to call him Phillip! He doesn\u2019t even take the time to get a haircut. And Phil! Ugh! It\u2019s just something you do to a hole!",
        "You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I\u2019ll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.",
        "Yeah! If I request it he will. And that is that.",
        "I know. I\u2019m taking them down.",
        "Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?",
        "So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.",
        "Pam do you think anyone\u2019s going to notice I\u2019ve worn this costume before?  When I wasn\u2019t pregnant.  You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.",
        "Oh, no.",
        "Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.",
        "Oscar, use a calculator.",
        "You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart &amp; Wolf. Right?",
        "Six-seventy, six-twenty.",
        "yes!",
        "Ohhhh!",
        "Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago \u2018A Beautiful Mind\u2019-",
        "Okay, Andy, we get it. It\u2019s a trip to Gettysburg.",
        "Enough Oscar, enough.",
        "This is all pathetic.",
        "Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.",
        "No. Porcupines don\u2019t have souls. They\u2019re like dogs.",
        "Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?",
        "Yeah, it is, Andy.",
        "Oh, it is warm.",
        "Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!",
        "You\u2019re in my way!",
        "We\u2019re in the pool!",
        "Oh, it is warm.",
        "Yes?",
        "Oh\u2026 I don\u2019t- I don\u2019t want any- what are you guys doing here?",
        "Hey.",
        "No, you will not.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?",
        "Aw, preemie pajamas!",
        "No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.",
        "Shh.",
        "It\u2019s fine. Pajamas aren\u2019t supposed to be baggy, right? It\u2019s not the barrio.",
        "Ah!",
        "Really?",
        "Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.",
        "The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.",
        "Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.",
        "And now you all know, but you can never tell. I\u2019m serious.",
        "Dwight?",
        "He\u2019s hungry.",
        "No, you don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m going to wear this cover.",
        "You won\u2019t see-",
        "Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.",
        "That is completely untrue.",
        "I did not. Uh-uh.",
        "That didn\u2019t happen.",
        "No! Stop it!",
        "Dwight.",
        "And even if it did, it\u2019s just a coincidence.",
        "I will not.",
        "I will not, it\u2019s not-",
        "Yes, yes. He\u2019s sleeping.",
        "Sure.  Watch the head, watch the head.",
        "Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!",
        "I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave.",
        "Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I\u2019ve got brownies and magic cookie bars.",
        "I don\u2019t know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.",
        "Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?",
        "I wouldn\u2019t know, I\u2019m watching my weight. Ugh.",
        "Ok, it\u2019s obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.",
        "My baby is not a monster!",
        "So cute.",
        "News flash \u2013 If you didn\u2019t carry it around for nine months, it isn\u2019t your kid.",
        "That is where we disagree.",
        "My Phillip is crawling.",
        "No one said \u201cyou must have two\u201d",
        "No thank you.",
        "Stop it.",
        "Stop it.",
        "Paid.",
        "Is this spicy?",
        "1434-967, paid.",
        "Black eye, Meredith.",
        "Yes.",
        "Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?",
        "Yes.",
        "Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.",
        "Good point? What is a tub of electricity?",
        "Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Let\u2019s go Kelly.",
        "So, he\u2019s alive.",
        "Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn\u2019t have to work?",
        "\u2018Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don\u2019t stick our noses in other people\u2019s business.",
        "We should do it right here in the break room.",
        "Pam, we have a great idea.",
        "We\u2019re going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It\u2019s gonna make everyone sick.",
        "Okay.",
        "I knew she\u2019d crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.",
        "Nobody\u2019s named Monday.",
        "Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I\u2019d be if Pam died.",
        "On it!",
        "You got it.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Ugh. Eww!",
        "Oh God!",
        "Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight\u2026 I\u2019m sure it will be fine.",
        "My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who\u2019s who of the northern 22nd district!",
        "We think you might kill Robert.",
        "Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.",
        ":  Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t lay an egg.",
        ": Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If?",
        ": I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.",
        "No thank you.",
        "Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?",
        "Heh.",
        "Dwight.",
        "No. I am going to hold him because I haven\u2019t seen him all day.",
        "I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby\u2019s DNA to prove he\u2019s the father. Which\u2026 is impossible\u2026 because the senator is the only man I\u2019ve ever been with.",
        "See the duckie!",
        "No. No. I like the baby\u2019s hair the way it is.",
        "Uh-uh, leave us alone.",
        "Dwight, we\u2019re fine!",
        "Oh no.",
        "I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.",
        "No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!",
        "No! God, Mose! God!",
        "Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?",
        "Yes!  Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!",
        "Where is it?",
        "How long does it take to get the results?",
        "You\u2019re gonna wait here?",
        "Dwight, I can\u2019t do this. Dwight!",
        "I told you",
        "Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.",
        "No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look . He's such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants",
        "Please, after the turtle?",
        "Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?",
        "If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.",
        "Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn't given me a definite yes or no.",
        "Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I'm fine with either, but not both.  Listen, you're in this, but you need to wow me, ok?",
        "Why do you want this cat?",
        "How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?",
        "Have you taken any concrete steps?",
        "Allergies.",
        "No, the baby. Please, it's my husband's favorite cat. He's broken up about it. It's the only time I've seen him cry other than our wedding night.",
        "Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!",
        "Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won't get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight",
        "Please don't teach the cat French.",
        "Um, you have diabetes, Stanley.  I\u2019m sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?",
        "The senator and I still have mystery. I\u2019m always waiting to see what he\u2019s gonna surprise me with next.",
        "Language.",
        "Oh!",
        "OK, I have one. I have one.",
        "Kevin, stop it with that question.",
        "Has she done the pageant circuit?",
        "Ew.",
        "Stop it! Stop it! You\u2019re frightening me!",
        "Ooh!",
        "Oh my god!",
        "I, I need to get to the paper please.",
        "So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?",
        "Oh!",
        "The senator will be joining us later.",
        "No, it wasn't.",
        "And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway\u2026 Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?",
        "Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!",
        "You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!",
        "They lost me when they sang \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMonster Mash'. That song obviously glorifies the occult.",
        "Jammed. This day couldn\u2019t get worse.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Kevin, we\u2019re out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?",
        "I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.",
        "That doesn\u2019t surprise me.",
        "The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.",
        "That man he\u2019s up against is so dirty. And the senator\u2019s just pushing back as hard as he can.",
        "What?",
        "Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in.",
        "Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?",
        "Honey! What are you doing here?",
        "Oscar? What is going on? What was that?",
        "Hi.",
        "Spring cleaning?",
        "I think the senator is having an affair.",
        "I think the senator is having an affair.",
        "When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.",
        "And he\u2019s always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class \u2013 it\u2019s Hot Yoga with Blake.",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "Right.",
        "Right?",
        "What?",
        "Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.",
        "Where?",
        "Oh my God! She\u2019s so stunningly tiny!  She\u2019s like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they\u2019re doing.",
        "I\u2019ve heard of this \u2013 dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail \u2013 ew. I\u2019d like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let\u2019s go.",
        "Ow.",
        "Okay, we should go now. Let\u2019s go.",
        "Wait. Why are you\u2026 Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can\u2019t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire \u2014",
        "What?",
        "Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?",
        "Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?",
        "Oh. Oh.",
        "Oscar\u2026  can I ask you a question?",
        "Is it cool in here to you?",
        "I think the thermostat is acting up again.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.",
        "Ugh!",
        "Dwight, it\u2019s not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.",
        "Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.",
        "My marriage is in danger. I don\u2019t know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.",
        "Something like that.",
        "Can you arrange a meeting?",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ow! Dwight! Ow!",
        "God!",
        "So what are your credentials?",
        "Do you have a gun?",
        "What is this?",
        "You don\u2019t carry it with you?",
        "Obviously.",
        "Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.",
        "Murder.",
        "What if they deserved it?",
        "They\u2019re sleeping with my husband.",
        "Thank you.",
        "No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.",
        "Yes, a knee-capping could work.",
        "You said you would be there for me.",
        "It\u2019s the only thing that will make this right.",
        "Oh, thanks, Oscar. You\u2019re such an angel.",
        "What? Why did you call me out here?",
        "I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.",
        "Fine! It\u2019s Oscar. So what?",
        "Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.",
        "Well, you might be right. But it\u2019s too late now.",
        "He\u2019s here.",
        "No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.",
        "You know, there\u2019s doughnuts in the break room.",
        "You deserved every bit of it! You made my husband gay.",
        "No. No.",
        "Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.",
        "God!",
        "You were supposed to be my friend.",
        "I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.",
        "Jazz is stupid! I mean, just play the right notes!",
        "I don\u2019t like your friend Trevor.",
        "My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.",
        "Well, he didn\u2019t fight me hard on it.",
        "What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?",
        "Is it called red-vining?",
        "People red vine.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, right, like I\u2019m responsible \u2019cause I\u2019m in charge of the party planning committee.",
        "Don\u2019t blame me for something we all forgot.",
        "No!",
        "No.",
        "No, no, no.",
        "Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.",
        "No. I don\u2019t want my name attached to this party.",
        "Please just take my name off of everything.",
        "Huh.",
        "Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!",
        "Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?",
        "Dwight!",
        "Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.",
        "Ew! Oh.",
        "Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.",
        "What do we do about our heads?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Oh.",
        "We don\u2019t want it to last longer. It\u2019s horrible.",
        "Okay. Oh, thank you.",
        "Oscar, do you want to be my partner?",
        "You don\u2019t want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She\u2019s a monster.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Oops.",
        "No, I don\u2019t\u2026 no.",
        "Can\u2019t I just agree without putting my hand in?",
        "Oh, fine.",
        "Ugh!",
        "Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!",
        "Stop it!",
        "Stop it Kevin!",
        "Kevin!",
        "I don\u2019t get the point of this stupid window!",
        "Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?",
        "Shut up!",
        "Yeah!",
        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!",
        "I have no information. But I\u2019m sure as soon as they know, they\u2019ll call you.",
        "Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.",
        "Yes. And he didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped\u2026 with that .",
        "Oscar, don\u2019t rub it in. I\u2019m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.",
        "I don\u2019t want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.",
        "Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It\u2019s Phillip\u2019s first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.",
        "No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.",
        "No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.",
        "What?",
        "I\u2019m his! His\u2026 wife.",
        "We agreed that you wouldn\u2019t be seen with him in public. It\u2019s humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.",
        "Hey!",
        "Exciting news. There\u2019s room for one more at my son\u2019s birthday event. And, I want you.",
        "What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.",
        "No.",
        "Aw, crap.",
        "Oh, Robert, you\u2019re horrible.  Simon, Maxine.  Who let you guys in here?",
        "He\u2019s blocking me.",
        "He put you right in front of me?",
        "It was all my fault.",
        "They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed.  They use a watch repair kit.",
        "Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven\u2019t been here for 12 Fridays.",
        "It\u2019s a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it\u2019s targets over the past quarter.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Ahh! Dwight!",
        "What? What is it?",
        "Dwight, that\u2019s awful.",
        "What do you mean by \u201cpoisoned\u201d?",
        "Ok, well I\u2019m very sorry about your aunt.",
        "But I don\u2019t see how this is my problem.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Gah.",
        "It\u2019s fine.",
        "Ugh! God, I can\u2019t. OK, I\u2019ll-",
        "I\u2019ll help you!",
        "Ugh.",
        "Hello Aunt Shirley.",
        "Oh, God.",
        "Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?",
        "Ow!",
        "No. No.",
        "No.",
        "Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.",
        "Spray her down?",
        "You have to use chains?",
        "Dwight!",
        "No! No!",
        "Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.",
        "No Dwight!",
        "No, Dwight!",
        "No Dwight, I won\u2019t-",
        "I\u2019m gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?",
        "Good.",
        "Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.",
        "I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.",
        "There.",
        "You\u2019re welcome. Would you like some stew?",
        "Mmhm.",
        "Is it any good?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.",
        "It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon.  Dwight, Dwight.",
        "No, Dwight. The Senator.",
        "I can\u2019t be your monkey, Dwight.",
        "I made a vow. I gave my word.",
        "Good night, D.",
        "Do they even have a bakery anymore?",
        "Kevin, you can do this.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "What, Pam?",
        "He\u2019s gone. It\u2019s just a cupcake now.",
        "Kevin?",
        "Some of us got both.",
        "No.",
        "Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?",
        "Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I\u2019m so glad you found someone. I bet she\u2019s got kind eyes.",
        "Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She\u2019s coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she\u2019ll be pulling the horse cart!",
        "Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.",
        "I bet she does.  I bet she\u2019ll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.",
        "Yes.",
        "I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that\u2026.thing.",
        "What about me? \u201cKlokken tre pige\u201d",
        "What? Why would they\u2026wait a second, wait a second! What was that?  Oh! I didn\u2019t know they were filming then!",
        "Oh my god.",
        "There was much more secret filming than I expected.  But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.",
        "Come on!",
        "Oscar.",
        "I think we need to figure out what\u2019s going on. I might just take a little walk.",
        "We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?",
        "Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?",
        "Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan!",
        "God!",
        "Oh!  Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.",
        "Call him!",
        "Call him!",
        "Call him! Call him!",
        "No you go. Hi honey!",
        "It\u2019s Angela and Oscar.",
        "Just a few quick things.",
        "Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn\u2019t tell you about it.",
        "I think we\u2019re good.",
        "Bye!",
        "Love you!  God.",
        "Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.",
        "All right, if I have to be the good wife, I\u2019ll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I\u2019m a better wife than that.",
        "",
        "",
        "Oh my god!",
        "Nellie you didn\u2019t tell us we could win money.",
        "Me? Oh, I\u2019m fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I\u2019m separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine  for me.. and Phillip\u2026 and Tinky\u2026 and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.",
        "Come here, come here. Let\u2019s go.",
        "I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn\u2019t take it. And if I went back now, when I\u2019m broke and he just inherited a farm, I\u2019d be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.",
        "Really?  Thank you.",
        "Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn\u2019t noticed.",
        "Come on Clark.",
        "No you can\u2019t baby!  Good luck.",
        "Whoo!",
        "Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it\u2019s your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.",
        "Yes!",
        "Thank you.  Oh god!",
        "Don\u2019t you dare tank this.",
        "Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.",
        "I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don\u2019t need pity and I don\u2019t need charity. I have my dignity and that\u2019s enough. And as long as I have that, I\u2019ll be ok.",
        "No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.",
        "Two sacks\u2019 worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.",
        "It\u2019s the  that lives downstairs. She\u2019s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.",
        "And they\u2019re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.",
        "I guess.",
        "Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.",
        "Yes. Congratulations.",
        "This is a big day for you.",
        "This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there\u2019s a problem it\u2019s clearly on your end. And\u2014oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then\u2026 um\u2026 what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn\u2019t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should\u2019ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting!",
        "Andy.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Yeah, okay. That\u2019s not what I mean. You don\u2019t have to leave because you said you would. Don\u2019t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It\u2019s not worth it.",
        "Ugh.",
        "No, that\u2019s not\u2014",
        "No, none\u2014No, stop. It\u2019s just\u2014",
        "Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.",
        "Thanks.",
        "It\u2019s just a really nice song.",
        "Well, I\u2019ve changed my mind.",
        "Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?",
        "Oh, god.",
        "You don\u2019t want me at your place.",
        "Well\u2026",
        "Thank you.",
        "Okay.",
        "Are you allowed to have pets?",
        "So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?",
        "I wouldn\u2019t know. I never lived with a gay guy.",
        "I love him.",
        "No, not the senator. I love Dwight.",
        "Ok, coming. Hi, baby.",
        "Daycare won\u2019t take Phillip anymore.",
        "Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won\u2019t forgive. So, hi.",

        "Okay. You wanna know?  I didn\u2019t call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.",
        "Do you honestly want to know why I didn\u2019t call her back on a date over four years ago?",
        "Okay. Honestly. I didn\u2019t call you back because I-thought you seemed a little\u2026 dorky."

        "Cool.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, I\u2019ll start.  It\u2019s pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I\u2019m scheduled to get one in six months, but I\u2019d like that to be moved up to now.",

        "Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.",
        "Okay, can you just stand right there?   I gotta send some e-mails.",
        "Well, it\u2019s simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we\u2019re shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I\u2019m pickin\u2019 up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin\u2019 a raise.",
        "What?  I can\u2019t hear you.",
        "I can\u2019t\u2014 what, Mike?  Are you\u2014",
        "Why can\u2019t I just\u2026 tell you?",
        "There you go.",
        "I am serious, Mike.  That\u2019s a 10% raise.  That\u2019s what I want.",
        "Come on, be for real Mike.",
        "Are you serious?  You\u2019re earning this?",
        "Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog.",
        "Ho-ho!",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.   Ah.",
        "Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.    Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.",
        "What?",
        "That\u2019s \u2019cause of you, Mike.  They\u2019re not gonna give the workin\u2019 man more than the boss.",
        "Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.",
        "Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put <i>you</i> in charge.  Okay, and we\u2019re shippin\u2019 more now than we ever have.",
        "Yeah that\u2019s true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.",
        "Yeah, you should.",
        "Fourteen years long.",
        "Make it happen, cap\u2019in.",
        "Comfortable, Mike?",
        "How about you, man.  Comfortable?",
        "Thank you.",
        "I haven\u2019t been to New York in a long time.",
        "Maybe I\u2019ll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.",
        "Oh you could stay too.  He\u2019s got a big place.",
        "Mm, it\u2019s not that big.",
        "Busses, though.  They get you home quick.",
        "Okay, bring it home now.  And don\u2019t forget the new black man phrase I taught you.",
        "Yes sir.  Remember that.  I\u2019ll be right outside if you need me",
        "Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I\u2026 just can\u2019t help myself.",
        "Now, this is the forklift.  You need\u2014  You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers <i>can\u2019t</i> drive it. \u2026 Quiz!  Mike.",
        "Should you drive the forklift?",
        "No! No no no no no!  I said <i>should</i> you.  You should not drive it.  You should not drive the forklift, you understand?",
        "It\u2019s not safe, you don\u2019t have a license.",
        "Her.  Yes, \u201cher\u201d is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?",
        "Do you understand that?",
        "We do safety training every year, or after an accident. \u2026 We\u2019ve never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled\u2026",
        "And I fell and busted my ankle.  I\u2019m legitimately scared for my workers.",
        "The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.",
        "How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?",
        "Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?",
        "Anybody?",
        "Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?",
        "You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful\u2026",
        "These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers, <i>Michael</i>, should not go anywhere near them.",
        "It\u2019s not a trash compactor!  It\u2019s a baler!",
        "No do not touch it!",
        "There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?",
        "Take them at the same time.",
        "Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.",
        "Actually, you did.",
        "Alright, we outta here.",
        "That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you, Mike.  It\u2019s serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin\u2019 on your biscuit.  Never havin\u2019 to risk it.",
        "Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you\u2019re gonna serious hurt yourself.",
        "Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.",
        "A lot\u2026 of things.  Uh, you, uh\u2026 What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It\u2019s goin\u2019 good, right?",
        "Mike, you\u2019re a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to <i>be</i> you.  To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well, you gotta be you.",
        "I couldn\u2019t do it. I\u2014 I ain\u2019t that strong.  And I ain\u2019t that brave.",
        "<i>Way</i> braver!  You Braveheart, man.",
        "Come down, okay?",
        "Summing up.",
        "You own a convertible. Come on man that\u2019s, that\u2019s hot. Women love that stuff right?",
        "Presbyterian.",
        "Oh?",

        "Here you go.",
        "So you still missing Ryan?",
        "Mmmmm.",
        "There\u2019s information here? Yeah, you\u2019re right, I don\u2019t need this.",

        "It\u2019s like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It\u2019s gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.",
        "Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what\u2019s not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing\u2019s run its course.",

        "Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said \u201cDarryl, just wait. He\u2019s a fool. There\u2019s gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.\u201d",
        "Close the door.",
        "I don\u2019t have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It\u2019s like jazz.  Andy don\u2019t mess with me.  I\u2019ll figure something out.",
        "Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.",

        "Probably shouldn\u2019t tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so\u2026 we have a place.",

        "Lightbulb\u2019s burnt out, so it\u2019s dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I\u2019m trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn\u2019t exist, okay?",
        "Pam.",
        "Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.",

        "No.",
        "All right, this is just messed up.",
        "All right.",

        "It says decaf. You get me decaf?",
        "My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He\u2019s only been here for a week, and I hate him.",
        "He\u2019s got to go, Mike.",

        "No, it\u2019s my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It\u2019s his first play. He didn\u2019t even audition.",

        "How would you like it if we booed you?",
        "Boo! Boo!",
        "Boo! Boo!",
        "Andy, sing us another song.",
        "I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t regret having their child, let\u2019s move it to the pros.",
        "Condoms.",
        "Ohh. Ok. I didn\u2019t realize we were doing trick questions. What\u2019s the safest way to go skiing? Don\u2019t ski!",
        "We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?",
        "I don\u2019t know who\u2019s got you upset but my advice is stop crying.",
        "Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It\u2019s all about heart, and character. Be your best self.",
        "Yeah.",

        "How much?",
        "That\u2019s crazy money. I\u2019ll take forty.",
        "One second, one second, one second.  So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?",
        "But you\u2019re singing it.",
        "No, that\u2019s not a good idea. I don\u2019t see that as a very good song.",
        "Oh, I never sing with soul.",
        "Song\u2019s about truth.",
        "What\u2019s something you really care about?",
        "More universal.",

        "What\u2019s under your shirt?",
        "Hello?",
        "I\u2019m good.",

        "Let me put my shoes on.",
        "I\u2019m not mad. Are you mad?",
        "Well, I\u2019m sorry if it seems that way to you.",
        "Mike.",
        "You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I\u2019m not apologizing.",
        "That\u2019s it.",
        "Yes.",
        "No.",
        "You\u2019re gonna be missing out on some good ideas.",
        "You said no to this one!",
        "What have you done for me?",
        "What have you done for me?",
        "Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you\u2019ve ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.",
        "I don\u2019t understand the point of a hat.",
        "Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.",
        "Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?",
        "This was your freshman year.",

        "Hey Andy.",
        "You gotta stop texting me so much.",
        "You need to change your standard for what\u2019s worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.",
        "No.",
        "There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they\u2019d all say the same thing. \u201cI\u2019m coming over baby.\u201d And I would text back \u201cBTB\u201d, bring that booty.",

        "I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It\u2019s my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I\u2019ve never heard of. iCarly\u2026 You know who\u2019s funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He\u2019s got a nice way of talking.",
        "Come on, now, Justine, look\u2026 Listen, look, I\u2019ve been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.",

        "Jada don\u2019t want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn\u2019t as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.",
        "Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that\u2019s something to do.",
        "How do I do that?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "No, he doesn\u2019t.  I told her Santa would be here.",
        "Sure, sweetie.",
        "Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!",
        "Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he\u2019ll tell us if we\u2019re hot or cold.",
        "And the game\u2019s over seconds later.",
        "What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies\u2026",
        "Hey, Mike.",
        "We wanted to give you something.",

        "You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There\u2019s tons of cuties and it\u2019s easy to talk to them. \u2018Hey, what book is that? Cool, let\u2019s hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa\u2026\u2019",
        "I\u2019ll come with you, show you how it\u2019s done.",
        "My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&amp;J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.",
        "I got that cutie behind the counter.",
        "Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.",
        "Holy , what? Let me see that. It\u2019s so light. Like a croissant.",
        "Hey, how\u2019d you do?",
        "Really?",
        "Cool.",

        "Guys, guys. That\u2019s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.",
        "Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?",
        "I\u2019ll put you down for shortbreads.",
        "No. No.",
        "I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.",
        "You know what? It\u2019s your first time, let\u2019s split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll just take, uh, accounting.",
        "OK, great.",
        "All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some.  When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.",
        "Would you like to buy some cookies?",
        "It\u2019s not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.",
        "You\u2019re new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.",
        "That doesn\u2019t mean anything.  Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?",
        "Huh. Hit the road, jack.",
        "What\u2019s a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can\u2019t trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my  chubby daughter?",
        "Baby, if you're watching this, you\u2019re not chubby, you\u2019re beautiful. Daddy\u2019s just got to sell some cookies. And we\u2019re also gonna exercise more. It\u2019s gonna be fun.",
        "No, no, no, no. It\u2019s not worth it.",
        "Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?",
        "You\u2019re not talking\u2026 triple digits?",
        "Hi. This is Alex.",
        "Kevin can\u2019t come to the phone right now because he\u2019s busy with us.",
        "I don\u2019t know, man, they might think we\u2019re drag queens.",
        "Forget it, man.",
        "I\u2019m out. And so is Toby.",
        "This may be wrong. But there\u2019s a limit to what I would do for my child.",
        "Hey, hey. They\u2019re back.",
        "I was still thinking of going back to school.",
        "Me.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.",
        "So how was the drive in?",
        "You don\u2019t say?",
        "Phyllis. This rain\u2026 does it make you wanna be doing something?",
        "Uh\u2026 I have other issues. I\u2019m terrible at math. Overweight. You- you\u2019re in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.",
        "He does not like that wall.",
        "Looking good, RC!",
        "You really re-did Andy\u2019s office, huh?",
        "I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.",
        "You could go downstairs and ask them?",
        "Who knew, right?",
        "Tacos.",
        "I can go get us some tacos.",
        "If you loan me some money.",
        "$30.",
        "Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!",
        "Hmhmm.",
        "She\u2019s trying.",
        "Pepper\u2019s been getting me out of the house, going on runs.",
        "Is she sick? How are her poops?",
        "Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.",
        "You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?",
        "And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.",
        "Aw, come on. What\u2019s the harm?  Mmm. What flavor was that?",
        "The coconut\u2019s pretty subtle.",
        "I don\u2019t know, man. Y\u2019all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y\u2019all came up in here dancing and everybody was-  ooh, hold on a second.  Oh.",
        "If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn\u2019t give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.",
        "A lot has changed since y\u2019all left, okay? You\u2019re gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she\u2019s one of the best we\u2019ve ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?",
        "I would.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes, I am. Just so everyone\u2019s on the same page.",
        "Good slam.",
        "Good luck to you.",
        "Let\u2019s see that smile. Go on.",
        "Cool.",
        "Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.",
        "This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.",
        "Go, Dwight Jr!",
        "Congratulations, baby!",
        "You got this, Roy.",
        "Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin\u2019s confidence.",
        "Andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I\u2019d be into The Godfather \u2019cause I\u2019m black. Wrong! I\u2019m into The Godfather \u2019cause I\u2019m a cinephile. I like Scarface \u2019cause I\u2019m black.",
        "OK, um, I like Erin\u2019s hair. It\u2019s a very pretty color.",
        "Um, where did you get that story?",
        "That was a good one.",
        "It\u2019s getting late. I thought you guys could use a little  inspiration.",
        "127 hours. It\u2019s about this guy who-",
        "My bad.",
        "Goodnight.",
        "Oh, ok.",
        "It\u2019s all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!",
        "Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I\u2019ve been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let\u2019s knock out a few more of these sound bites while we\u2019re here.  Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.",
        "You log in sales at ten different times. If you log \u2018em all at once, you save a lot of time. It\u2019s called batching.",
        "Life hacking, man.",
        "Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.",
        "What?! Really?",
        "Huh ha! That\u2019s cool, man.",
        "Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.",
        "Yes, yes, yes.",
        "I included some time saving ideas\u2026",
        "Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn\u2019t be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.",
        "You\u2019re gonna po\u2019 mouth",
        "Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions\u2014",
        "That could work.",
        "I\u2019m going for a walk.",
        "I\u2019m done. I gotta get out of here.",
        "It\u2019s not just today, it\u2019s everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.",
        "Hmm. Yeah right",
        "Like what?",
        "What kind of job?",
        "Hell yeah!",
        "That sounds awesome!",
        "I love Philly!",
        "It\u2019s not even a thought\u2014",
        "What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?",
        "Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man!  And Pam\u2019s into it?",
        "Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.",
        "It\u2019s not real\u2026 until your wife is on board.",
        "Yeah. You too, huh?",
        "Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too.   Yeah.",
        "That was a triple.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "Hey, if you don\u2019t want to teach me Power Point, just say so.",
        "Come on! Just show me the Power Point.",
        "You\u2019re the tutorial.",
        "You could be.",

        "You popped one kernel.",
        "Correct.",
        "Stop.",
        "Too late.",
        "You went to Cornell?",
        "I can't really picture it. Can you\u2026 get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.",
        "Get under your chin first. Yeah.",
        "Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.",
        "Yeah, that's crazy.",

        "Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?",
        "What are y\u2019all doing?",
        "Cool. It should be taller though, right?",
        "That\u2019s what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about.",
        "Bang.",
        "Well, yeah, what can I say, a player\u2019s gotta play.",
        "Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I\u2019m gonna let them think the other thing.",
        "Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.",
        "So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?",
        "Think that through for a sec.",
        "Yeah, Jim\u2019s going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven\u2019t heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?",
        "What else could you possibly be forgetting?",
        "Things? People?",
        "Jim, that guy.  You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy\u2026what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy?  It\u2019s awful.",
        "Meredith\u2019s a little cute. I\u2019m just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.",
        "Boo!",
        "I\u2019m gonna tell Jim to go  himself.",
        "Back for more, huh?",
        "You!",
        "That\u2019s great.",
        "Thanks, man.",
        "I shall come by at your convenience.",
        "Whoo!",
        "Oh! Whoa!",

        "Me and Val were going nowhere and if I\u2019m gonna be working in Philly, I\u2019m gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here\u2019s how you do it. You say, \u201cWhat are you gonna do, breakup with me?\u201d Like it\u2019s a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.",
        "I\u2019ll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.",
        "Alright, we\u2019re going down to my warehouse, that means we\u2019re playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.",
        "Yeah, she ended things.",

        "Oh, hey Val.",
        "Yeah.",
        "When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn\u2019t feeling good. She\u2019s not around to do that anymore. I\u2019m sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.",
        "Huh?",

        "Why don\u2019t you come along and tell him yourself?",
        "I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy\u2019s job in the bag until my interview.",
        "Yeah, I guess\u2026",
        "Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!",

        "Yeah, we did it.",
        "Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.",

        "What up?",

        "I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.",

        "Yep. Take care.",
        "Hey.",

        "Wow. Man. I hope he doesn\u2019t regret it.",

        "Oh, oh, I\u2019m sure we did.",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that\u2019s on me. But I\u2019m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you\u2019re feeling sentimental.",
        "Hey, hey, hey. I\u2019ll do one thing with y\u2019all.",

        "You chose one thing?",
        "You want to dance?",
        "This is what you want?",
        "Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we\u2019re gonna do this right.",
        "I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I\u2019m gonna miss these guys.",
        "Hello, hello.",
        "Hey, what\u2019s up?",
        "What? Must\u2019ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.",
        "Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um\u2026I didn\u2019t call \u2018cause I figured you changed the number.",
        "Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.",
        "You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?",

You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you\u2019re visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to\u2014",

        "Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers.  Look, you\u2019re not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing\u2026 is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.",
        "Here\u2019s the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It\u2019s not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It\u2019s Hail Mary time.",
        "What say we do.",

        "Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor . There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.",
        "There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can\u2019t get a report on it because it\u2019s not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.",
        "I\u2019ll fax over some of the things we\u2019re looking for.",
        "Look, this is important, Michael.",

        "Fine. What is going on?",
        "Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We\u2019re going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?",
        "How could you not know Michael?",
        "Might have hi\u2014 OK, what firm?",
        "Michael?",
        "Was it the sales department?",
        "Was it Jim?",
        "OK, was it Dwight?",
        "That\u2019s too bad.",
        "Hopefully, nothing that can\u2019t be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight.",
        "I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute?",
        "Alright Dwight. This is huge.",
        "This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.",
        "Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?",
        "Yeah?",
        "You probably have too much to do around here. I don\u2019t want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.",
        "Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.",
        "No. No dogs.",
        "We are gonna call you back guys.  What is going on here?",
        "No, no.",
        "Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?",
        "What, I don\u2019t \u2014 what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?",
        "OK, uhh\u2026 I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don\u2019t send me those notes.",
        "I am gone.",
        "A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I\u2019m sure.",

        "Uh.",
        "You know, I just want to address everyone first.",
        "Hi, everyone.",
        "Hi.  Uh, look it\u2019s no secret\u2013",
        "Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I\u2019m here\u2013 I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.",
        "Okay?",
        "I\u2019ve been wondering that myself lately.  We\u2019re just gonna get started, we\u2019re gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?",
        "Hmm.",
        "I find that extraordinarily surprising.",
        "We\u2019ll bring them both in.",
        "Fellas, why don\u2019t we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to say this, but the cheapest option\u2026 is to make Michael an offer.",
        "Jim, you\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re pretty close with him.  You think they\u2019d be up for hearing an offer?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.",
        "$12,000.",
        "Here\u2019s the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can\u2019t be making very much money.  I don\u2019t know how your prices are so low, but I know it can\u2019t keep up that way.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019re scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you\u2019re gonna get.",
        "Okay, now I don\u2019t know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How\u2019s about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?",
        "Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.",
        "So you\u2019ve thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.",
        "No.",
        "Uh, you already have a new receptionist\u2013",

        "Do you realize what you\u2019re asking for here?  You\u2019re talking about salary plus health benefits\u2013",
        "Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You\u2019re talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.",
        "Your company cannot be worth that much.",
        "Michael\u2013",
        "Okay.  Deal.  Okay?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Nicely done. We\u2019re still going to crush you though!",
        "Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.",
        "Okay, introducing Scranton\u2019s Michael Scott performing with Nashua\u2019s Holly Flax! I have not seen this.",
        "Uh, okay everyone, we\u2019re at a picnic today\u2026",
        "I\u2019m sorry, this certainly wasn\u2019t the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.",
        "We\u2019re- we\u2019re closing the Buffalo branch.",
        "How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?",
        "What about the fact that they\u2019re here today? What about that? That didn\u2019t throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, \u201coh, this would be really funny.\u201d",
        "Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, \u201cis my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?\u201d",
        "Yeah.",
        "Dwight, come on now, it\u2019s time to put in the subs.",
        "Dwight.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, I will look at it Monday.",
        "Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?",
        "No, ah it\u2019s okay Michael.  We got it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don\u2019t mind.",
        "Cheese platter?",
        "Alright, well I should go.  Thanks for this.  You\u2019ve given me a lot to think about.  Please promise me you won\u2019t do anything until we speak.",
        "Thank you Jim.",
        "Erin, is Michael around?",
        "Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?",
        "Are you sure you\u2019re okay with these new responsibilites?",
        "I\u2019m just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone\u2019s talents.",
        "What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?",
        "Please do.",
        "I thought you liked Jim?",
        "Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?",
        "Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "Ummm\u2026 okay, here\u2019s the thing though.  The plan doesn\u2019t work unless we have someone to replace you.  I was hoping\u2026 plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer.  We may have to replace him.",
        "Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.",
        "This is David.",
        "Yep.",
        "So, what, you\u2019re changing your mind about Jim?",
        "Michael, it seems like you\u2019re cutting in and out\u2026 This is not what you said earlier.",
        "Well, it doesn\u2019t change what you showed me in Jim\u2019s file.",
        "Michael, I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on  down there, but\u2026 oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.",
        "Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?",
        "Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.",
        "Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyone\u2019s on board.",
        "We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton.  Both of you guys working as co-managers.  Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.",
        "Co-manager and Co-manager.  See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.",
        "Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.   Okay look, I\u2019m not going to force you into anything.  If you\u2019re willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we\u2019ll find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?",
        "Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late.  Things are still a bit unclear, we didn\u2019t officially decide anything yet.",
        "But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it\u2019s not good.  We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year.  Insolvent.  So, well\u2026 You know what?  I\u2019m sorry, I have to run.  But we will talk soon, OK?",
        "You know what? I can\u2019t really get my head around anything like that right now, but that\u2019s great.  Keep after it, but I gotta run.",
        "Thanks Jim.",
        "Michael.",
        "So glad you could make it.",
        "How was the ride?",
        "I\u2019m glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we\u2019ll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.",
        "Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O\u2019Keefe.",
        "It was fun when we weren\u2019t on the brink of bankruptcy.",
        "Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.",
        "What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You\u2019ve dug us quite a hole.",
        "There is no plan.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "No. No. No. No. No. No. Don\u2019t call anybody, Michael.",
        "Please do not text anybody, now, Michael.",
        "Yes.",
        "Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?",
        "Am I missing something?",
        "Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier.  If you can\u2019t do that, we\u2019re going to have a separate discussion.",
        "Uh, hey, I\u2019m sorry.  I\u2019m taking this out on you.",
        "It\u2019s been crazy here.  You know I think you\u2019re doing a great job, right?",
        "Okay.  Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yes Michael, what is so urgent?",
        "I\u2019m not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.",
        "Michael\u2026",
        "Michael-",
        "This is a very very bad time.",
        "Stephanie, can you hop off please?",
        "Listen, I shouldn\u2019t tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.",
        "I\u2019ll be fired.",
        "Alan will be out too. All of us.",
        "Goodbye Michael.",

        "Ever, ever\u2026",
        "Hello everyone.",
        "You weren\u2019t supposed to tell anyone Michael.",
        "I am not supposed to\u2026 Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don\u2019t know.",
        "Look. They\u2019re buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works.  So congratulations.",
        "No! No, and congratulations.",
        "Michael.",
        "No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.",
        "You look great.",
        "You hungry? I\u2019m just having lunch.",

        "I have a doctor\u2019s appointment next Thursday.",
        "Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.",
        "No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.",
        "Uh, but maybe, uh \u2013 actually, you know, I think maybe we\u2019ll go outside. May -maybe we\u2019ll go outside.  Outside.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I mean, what can you do?",
        "I, I \u2013 It\u2019s a tough one.",
        "I don\u2019t have any ideas for you there.",
        "Hey, oh, okay. Wait.",
        "I want to tell you about a business idea I have.",
        "Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It\u2019s like a shop-vac type of thing.  Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks.  Picks it up!",
        "No. No, no, no. That\u2019s the -that\u2019s the vacuum noise.",
        "You-you don\u2019t like it.",
        "No, it\u2019s ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he\u2019s gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh\u2026 It\u2019s like shop-vac.  Did I say that?",
        "It\u2019ll be ok.",
        "Hey, you know, if you want, I\u2019m sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.",
        "Suck it. That\u2019s what it\u2019s called.",
        "Huh? Catchy. Kids\u2019ll love it.",
        "Oh, Michael.",
        "Thank you for coming.",
        "Well, it\u2019s a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You\u2019re going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we\u2019ll\u2026",

        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah! Teddy!",
        "What you doing?",
        "You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.",
        "Yeah big time, yeah.",
        "Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?",
        "Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He\u2019s called Ho Li .  That\u2019s what it sounds like.",
        "Herrow! Herrow!",
        "You can\u2019t do that these days. You can\u2019t.",
        "No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That\u2019s what she said. .  Ohh.",
        "Where are you working?",
        "Any jobs now?",

        "All right.",
        "Andy Bernard!",
        "How you doing, I\u2019m great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.",
        "That\u2019s the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.",
        "Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!",
        "Andy Bernard.",
        "Um\u2026 I\u2019m in the middle of a piano lesson.",
        "Dunder Mifflin.  Now\u2026 why would I want that? It\u2019s worth half of what it was three years ago.",
        "Why don\u2019t you come in?",
        "Hey guys, long time.",
        "Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I\u2019ve been talking with Andy-",
        "I\u2019ll get to that in a second, Andy.",
        "Yes, as we\u2019ve discussed-",

        "Well, okay. Great to meet you.",
        "Pleasure.",

Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, \u201cThe kind that\u2019s good for head shots.\u201d And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it\u2019s gonna boost office morale. Now, he\u2019s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.",

        "Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.",
        "Dwight Schrute.",
        "Well\u2026",
        "He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.",
        "That\u2019s not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?",
        "Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your\u2026",
        "Michael. Michael?",
        "I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.",
        "I\u2019m now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.",
        "You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.",
        "I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?",
        "OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I\u2019ll make sure that\u2019s covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?",
        "Yeah, but no one here has it.",
        "I most certainly did not.",
        "Oh, um\u2026 Jan wants you to call her.",
        "You came into my office voluntarily.",
        "Well, maybe they won\u2019t get slashed if you answer all my questions.",
        "Psssh, no.",
        "Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? \u2018Cause that guy couldn\u2019t get sick, just like me.",
        "Unlikely.",
        "100%.",
        "I don\u2019t think so, no.",
        "Wrong.  Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley.  Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?",
        "That was\u2026 unauthorized.",
        "Why don\u2019t you just go ahead and use Roy\u2019s health care plan, huh?",
        "But you\u2019re engaged. Aren\u2019t you and maybe you\u2019ve set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you\u2019re going to get married you don\u2019t have to take our health care plan seriously.",
        "You really expect me to believe you haven\u2019t set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you\u2019ve been engaged for three years and I know you\u2019ve set a date. And you know what else, I know you\u2019ve got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.",
        "You wrote down\u2026 I didn\u2019t give you permission to.. I didn\u2019t\u2026",
        "You\u2019re doing the right thing. Go ahead. What \u2018s your confession?",
        "Let it out.",
        "Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We\u2019ll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn\u2019t you?",
        "I know you did.",
        "Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.",
        "You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.",
        "I, Jim Halpert\u2026",
        "\u2026confess to health care fraud.",
        "One word.",
        "Michael!?",
        "I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?",
        "I, but if there were, I\u2019d be protected as assistant regional manager?",
        "Yeah, so I don\u2019t have to worry?",
        "Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?",
        "It\u2019s a real shame, \u2019cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.",
        "I didn\u2019t do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for\u2026 maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What\u2019s the scuttlebutt?",
        "Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. \u2018Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.",
        "Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?",
        "Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who\u2019s vulnerable and who\u2019s protected\u2026",
        "Did you get your tickets?",
        "The gun show.",
        "There\u2019s one other thing and this is important. Let\u2019s keep this alliance totally a secret. Don\u2019t tell anyone.",
        "Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the\u2026 paper products?",
        "Did you tell Pam about the alliance?",
        "Just now.",
        "Right, that\u2019s good, good, pursue this.",
        "Mmm hmm.",
        "Done.",
        "They seem awfully chummy, don\u2019t you think?",
        "Only one way to find out.",
        "What? I believe it.",
        "I could tell, from the body language.",
        "Good, let \u2019em. It helps our cause.",
        "Oh, they\u2019re forming an alliance",
        "Damn it. God!",
        "God\u2026 Damn it! Why us?",
        "Jackpot.",
        "Hey, you wanted to see me?",
        "I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be missed.",
        "Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.",
        "She had a hysterectomy.",
        "That\u2019s where they remove the uterus.",
        "It could be kind of funny.",
        "Oh my God, we have to be there.",
        "No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.",
        "I know. I know exactly what to do.",
        "I\u2019m a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are\u2026 at vision.",
        "This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.",
        "So tape it down.",
        "Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I\u2019ll poke holes in the box.",
        "No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don\u2019t notice we\u2019re both gone.",
        "Can I trust Jim? I don\u2019t know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don\u2019t. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.",
        "Oh.",
        "I have absolutely no idea.",
        "Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That\u2019s the game. Convince him we\u2019re in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.",
        "That\u2019s politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.",
        "Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that.  But no one can become me.",
        "Not true. And if they did, they couldn\u2019t because I\u2019m password protected.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "It was rotting.",
        "Any employee may dispose a food item\u2026",
        "\u2026that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.",
        "Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.",
        "Uh, if they don\u2019t bobble, what\u2019s the point?",
        "God\u2026 Damn it! Why us?",
        "Okay.",
        "I\u2019ll stay for ten.",
        "Hey.",
        "You wanted to see me?",
        "I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be missed.",
        "Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.",
        "She had a hysterectomy.",
        "That\u2019s where they remove the uterus.",
        "It could be kind of funny.",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "Okay. Hey Meredith, where\u2019s your uterus?",
        "If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity?",
        "From the downsizing.",
        "Well played.",
        "Michael!",
        "Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.",
        "Oh, please.",
        "I apologized for that.",
        "Michael, I\u2026",
        "I can handle that.",
        "And that\u2019s why you have an assistant regional manager.",
        "Same thing.",
        "It\u2019s close.",
        "So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be\u2026Jim.",
        "Gimli.",
        "Just trying to be helpful.",
        "Michael, look.",
        "Yes!",
        "Can I be team captain?",
        "Can I be team manager?",
        "Assistant team manager?",
        "OK, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s working this weekend then.",
        "OK, we\u2019ll be skins!",
        "What? Shirts on or off?",
        "You sure?",
        "De-fense!   De-fense!",
        "Yeah!  In your face!",
        "Yes!",
        "Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag.",
        "Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?",
        "In your office?  You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.",
        "Same thing.",
        "It\u2019s close.",
        "What?",
        "What look?",
        "Please, have a seat.  Okay, why not?",
        "Marching or garage?",
        "I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I\u2019ll get back to you. That is all.",
        "Would you like to have a vacation this year? That\u2019s what I thought.  Mmm, delicious.",
        "Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy.",
        "On one condition. You\u2026",
        "Oh, no it\u2019s not. Okay, check it out.",
        "No, you\u2019re not because I spent hours on it.",
        "Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You\u2019ll be back.",
        "Isn\u2019t that crazy? I\u2019m a Volunteer Sheriff\u2019s Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it\u2019s okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren\u2019t qualified enough for his perfect little face. It\u2019s nuts.",
        "I\u2019ve almost had my nose broken a dozen times.",
        "Yes!",
        "Sex.",
        "Torture.",
        "Cocks in the henhouse.",
        "So am I.",
        "Doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.",
        "Hmmm\u2026 she\u2019s been talking to Michael a lot.",
        "Assistant to the Regional Manager.",
        "That\u2019s true.",
        "True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "I don\u2019t want a purse. Purses are for girls.",
        "No.",
        "Like those?",
        "Okay, I\u2019m just going to use the bathroom, and then I\u2019m going\u2026",
        "It\u2019s actually better this way.",
        "Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it\u2019s against the rules and everything. Because\u2026",
        "Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.",
        "What?",
        "Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?",
        "Please. Please, I am your inferior and I\u2019m asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?",
        "You cannot promise me, or you won\u2019t promise me?",
        "Do you love her?",
        "Hey, how\u2019s it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?",
        "It will just take a second.",
        "Just for a minute.",
        "Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.",
        "Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?",
        "I knew it. Is it waterproof?",
        "Snakes are waterproof. So, I\u2019m betting that it\u2019s waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?",
        "\u2018Cause I could look it up real easily.",
        "My belt\u2019s made out of alligator. Check it out.",
        "I was just showing her my belt.",
        "I\u2026.",
        "Not all the time.",
        "I think it did.",
        "Seriously?",
        "What else?",
        "It\u2019s a mini-briefcase.",
        "It\u2019s in my purse.",
        "Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.",
        "So, what\u2019s the joke? You\u2019re not perfect either.",
        "So who are we laughing at?",
        "Who? Dave Barry?",
        "What is it? Who wrote it?",
        "That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you\u2019ll be punished less.",
        "No, no, no, no\u2026",
        "\u2026no, no, no, no, it\u2019s not what you think.",
        "No, why were you in there?!",
        "What were you doing in there?",
        "I am not.",
        "Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.",
        "We are going to have two men\u2019s rooms.",
        "Be prepared to hold folks  From 9 am to\u2026",
        "Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions\u2026",
        "\u2026for people\u2019s behavior.",
        "And it\u2019s-",
        "Yes!",
        "Best Dundies ever.",
        "Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.",
        "Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I\u2019m not afraid to use it.  Devon!",
        "The waitress tripped on the cord.",
        "Really? We don\u2019t have any girls from HR.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Like an AIDS test?",
        "Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m a sheriff\u2019s deputy.",
        "Don\u2019t get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-",
        "It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m going to use my shirt.",
        "Ahh! I can\u2019t-",
        "Watch your step.",
        "Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn\u2019t a concussion.",
        "Michael, I need to talk to you.",
        "I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies\u2019 room wall.",
        "Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.",
        "Michael.",
        "Michael.",
        "By any means necessary?",
        "It\u2019s the ladies\u2019 room.",
        "Angela, it\u2019s simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.",
        "I\u2019m not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what\u2019s written about Michael.",
        "Okay, I\u2019ll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?",
        "No, no, no.",
        "It\u2019s not what you think.",
        "I\u2019m on official business.",
        "This is Dunder Mifflin\u2026",
        "No. Phyllis, you\u2019re not\u2026",
        "Phyllis, no. No.",
        "Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She\u2019s out of her mind.",
        "That is not true.",
        "That\u2019s totally unfair. I was just in the ladies\u2019 room in order to spy.",
        "What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, \u201cOh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.\u201d I\u2019m not even attracted to you.",
        "Yeah, you know me.",
        "The Dundies!",
        "You know me.",
        "Yeah, you know me.",
        "No, no. No margarita. Hot sake.",
        "Fosters in the big can.",
        "Just a chocolate shake, chocolate sprinkles.",
        "Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.",
        "I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Jim, don\u2019t interfere.",
        "Can you give me a second, sir.",
        "I am a Sheriff\u2019s Deputy.",
        "I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.",
        "Pam, are you all right?",
        "How many fingers am I holding up?",
        "All right. Are you okay?",
        "I will. I will. You need to calm down.",
        "So the monkey does the sex thing right here!",
        "Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?",
        "Consider it?",
        "Yes!",
        "Yeah, Meredith.",
        "Yes.",
        "Hey, Toby.",
        "You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.",
        "Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?",
        "Good. Good. And\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "Diversifying. Smart.",
        "And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People\u2019d obey the law, there\u2019d be less troublemakers.",
        "You should go.",
        "Uh huh.",
        "You have your lawyer there?",
        "Can I be your representative?",
        "I think I should be there.",
        "I\u2019m good. I can make sure things are up to code.",
        "Please, I\u2019m always the guy you rely on at work.",
        "So you\u2019re taking a personal day?",
        "Please, I\u2019ll make you proud.",
        "Yes! As your representative?",
        "Same thing.",
        "I have been Michael\u2019s #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We\u2019re like one of those classic famous teams.

        "Which one\u2019s yours?",
        "This is smaller than your old place.",
        "Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It\u2019s a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.",
        "Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.",
        "Let\u2019s go check out the master bedroom.",
        "Oh. Terrible idea.",
        "No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.",
        "Warrantees don\u2019t cover it, plus they\u2019re a rip-off.",
        "Shh Shh.",
        "Listen.  Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.",
        "What kind of mortgage did you get?",
        "Ho, thirty years.",
        "Wow, you\u2019ll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.",
        "Forget about retiring when you\u2019re 65. Hey, I\u2019ve got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that\u2019s where the nurse can live.",
        "Well, this is it.",
        "Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.",
        "We\u2019ll be here waiting for you.",
        "A thirty year mortgage at Michael\u2019s age essentially means that he\u2019s buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn\u2019t hear the other dead people.",
        "Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today?",

When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.

In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don\u2019t trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he\u2019s the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She\u2019s been waiting for me all these years; she\u2019s never taken another lover.  I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t show up. I go to Berlin.  That\u2019s where I stashed the chandelier.",

        "Oh, no. No. No. No. No.",
        "Michael! Michael!",
        "Don\u2019t let him in! He\u2019s a traitor! Michael!",
        "Are you saying you invented paper?",
        "It\u2019s not the soil! It\u2019s the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah!",
        "Spin move.",
        "Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.",
        "I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.",
        "La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!",
        "Come on.",
        "What he\u2019s not telling you is that he will abandon you.",
        "Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how\u2019s your gay son?",
        "How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?",
        "Shame, Jim.  I expected more.",
        "It\u2019s not your fault. Some people just don\u2019t want to be inspired.",
        "Been there, done that.",
        "David Wallace! Hello, we\u2019ve been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.",
        "Come along, afterthought.",
        "Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.",
        "I say we fill Michael\u2019s office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.",
        "No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist.",
        "Five minutes exactly.",
        "Sure thing.",
        "Idiot, we\u2019re starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.",
        "Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say\u2013 can I say something?",
        "There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.",
        "Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That\u2019s how you really apply the pressure.",
        "You know what?  Why don\u2019t I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I\u2019m the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?",
        "Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you\u2019re leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.    Charles.",
        "May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.",
        "They\u2019ve been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They\u2019re desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They\u2019re total failures.",
        "Quiet you.",
        "You don\u2019t crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That\u2019s like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I\u2019ve solved plenty.",
        "I\u2019m gonna answer Charles first.",
        "Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.",
        "Done.",
        "I\u2019m not\u2013 I\u2019m not following you.",
        "Wh\u2013",
        "Wh\u2013what are you doing?",
        "Wait, what?",
        "Yeah , aren\u2019t we getting those clients back?",
        "You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.",
        "Fresh hot ink.",
        "Trust me, Stanley,  you\u2019re going to want to read this memo very carefully.",
        "No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.",
        "When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.",
        "Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?",
        "Did you even read the memo?",
        "No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.",
        "Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.",
        "We\u2019re in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I\u2019m not convinced that Michael and Pam didn\u2019t have a thing going while they were gone.",
        "No, you\u2019re too close.",
        "Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?",
        "He doesn\u2019t like it.",
        "Her face is okay, but\u2013 Jesus!  What \u2013what are you doing here?",
        "Get out!  We need to do something.  I\u2019m thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.",
        "No, I\u2019m not saying we do those things.  I\u2019m saying something like those things.",
        "Excellent question.",
        "Words will never be enough.",
        "No, pictures are too interpretive.",
        "Oh.  Well, that\u2013that\u2019s a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we\u2019ll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I\u2019ll see everyone upstairs.",
        "C\u2019mon.   Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I\u2019m talking action\u2013",
        "Lunch.",
        "It\u2019s pony.",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.",
        "That\u2019s my client.",
        "Give me the phone.",
        "Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.",
        "Hi, Mr. Bart.",
        "Hey, it\u2019s Dwight here.  Give me the phone.",
        "Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, don\u2019t hang up.",
        "I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness.  Ryan!",
        "Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!",
        "You\u2019re a secretary! What do you know?",
        "And you\u2019re a temp and I\u2019m taking your phone.   I\u2019m confiscating this.",
        "We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.",
        "No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We\u2019ll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance\u2026Stanley Paper Company.",
        "Right.",
        "Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?",
        "I don\u2019t know that first things about secret meetings.",
        "I\u2019ll do\u2013",
        "I\u2019ll do the best I can.",
        "Deceit does not come easy to me.",
        "That\u2019s fair.",
        "Listen up, Flenderson.  You\u2019re being weak and ineffectual.  I\u2019m cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.",
        "No.",
        "That\u2019s debatable.",
        "Shut up.",
        "I got her!",
        "I do.",
        "Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.",
        "Now, how can I help you?",
        "Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court \u2013",
        "It is a big deal. Cause there\u2019s only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner\u2019s permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.",
        "No.",
        "All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.",
        "Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who\u2019s Phillip?",
        "Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?",
        "Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.",
        "What do you think history is?",
        "Out of the way! Move it or lose it!",
        "You want to get sick you go to the hospital.",
        "I\u2019m gonna need two able bodied men.",
        "You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?",
        "Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn\u2019t doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?",
        "No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It\u2019s the most annoying thing.  It\u2019s like children singing Christmas carols.",
        "Tell me where it hurts.",
        "Oh yeah. you\u2019ve got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.",
        "This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.",
        "Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.",
        "I\u2019m gonna with the python.",
        "No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.",
        "What\u2019s so funny?",
        "Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.",
        "You can\u2019t steal what is legally your property.",
        "It is hard to imagine you playing softball.",
        "Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.",
        "I played high school softball. Notice I didn\u2019t say \u201cgirls\u201d high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.",
        "Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you\u2019re there say \u201cHi\u201d to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he\u2019s a cheat and a ball hog. And if he\u2019s still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. \u2018Cause she\u2019s a heart breaking tart\u2026and a ball hog.",
        "What do you need from me?",
        "Normally I don\u2019t condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don\u2019t know.  No, I\u2019m kidding. He\u2019s just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.",
        "Like clockwork.",
        "Bye Michael!  Yeah!",
        "I\u2019m gonna say 30.",
        "Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.",
        "Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET?",
        "Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.",
        "Listen up everyone! I\u2019ve gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim\u2019s whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?",
        "Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!",
        "Why? I don\u2019t understand.",
        "Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.",
        "I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019m gonna do you one better. I\u2019m gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.",
        "Sly dog.",

        "Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!",
        "I could\u2019ve gotten that, idiot!",
        "It\u2019s not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let\u2019s focus! Come on, you\u2019re better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!",
        "",
        "Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand\u2019s on the net.",
        "Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you\u2019re right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?",
        "Yes! We advance to the next round!",
        "Hit it Andy!",
        "Don\u2019t set it to yourself!",

        "Okay. Fine.",
        "Except, you know what? It\u2019s not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?",
        "No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?",
        "Seven? Can I finish please?",

        "Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.",
        "Okay, let me finish this thought.",
        "He most definitely does. He\u2019s been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.",
        "People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it\u2019s because of my low cheekbones. And\u2026 boom.  Okay, what is it, what can\u2019t I guess?",
        "Stanley\u2019s way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.",

        "Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right.  One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you  will make a great mother. It\u2019s up to you to choose which you want to be.",

For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick\u2013 let\u2019s get him. Tock\u2013 let\u2019s get Jim! Tick\u2013 and drag Jim out of his office! Tock\u2013 take his keys away from him! Tick\u2013 that\u2019s a clock! The time is getting very close! It\u2019s now or never! What say you?!",

        "No. No.",
        "You would?",
        "Really?",
        "Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.",
        "Oh no. Now that I don\u2019t have a room, can I stay with you?",
        "Please?",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha!  That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.",

        "It worked.",
        "From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It\u2019s all in the report.",
        "Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim\u2026 the bad man was busy kissing the boss man\u2019s butt.",

        "No.",

        "No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.",
        "Exactly.",

        "Not the living in fear, that\u2019s new.",
        "Yes. He\u2019s got to stand up to this mafia guy.",

        "Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.",
        "It\u2019s true, he\u2019s clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn\u2019t on the take. Turns out he\u2019s a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.",

        "This conversation has two items on the agenda.",
        "Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It\u2019s not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don\u2019t care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two\u2026 I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I\u2019d just like to say\u2026  con-quack-ulations!",
        "You\u2019re welcome!",
        "I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.",
        "I\u2019m sorry to have been bugging you all these years.",
        "Mallard. Okay, I\u2019ll get out of your hair.",

        "The Nard Dog\u2026 what was that all about?",
        "What were you talking about in there?",
        "Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.",

        "I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.",

        "Excellent.",
        "Okay.  You owe me.",
        "Can\u2019t a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they\u2019ll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?",
        "Pam, would you care for a bagel?",

        "Let\u2019s get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.",

I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble.  Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there.  A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.",

So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night\u2019s sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets\u2026  Time to get to work .",

        "Peepa, how is she?",
        "Great! Oh, that\u2019s great\u2026 We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?",
        "Now, listen,\u2026",
        "Okay, I know why you\u2019re saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat  is the strong hand you want on the wheel.",
        "I\u2019m going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight\u2019s Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam\u2026",
        "Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.",
        "Ha ha!",
        "Fine. I\u2019ll do it without you, but you\u2019ll regret this.",
        "Let me get that for you.",
        "Okay.",
        "Jo, may I speak to you for a second?",
        "Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I\u2019ve learned so much from them. I\u2019d like to be interviewed for the position.",
        "Okay.",
        "It\u2019s complicated.",
        "Assistant Regional Manager.",
        "Assistant Regional Manager.",
        "Assistant Regional Manager.",
        "Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo\u2026  It\u2019s me. I\u2019m Dwight.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you\u2019d ever seen!",
        "Yes.",
        "Silence?",
        "Dwight Schrute.",
        "You have to interview me\u2026",
        "I demand more questions!",
        "Okay! If you\u2019re not going to interview me, then I\u2019ll do it.",
        "What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and\u2026  getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again?  That\u2019s a great question.  I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.",
        "Thank you.  You\u2019ll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you\u2019re gonna like the call you\u2019re going to receive.  Oh, come on. I\u2019m just happy that I got this meeting.",
        "Well, it\u2019s not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone\u2019s getting a little power-mad.",
        "What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.",
        "We\u2019re gonna miss you, Gabe.",
        "I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or\u2026  I don\u2019t know. Something always works out.",
        "No, I insist.",
        "K\u2026 Kevin!",
        "Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I\u2019ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I\u2019ve added boxing \u2013 lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I\u2019m doin\u2019 great.",
        "K, I\u2019m gonna need some help. Pam?",
        "Hoist him aloft. C\u2019mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl.",
        "Say no more.",
        "Kids, don\u2019t try planking. It\u2019s dangerous.  \u2018Specially with me around.",
        "What are you looking at?",
        "It can\u2019t be nothing.",
        "Nice catch.",
        "Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?",
        "\u2026 2, 3!",
        "Okay, which side of the list am I on?",
        "Yes!",
        "This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here\u2019s something. Who would eat who in an \u2018Alive\u2019 situation. No\u2026 that can\u2019t be it.",
        "Shhh, Pam. C\u2019mon, don\u2019t be such a right-sider.",
        "No, it\u2019s not. Here\u2019s how we find out. Let\u2019s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let\u2019s just size each other up here and left side of the list\u2026 ATTACK!",
        "That\u2019s great. Let\u2019s do this guys.",
        "You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question\u2026 what made you pick this group?",
        "Okay!",
        "Losers.",
        "C\u2019mon.",
        "C\u2019mon, c\u2019mon.",
        "C\u2019mon.",
        "Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!",
        "Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it\u2019s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.",
        "Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.",
        "Good night.",
        "Man, it\u2019s like hoisting a manatee. I can\u2019t get a grip it\u2019s so vast.",
        "God. How do whalers do it?",
        "Steak. Rare.",
        "One more. To our boss!",
        "You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.",
        "I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?",
        "Oh, tips are expected?",
        "Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl\u2026.",
        "Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!",
        "Winners!",

        "OK, let\u2019s look at some ties.",
        "Here\u2019s how I\u2019m going to help out from now on. I\u2019m going to not care, and I\u2019m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy\u2019s inevitable demise.",

        "Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don\u2019t see the point. It\u2019s so Wall Street.",
        "Right?",
        "Good. Really really good.",
        "Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.",

        "Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can\u2019t lie with his body.",

        "Exactly.",
        "Okay, just shut it.",
        "I can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s unnaturally sunken.  Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?",
        "Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.",
        "Time for me to find out.",
        "Just going to walk over here-  whoa, whoa, I\u2019m slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to!",
        "I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m totally fine.",
        "Yes?  Wha- Jim.",
        "Aw, cramp, I\u2019m just-",
        "I\u2019m sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.",
        "Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.",
        "She called it crazy? Aw, man, that\u2019s insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.",
        "And she called it nuts?",
        "Come on.",
        "Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.",
        "Why don\u2019t you go check out the sympathy cards, old man?  Now I\u2019m going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?",
        "We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.",
        "Well, that\u2019s what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.",
        "Jim, are you serious?",
        "Okay, you\u2019re done.",
        "Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?",
        "Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?",
        "Yep, he\u2019s lying.",
        "I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he\u2019s lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?",
        "Look at the numbers. Every single time, it\u2019s come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.",
        "Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.",
        "It\u2019s important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-",
        "It\u2019s not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.",
        "Doesn\u2019t it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?",
        "But\u2026 hey, Cece\u2019s toothbrush.",
        "Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.",
        "Ha!",
        "The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms.  Whatever. I\u2019m over it. It\u2019s just grossly irresponsible.",
        "Guess I\u2019m a sucker for historical fiction.",
        "Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you\u2019re talking about D.P.A., that\u2019s deaths per acre\u2026",
        "\u2026nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.",
        "Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush.  I\u2019m telling you, they\u2019re heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.",
        "The truth.",
        "No, no, no! You\u2019re filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I\u2019m telling the truth.",
        "Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.",
        "Okay, I will. I don\u2019t know who that is, but I\u2019m gonna tell you this-",
        "Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?",
        "Not by a long shot!",
        "No, it was not!",
        "No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?",
        "Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!",
        "Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.",
        "Excuse me, I got a question for you.",
        "Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?",
        "Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?",
        "You said you weren\u2019t going to look back.",
        "Really?",
        "Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.",
        "YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.",
        "Hallowed ground.",
        "I\u2019ve seen enough.",
        "I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let\u2019s go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke\u2019s on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.",
        "Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn\u2019t hurt to have a smile on your face, either.",
        "It\u2019s not locked, gimme that\u2026",
        "It\u2019s, it\u2019s latched closed.",
        "Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.",
        "Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.",
        "Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you\u2019re in a suicide cult.",
        "Oh yeah?",
        "That\u2019s right Jim.",
        "Hey.",
        "No. Putting a load on more like it.",
        "Last thing I need is luck.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!",
        "Oh that\u2019s real creative.",
        "I could, but I just don\u2019t feel like it loser.",
        "Standing.",
        "Don\u2019t!",
        "Standing.",
        "I know.",
        "Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.",
        "Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?",
        "Well today\u2019s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute\u2019s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?",
        "Your path from obesity begins right here!",
        "Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.",
        "Maybe you do. Hi. I\u2019m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It\u2019s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.",
        "It\u2019s the second easiest job in the world.  Being a mom.",
        "That is true.",
        "That\u2019s me.",
        "Maybe over a beer after she\u2019s closed her first sale .",
        "Ready? What do you think?",
        "You haven\u2019t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke  Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station . You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let\u2019s go over membership. I\u2019m going to need the first month\u2019s and the last month\u2019s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month\u2026",
        "Darryl\u2026",
        "Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute\u2019s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.",
        "Kelly?",
        "That\u2019s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.",
        "What do you think you\u2019re doing?",
        "I build you this temple to the human body, and you\u2019re lifting what, five pounds?",
        "I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?",
        "Eight minutes!",
        "Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings?  I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I\u2019m gonna make you look like Lebron James!",
        "That\u2019s what I said.",
        "I know.",
        "This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.",
        "First thing, we\u2019re gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.",
        "Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!",
        "You\u2019re nothing! You\u2019re so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?",
        "Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!",
        "All right, I\u2019ll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?",
        "No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?",
        "What do you want!?!",
        "Val Kilmer? I don\u2019t buy it. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. Wow\u2026 I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.",
        "Hey, what are you listening to?",
        "There is no shower.",
        "What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.",
        "Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I\u2019ve already covered the BM of it all. It\u2019s miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.",
        "What about my wish that we don\u2019t have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?",
        "Where? Dark side or light side?",
        "Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?",
        "Thank you, Andy.",
        "Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.",
        "I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense.",
        "What is it?",
        "No, absolutely not.",
        "Boom!",
        "Ah! I\u2019ve been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!",
        "Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!",
        "Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?",
        "Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.",
        "Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.",
        "You see?",
        "Might wanna run that by Angela cause it\u2019s so cute.",
        "Come down right away!",
        "Yes, I was quilled.",
        "Henrietta.",
        "Enough of this garbage.  This is Christmas.  Hi-yah!!!!!  Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!",
        "What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?",
        "Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How\u2019s it goin?",
        "Took a little nap right next to Jim\u2019s desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What\u2019s everyone staring at?",
        "Hey. Enjoy your new clump.",
        "It\u2019s so much closer to the bathroom, right?",
        "Uh huh.",
        "You\u2019ll be fine over there.",
        "So, I got this bucket from Jim\u2019s garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can\u2019t wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face.  Dammit Kathy!",
        "Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.",
        "You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it\u2019s going to drive me insane.",
        "Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven\u2019t managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.",
        "Dwight Schrute for Robert California!",
        "I\u2019m not here to be given anything. I\u2019m here to take what is mine.",
        "Gabe? You don\u2019t know?",
        "Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel\u2019s office.",
        "Robert.",
        "Yes.",
        "Very good.",
        "Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You\u2019re the bagel guy.",
        "Meat grinder.",
        "You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You\u2019re an American classic.",
        "But I can give you this pitch in one minute-",
        "Still an important position. Still a chief.",
        "There\u2019s no fires within eight miles of here.",
        "What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO\u2019s office on the phone this instant!",
        "So it\u2019s a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?",
        "What\u2019s with the smile?",
        "And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.",
        "Take me to Robert.",
        "Take me to his house.",
        "You know where it is. Lead me there.",
        "Listen, you\u2019re a perfectly fine toilet. I\u2019m just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let\u2019s go.",
        "Which one is it?",
        "Robert! Robert California! Robert!",
        "No thank you.",
        "Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, \u201ctable for one?\u201d How is this possible?",
        "Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-",
        "N\u2026 it\u2019s complicated.",
        "It\u2019s a job interview, not a flea market.",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh, ugh.  What is this, a meatball? Really?",
        "Jim, come on! That\u2019s so juvenile! What the-",
        "Ugh.",
        "Aw, man.  This is not very clever, Jim.",
        "Really Jim? Really? Very funny.",
        "Thirty-two meatballs.",
        "That idiot\u2019s been feeding us for a week.",
        "Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.",
        "What-",
        "I\u2019m relaxing. Scram.",
        "Oh really?",
        "Yeah, you want to play you little hick?",
        "You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?",
        "I\u2019m not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I\u2019m mighty? Because I\u2019m the manliest man in the office? I\u2019ll do it.",
        "You stop.",
        "No, you stop.",
        "Okay, you can stop.",
        "No, you can stop.",
        "Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that\u2019s so good. Ah\u2026",
        "Damn it.",
        "We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.",
        "Chicken fight!",
        "Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!",
        "Yeah- oh!",
        "Woohoo! Yes!",
        "I know. I could just bang you right now.",
        "Maybe we should take a little break.",
        "Okay.",
        "Go!",
        "Erin, did we win?",
        "You\u2019re lying. We didn\u2019t win.",
        "Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis\u2019s birthday.",
        "I know.  But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn\u2019t she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don\u2019t want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.",
        "So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.",
        "Not what I asked.",
        "So then you won\u2019t mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.",
        "You\u2019re an idiot.",
        "Uh huh.",
        "Yeah\u2026.baby.",
        "Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?",
        "No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It\u2019s like the devil\u2019s cursive.",
        "You\u2019d be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out\u2026",
        "Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.",
        "Yeah\u2026",
        "Ready?",
        "RAHHH!!!!!!!",
        "Get her! Ruin her!",
        "Can\u2019t believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.",
        "Of course you found him not guilty.  \u201cOh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.\u201d",
        "Not coming, have plans.",
        "I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I\u2019d won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that\u2019s not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.",
        "So this whole hit and run thing, there\u2019s just one part I can\u2019t figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop\u2026",
        "And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?",
        "See, that\u2019s what I\u2019m having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle.  Busted, Halpert!",
        "Yes! Andy, get out here.",
        "I am making a citizen\u2019s arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight\u2019s rights.",
        "Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don\u2019t know what this pervert likes. Fire him!",
        "I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-",
        "I don\u2019t- I don\u2019t need to take a chill pill.",
        "I really don\u2019t want to take the chill pill.",
        "Okay, okay.  But let\u2019s just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?",
        "That\u2019s good enough for me.",
        "Okay, everybody, gather \u2019round. Got a real special surprise for you.",
        "Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?",
        "No, Toby!  Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn\u2019t asking you.  Ask him if he remembers Jim.",
        "He says, \u201cNo!\u201d Boom!",
        "Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world.",
        "Great. And while we\u2019re enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don\u2019t you tell us your story again?",
        "Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?",
        "Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim\u2019s house, and then back to the courthouse?",
        "You\u2019re screwed! Oh, it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s really happening.",
        "Your clients. They\u2019re all mine.",
        "All right, well. Let\u2019s get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand.  Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I\u2019m going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you\u2019ve defeated yourself.",
        "No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-",
        "That\u2019s it? This is crap!",
        "Gabe, it\u2019s Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.",
        "I\u2019m gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.",
        "Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?",
        "Okay.",
        "Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.",
        "So don\u2019t.",
        "What?",
        "How long before?",
        "Yes I did.",
        "I want to see the baby.",
        "Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions\u2026  willingly, or as slaves.",
        "That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.",
        "Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.",
        "Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?",
        "Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.",
        "You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-",
        "-and I said, \u201cI bet I could fulfill you,\u201d and you said, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try,\u201d and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.",
        "And then I inserted my penis-",
        "Into your-",
        "Vagina and-",
        "Admit that there is a chance.",
        "Admit it. Admit it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Before I go, may I?",
        "Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.",
        "I just might be his father.",
        "Oh, right.  The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.",
        "Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.",

The cop takes me away and tells me that I\u2019ve been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women.",

The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman\u2019s only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna\u2026 take a\u2026 brief pause at this point.  Thank you.  Oh, God.

Is Dwight\u2019s pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I\u2019m not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.",

        "But you still work for Wired, right?",
        "Good! Okay. Flirt away.",
        "Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.",
        "You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.",
        "I\u2019m trying to make him feel important.",
        "Um\u2026  Oh, Ryan, you\u2019re so smart. You\u2019re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.",
        "What\u2019s a book?",
        "Jim, get him a water.",
        "Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!",
        "Have you seen Erin?",
        "Oh God\u2026 Hey no! Where do you think you\u2019re going? You\u2019ve gotta stay for the big presentation we\u2019ve got this young wiz kid \u2014 Ryan. He\u2019s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.",
        "It\u2019s moments away. Just stay here!",
        "How long has he been in the bathroom?",
        "Jeez! What\u2019s he doing in there?",
        "Are there any bloggers around?",
        "I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing\u2026 compared to this guy!",
        "That\u2019s right. Will you just give us a second?",
        "Jim \u2014",
        "Look at me. Look at me! Look\u2026 at\u2026 this\u2026 face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I\u2019m telling you\u2026 if you don\u2019t do this,  I don\u2019t stand a chance. Please, Jim.",
        "Oh, my God. O\u2026 Kay! Go get into Ryan\u2019s costume and check out his notes.",
        "Of course there\u2019s a costume!  Oh, this is gonna be great. There\u2019s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.",
        "Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?",
        "Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?",
        "You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.",
        "It\u2019s true.",
        "Yep.",
        "Psst.",
        "Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.",
        "Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!",
        "Okay! Come on!",
        "Hah! Yah!  Boom!",
        "A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man\u2019s treasure and all. Wow!",
        "Well, mister ball, it\u2019s been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da!",
        "Ah!",
        "You think you\u2019re excited? You should feel my nipples.",
        "Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that\u2019s so thoughtful.  Four!  Oh yeah!",
        "Don\u2019t even care!",
        "Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven\u2019t always got along and at times, I\u2019ve even hated your guts. But\u2026 bye, bye. I win.",
        "Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen\u2019s bet. Woohoo!",
        "Robert! I\u2019m gonna win, ha ha, I\u2019m the gentleman! Suck it!",
        "The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre   to the power of two.",
        "I told you.",
        "You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It\u2019s gonna make some really good toilet paper.",
        "What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?",
        "What, your stylist ran out of \u2018messy spray\u2019?",
        "You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop \u2019til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell.",
        "Silence.",
        "I know what you\u2019re trying to do, I don\u2019t want it.  But your face does look like the guy from Operation.",
        "Different guy.",
        "That you look like the world\u2019s tallest hobbit.",
        "Showtime.",
        "You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You\u2019re like an Amish return stick.",
        "Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?",
        "Jim, come on.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Wait.  He\u2019s gonna kill the store? And he\u2019s gonna fire me?",
        "That\u2019s two things.",
        "Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they\u2019re not going to work today.",
        "You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It\u2019s gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.",
        "Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she\u2019s a slu- Ah!",
        "Help! Help!",
        "AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.",
        "Ah!",
        "Oh, god! You\u2026 oh! My appendix-",
        "My wound hasn\u2019t healed yet.",
        "Oh, man!",
        "Rrrah!",
        "Huh, huh, huh!",
        "I was trying to go-",
        "Ok, ok.",
        "Then you know what? I\u2019m just gonna have to run right through you.",
        "Jackie Chan!",
        "This. Ends. Now.",
        "Rrahh!",
        "Anything else you need to talk about?",
        "Once again, it\u2019s show time.",
        "My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.",
        "Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here.",
        "Right here.",
        "What?",
        "How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I\u2019m in an identical situation.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t let her manage a celery farm.",
        "Those who can\u2019t farm, farm celery.",
        "I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.",
        "What?",
        "There\u2019s no limit to what I think I deserve.",
        "Five percent. No less.",
        "Six percent, I know my worth.",
        "Money isn\u2019t real ever since we got off the gold standard.",
        "No, you know what? Nellie\u2019s right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I\u2019m here. This is mine. Back off.",
        "Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.",
        "Well fought. I accept the outcome.",
        "Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.",
        "Yep.",
        "Yes!",
        "Okay, okay.",
        "Why Jim?",
        "Ugh! Ow.",
        "Don\u2019t listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? \u201cOh, I think I\u2019ll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.\u201d",
        "I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.",
        "Haulin\u2019 cube!",
        "I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.",
        "Ooh.",
        "I have to see these shoes.",
        "Oh!",
        "Here\u2019s the two of them taking a hike. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s some kind of friend.",
        "Here\u2019s the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s some kind of close romantic friend.",
        "You read my mind.",
        "Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he\u2019s a hated Italian politician.",
        "Why not call\u2026",
        "That\u2019s awful. What kind of restaurant.",
        "If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.",
        "Okay scram, wizard.",
        "You heard me!",
        "Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.",
        "I\u2019ve written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.",
        "Yes?",
        "How?",
        "Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.",
        "Okay?",
        "Washington Monument.",
        "Eiffel Tower.",
        "One of Toby\u2019s eyes is getting smaller. So there\u2019s that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I\u2019ll keep you posted on that.",
        "Every day I brief Nellie on what\u2019s going on in the office. Most of it\u2019s irrelevant. But a good informer doesn\u2019t judge what\u2019s worth passing on.",
        "Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.",
        "Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you\u2019d win, but you just demolished him! I\u2019m a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.",
        "It\u2019s not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.",
        "No, no, no, no, no, It\u2019s not me. I\u2019m gonna prove it right here and now.",
        "Yeah Jim.",
        "You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.",
        "You don\u2019t like the Beatles?",
        "Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?",
        "I don\u2019t want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed",
        "There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.",
        "That\u2019s how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male \u201changing out\u201d. Call the cops!",
        "I don\u2019t even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I\u2019m going up to the roof.  And I\u2019m gonna bring my gym bag just in case.",
        "Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22  If you\u2019re going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!",
        "You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!",
        "How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!",
        "It\u2019s $475! Like candy from a baby!",
        "Yes! Thank you!",
        "Oh yes! Yeah!",
        "Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!",
        "Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!",
        "Thank you. Wow, I can\u2019t tell you what an honor it is to support this thing\u2026 And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets\u2019 remember we are all here for the dog society. He\u2019s what\u2019s important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night!",
        "Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don\u2019t you just take estrogen?   There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you?  Mwah.",
        "Oh, I bet you think it\u2019s all about core, huh?",
        "Oh, please.",
        "Feast on this, Lewis.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "Very funny Jim.",
        "I don\u2019t need your help.",
        "Here, here\u2026 Just\u2026",
        "Good, we have a deal?",
        "Thanks so much Earl.",
        "And they said it couldn\u2019t be done. Boom!",
        "Yeah, and we\u2019re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.",
        "No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.",
        "And you are\u2026",
        "Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to \u2013 how do I put this \u2013 steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.",

        "That\u2019s true.",
        "Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could\u2019ve choked so many people by now.",
        "Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim\u2019s leg.",
        "Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.",
        "Don\u2019t listen to him.",
        "Nope.",
        "Prestige is ours. Okay, they\u2019re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.",
        "Make a decision.",
        "Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.",
        "Damn it!",
        "Wha \u2013 what is this supposed to be?",
        "Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It\u2019s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.",
        "What?",
        "It\u2019s him! Do something! Get out!",

        "This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There\u2019s me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn\u2019t come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.",

        "What? It\u2019s a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t even want to tell you what it\u2019s made of until after you try it.",
        "It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.",
        "This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don\u2019t even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd\u2019s Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.",
        "Have you ever tasted a Shepherd\u2019s Crook?",

        "In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren\u2019t as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.",
        "Stop giggling.",

        "Damn It!",
        "No, thanks. I\u2019ll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.",

        "Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it\u2019s your call.",
        "I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn\u2019t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.",
        "Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.",
        "Yes. Thank you. Amazed.",
        "What? This is such bullcrap!",
        "Wow. So much crap. It\u2019s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert\u2019s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.",
        "Guys, it wasn\u2019t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn\u2019t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.",
        "Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?",
        "Okay.",
        "They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.",
        "Oh, hey, I\u2019ll take a coffee.",
        "",
        "Who, me?",
        "Absolutely, I do.",
        "Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that\u2019s great.",
        "Aah!",
        "Welcome to the club, pig!",
        "Aah!",
        "You don\u2019t have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.",
        "You\u2019re telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?",
        "Let\u2019s go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!",
        "Pam, I\u2019ll help you.",
        "If there\u2019s anything I hate worse than art, it\u2019s crime.",
        "You need my pitchfork?",
        "What is it? I have vengeance to exact.",
        "Ah, I\u2019m not interested.",
        "If I get the deicing gig, it\u2019s not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics.",
        "I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one\u2019s business but my own.",
        "Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.",
        "Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.",
        "Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts\u2026",
        "We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him.  Nate. Your mother is dying.",
        "It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right.",
        "No. She needs her rest again.",
        "You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we\u2019ve got chewing gum.",
        "There\u2019s no gum. There never was any gum.",
        "Oh, your little feelings party didn\u2019t work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.",
        "Wait. Are you saying\u2026",
        "Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I\u2019m like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.",
        "He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that\u2019s important to him.",
        "A little eye for an eye action.",
        "Go all Hammurabi on this clown.",
        "I know just the man for the job.",
        "He even looks like a mole.",
        "I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?",
        "Silence. You\u2019ll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.",
        "Go move some paper!",
        "Great. Get the plate number.",
        "So we know which truck to van\u2026",
        "Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I\u2019m drawing your mural on Frank\u2019s truck\u2019s butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.",
        "Let\u2019s see yours.",
        "This is amazing! Frank! And he\u2019s leaving a trail of poops?",
        "I saw that. That\u2019s great!",
        "Good. I\u2019m glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.",
        "Ugh! Don\u2019t sympathize. You\u2019re ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.",
        "Come in.",
        "Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.",
        "I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.",
        "I really like Andy these days. He\u2019s pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow.  Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we\u2019re in for an epic, confusing showdown.",
        "I have yet another sales order for you to sign.",
        "Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don\u2019t know how you do it. You\u2019re a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.",
        "You\u2019re back.  And you\u2019re disgusting.",
        "Hey, Burning Man, if it\u2019s not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.",
        "No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he\u2019s been gone for the last three months.  Right? Wallace does know that you\u2019ve been gone for the last three months?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yes!",
        "Yeah!",
        "You were on a boat.",
        "On a boat.",
        "In the ocean.",
        "I\u2019m not gonna say it.",
        "Not a word.",
        "No!  What do you think you\u2019re doing?",
        "Don\u2019t you dare! Andy!",
        "Coolio.",
        "Coolio. Coolio.",
        "Coolio.",
        "No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.",
        "Please Ja, Ja\u2026",
        "Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.",
        "God! I just don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.",
        "I\u2019d like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I\u2019m a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.",
        "Fine! The state he\u2019s in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.",
        "Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.",
        "\u00e2\u20ac  lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.",
        "No, don\u2019t just let her eat the grass, she\u2019ll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I\u2019m sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she\u2019s your aunt too. Fine. I\u2019ll see what I can do.",
        "I need you.",
        "And you should take breaks more often, I\u2019ve been waiting there for 45 minutes.",
        "It\u2019s my aunt Shirley, she\u2019s on her last legs.",
        "You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it\u2019s all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was \u201cpoisoned\u201d by Aunt Shirley.",
        "Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she\u2019s an old woman Angela. She needs a woman\u2019s touch. It\u2019s all hanging out-",
        "And there\u2019s parts of her I don\u2019t even recognize.",
        "There\u2019s this one hanging part in particular, that\u2019s some sort of flap.",
        "It\u2019s like a prehensile wing or something, you know?",
        "It\u2019s a divet\u2026",
        "..where it was and it needs, it needs a\u2026",
        "How dare you?",
        "Aunt Shirley, Hello! It\u2019s me Dwight.",
        "This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!",
        "OK",
        "You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela\u2019s gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.",
        "Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?",
        "Ok.",
        "Yeah, trust me.",
        "It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.",
        "In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.",
        "Now all it takes is half a liter. She\u2019s dreaming. Alright, let\u2019s get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.",
        "No, it\u2019s a lot better than it sounds. There\u2019s a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.",
        "It\u2019s hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You\u2019re gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.",
        "You\u2019ll see. Here we go.",
        "Let\u2019s do it! Ready? Here\u2019s a box cutter to get her clothes off.",
        "Let\u2019s get to it.",
        "Give it a whirl.",
        "I need you to hose my aunt.",
        "OK you are useless.",
        "Give me the hose!",
        "Ahh! OK!",
        "Yes ma\u2019am.",
        "And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.",
        "By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?",
        "Would you like the stink sack?",
        "No, you don\u2019t eat it. It\u2019s a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.",
        "Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.",
        "Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.",
        "Leave him. He probably won\u2019t even notice that you\u2019re gone. Be with me, Monkey.",
        "I\u2019m not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life\u2026I want to spend with you.",
        "Stand by your man. It\u2019s what I would want if you were mine.",
        "Hold it!",
        "I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.",
        "I would say that she raised me, but let\u2019s not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.",
        "My actual mother was very cold and distant. I\u2019d say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.",
        "Keep them.",
        "In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday\u2019s funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "OK. That\u2019s not\u2026",
        "I really hope so.",
        "I miss her so much.",
        "You know?",
        "Zeke.",
        "Are you going?",
        "Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.",
        "Get\u2026",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Jeb, my brother.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a cemetery.",
        "Well, the only thing we\u2019re planting here is dead bodies.",
        "Well, thank god they\u2019re not because we don\u2019t want to make zombies.",
        "You had black hair and then gray hair.",
        "You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?",
        "Hello, little man. Haven\u2019t seen you in a few years.  What is this? Oh, god.  Henry.",
        "I see Esther\u2019s back in town.",
        "Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.",
        "Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.",
        "OK.",
        "So, let\u2019s get it going.",
        "We Schrutes don\u2019t need some Harvard doctor to tell us who\u2019s alive and who\u2019s dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I can\u2019t stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could\u2019ve grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.",
        "Let\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s run Aunt Shirley\u2019s farm. I\u2019m in. Boom.",
        "Of course you are.",
        "Oh my god.",
        "You know what? Let\u2019s take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley\u2019s offer.",
        "You will say \u2018yes\u2019 on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say \u2018yes\u2019, one. Yes.",
        "OK.",
        "",
        "Oui.",
        "People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.",
        "Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.",
        "Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you\u2019re gonna get made fun of a little bit.",
        "If you want.",
        "This? No. That\u2019d be cool, though. It\u2019s for milking.",
        "Did you just ask me if this was a cow?",
        "Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?",
        "Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?",
        "OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn\u2019t your father teach you anything?",
        "It.  That kid doesn\u2019t put in some farm time, he\u2019s gonna stay like that.",
        "Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It\u2019s officially a hostile work environment.",
        "Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.",
        "OK, you are useless. I\u2019ll take care of this.",
        "It\u2019s OK guys, she\u2019s no longer horny.",
        "Clark, I need your advice. I\u2019m having some lady troubles.",
        "Esther Ruger.",
        "Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.",
        "Well, we\u2019ve been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.",
        "What do you think?",
        "A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.",
        "Esther\u2019s on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let\u2019s see, I know she likes apples and carrots.",
        "Did I tell you about her teeth?",
        "Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.",
        "Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.",
        "Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I\u2019m interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.",
        "Ok ok ok, wait! You win.",
        "Security deposit. That\u2019s been-",
        "Right, standard.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.",
        "What? Don\u2019t you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you\u2019ve got two minutes and then the cap comes off.",
        "Go on.",
        "No.",
        "What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?",
        "No woman would ever want a man who doesn\u2019t know what an auger is.",
        "I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me.",
        "Maybe you\u2019re right. Esther\u2019s a ten and the best I\u2019ve ever done is Angela who\u2019s a nine and she rejected me.",
        "Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we\u2019re the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that\u2019s already been rode hard and put away muddy.",
        "By hand.",
        "I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything left for us to talk about, Esther.",
        "No.",
        "That snake!",
        "That shady grove out by Willard\u2019s pond.",
        "So, you\u2019re fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?",
        "No!",
        "Post hole digging.",
        "Well, the alert was already set to \u201cRed\u201d because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to \u201cDouble Red\u201d?",

        "Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could\u2019ve met in the lobby. It\u2019s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.",
        "The buyer is your sister\u2019s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that\u2019s an order.",

        "Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.",
        "So what I\u2019m hearing you say is, \u201cMake Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible\u201d?",
        "Mm-hmm. Good luck.",
        "For five years I\u2019ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it\u2019s time for me to just let that thought go. It\u2019s kind of painful, but it\u2019s also freeing in a way. Now it\u2019s all about my instincts.",
        "Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.",
        "Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It\u2019s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.",

        "Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to.  Grab his feet.  Let\u2019s go!",
        "Move it! One, two, three.",
        "He\u2019s like a manatee. Ready? Let\u2019s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three!  Oh, God. No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.",
        "Yes.",

        "Let\u2019s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?",
        "Okay, listen. I\u2019m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I\u2019ve never actually done this before.",
        "Thank you. I mean, I\u2019ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh\u2026",

        "",
        "Okay, now here\u2019s the plan. I\u2019m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.",
        "Yeah.",

        "It\u2019s 15 feet down, it\u2019s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it\u2019s like your catching a medicine\u2014",
        "Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.",
        "You okay?",
        "Almost there. Almost there.  Okay. We\u2019re running late. Let\u2019s get him inside.",
        "Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that\u2019s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Let\u2019s get him inside.",
        "Well, I\u2019ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.",
        "Fine, let\u2019s go.",
        "Hoist his shank on three.",
        "It\u2019s by the tenderloin.",

        "Got it?",
        "Get in the back.",
        "Get in the back.",
        "Get in.",

        "Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we\u2019ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.",
        "New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let\u2019s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let\u2019s go.",
        "And for\u2014oh, whoopsie daisy.",
        "He\u2019s fine. He gets carsick really easily.",
        "It\u2019s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we\u2019re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?",
        "Stanley.",
        "Look at him. I\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful child.",
        "Like this? Watch.",
        "Right? Come on!",
        "Yeah, maybe I\u2019ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it\u2019s the most pleasant I\u2019ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.",
        "You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn\u2019t even know it. I\u2019ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh.  Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.",
        "Well\u2014no, no\u2014n\u2014",
        "We need a winch and a hoist.",
        "Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.  It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It\u2019s not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean.  Practically made of plastic.",
        "I\u2019m pumped!",
        "I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I\u2019m with Esther now.  She\u2019s younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let\u2019s be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.",
        "Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?",
        "Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it\u2019s in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.",
        "I call for a refold!",
        "It\u2019s a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.",
        "Whoo!",
        "Come on Clark!",
        "Whoa!",
        "Watch and learn.",
        "Yes!",
        "Oh, Esther.",
        "What are you-  You\u2019re here early.",
        "I like a little feather in my nuggets.",
        "Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.",
        "In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.",
        "Yeah! Ok! Beat that!  Whoo! Ok.",
        "After you.",
        "Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how\u2019d that happen? God.",
        "Alright.",
        "Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office.  Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and\u2014",
        "Smasher? No, where\u2019d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city\u2019s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.",
        "I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don\u2019t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.",
        "I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.",
        "Ah!  That\u2019s how it\u2019s done.",
        "He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!",
        "Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself.",
        "Just slip it off my\u2014Slip it off my hips.",
        "He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.",
        "There it is.",
        "We did it, we did it. I love you.",
        "Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You\u2019re gonna watch me right?",
        "Sensei, you\u2019re not watching.",
        "Watching?",
        "Watch this part, okay?",
        "You did not just say that! You don\u2019t know Pam. She is really cool.",
        "Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It\u2019s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I\u2019d be happy to see Jim as manager.",
        "You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.",
        "Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager\u2019s job?",
        "Yeah, right. I\u2019m afraid that ship has sailed.",
        "Hello.",
        "Big day for you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "This is exciting! You\u2019re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.",
        "Oh, I doubt you\u2019ll make it. Very few do who\u2019ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you\u2019ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?",
        "Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don\u2019t quit your day job.",
        "You\u2019re bad.",
        "Say it again.",
        "Where?",
        "What branch?",
        "I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.",
        "But this isn\u2019t interim manager. No. It\u2019s Dwight K. Schrute\u2026  Manager.",
        "In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.",
        "I will never, ever let you down.",
        "David. Can I just do one thing while you\u2019re making this announcement and then I\u2019ll never, ever do it again?",
        "It\u2019s just one thing. Just let me\u2014let me do this\u2014",
        "Just wait and send it to voicemail.",
        "Come on. Come on.",
        "Dwight Schrute is manager!",
        "Pam.",
        "Thank you, Jim.",
        "Get out of Jim\u2019s seat.",
        "You\u2019re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we\u2019ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.",
        "So\u2026",
        "I wanted to offer you a new position.",
        "Assistant regional manager.",
        "Jim.",
        "Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.",
        "So, all the numbers adding up?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yes, it is. Carry on.",
        "You okay?",
        "Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.",
        "Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they\u2019re protecting America\u2019s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day\u2019s security codes. Something that\u2019s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It\u2019s not the KGB, but it\u2019s a start.",
        "But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.",
        "This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?",
        "The coffee in Paraguay is colder?",
        "Ah, much, ok.",
        "No, no. Give me the steam.",
        "It\u2019s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I\u2019d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.",
        "Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!",
        "Oh, don\u2019t worry. They\u2019ll get got.",
        "Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check\u2026 on that later today. This is my grandmother\u2019s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother\u2019s buttock bullet ring.",
        "You know what to do.  Ok",
        "Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.",
        "Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we\u2019ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War\u2014",
        "Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.",
        "Welcome.",
        "Please take an agenda item.",
        "Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. \u201cSome say the only failure there is is the failure to try.\u201d  That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.",
        "What is going on?",
        "Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.",
        "I\u2019m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.",
        "Not now! Private time!",
        "Hey, hey! Seriously?",
        "Which is, of course\u2026",
        "Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.",
        "The power source.",
        "A loyal, but bungling apostle.",
        "Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.",
        "I\u2019d have to get some more wire and string, but it\u2019s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?",
        "I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?",
        "That doesn\u2019t sound crazy, Jim. That\u2019s the sanest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.",
        "That means ye, Plop!",
        "We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?",
        "You\u2019ll always have the upper hand, when you\u2019ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.",
        "Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.",
        "You don\u2019t need to repeat right now, when I\u2019m saying it.",
        "Not even close, Meredith. Come on!",
        "Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other\u2019s minds. You\u2019re trying to give your wife this job.",
        "No, no, no, no! You don\u2019t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There\u2019s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don\u2019t have diplomatic relations.",
        "A thousand times more.",
        "No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?",
        "Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee!  Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here\u2019s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!",
        "I know.",
        "Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-",
        "Me.",
        "Yes!  Thank you.",
        "Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?",
        "Smart baby. That\u2019s the most flavorful bond.",
        "Oink the pigs, that is very important.",
        "The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.",
        "Thank you, Esther.",
        "I need you to perform a test.",
        "On an innocent baby.",
        "Damn straight.",
        "Hey, he can handle it.",
        "Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there\u2019s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.",
        "Okay.  You ever been in a manager\u2019s office before?",
        "Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It\u2019s called \u201cSchrute or Consequences.\u201d You\u2019re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?",
        "Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you\u2019re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.",
        "That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he\u2019s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.",
        "Door. Chair. It\u2019s about Phillip.",
        "I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.",
        "Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let\u2019s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man\u2019s closet.",
        "Very well.",
        "Yes.",
        "Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.",
        "Now.",
        "Jim. I\u2019m not kidding. I need you.",
        "I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.",
        "She\u2019s got a ton of great qualities. She\u2019s young, she\u2019s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we\u2019re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn\u2019t technically incest.",
        "Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.",
        "And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.",
        "Angela.",
        "Some sort of virus?",
        "Oh.",
        "You\u2019re a good assistant, Jim.",
        "That\u2019s very true. Get the hell outta here.",
        "Pull over!",
        "Move to the side of the road!",
        "Pull over!",
        "Shut up, woman!",
        "Listen to me! I love you! And I don\u2019t care that Phillip\u2019s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!",
        "This expresses how loudly I love you.",
        "This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.",
        "I love you!",
        "What?",
        "What? Why would you say that\u2014",
        "Get out! I\u2019m a dad!",
        "The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?",

        "In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I\u2019m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there\u2019s a mini-reunion. A kind of a \u201cwhere are they now\u201d panel at a local theatre. It\u2019ll be nice to see everyone again.  I haven\u2019t seen Kevin since we let him go.",
        "Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.",
        "No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is\u2026for\u2026Kevin.",
        "Go ahead and just read the frosting.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "It\u2019s a colloquial way of saying \u201cyou\u2019re fired,\u201d Kevin, which you are.",

        "Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.",

        "Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here\u2019s your cake.   Bye, bye Toby.",
        "That is all. Have a good morning.",
        "What was that for?",
        "Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.",
        "Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he\u2019s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.",
        "I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band \u201cThe Grass Roots\u201d in the 1960\u2019s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.",
        "Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won\u2019t be necessary tonight.",
        "Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he\u2019s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.",
        "What? Ooh!",
        "I thought you guys couldn\u2019t come.",
        "Uh, better ask Jim.",
        "Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn\u2019t on the itinerary.",
        "Jim\u2026wha\u2026 Come on! What\u2026what are you gonna whack me, Jim?",
        "A bazooka. You remembered.",
        ". Get out of my way.",
        "Woo! Okay!",
        "Amazing.",
        "Man, how long have we been sitting here?",
        "Oh, Thank God. We are famished!",
        "No, we haven\u2019t ordered anything. No one\u2019s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?",
        "Oh, we do. So we\u2019ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.",
        "Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that\u2019s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?",
        "Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef\u2019s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won\u2019t work. That\u2019s no good.",
        "Now, for the last time, I\u2019d like a side salad with balsamic.",
        "You\u2019re telling me!",
        "What for? We haven\u2019t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato?  Do you have those? Those aren\u2019t deep fried, right?",
        "Oh, man, never thought I\u2019d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow.",
        "Good old Mose.",
        "Oh, great. He\u2019s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.",

        "Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!",
        "Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!   Oh.",

        "I heard you say \u201cwell\u201d the first time.",
        "It was nothing personal. It\u2019s just that you were terrible at your job.",
        "No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.",
        "That\u2019s it.",
        "I missed you Kevin.",
        "Ohh.",
        "You\u2019ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?",

        "Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you\u2019re ever in the area, you\u2019ll always have a place to stay\u2026in my barn.",
        "Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don\u2019t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So\u2026 have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let\u2019s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So\u2026yes. I\u2019d say I have gotten along with my subordinates."

        "Oh, is he\u2026",
        "Andy.",
        "So tell me about your new girlfriend.",
        "Aww, cute.",
        "That\u2019s Gabe\u2019s boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.",
        "No, come on.",
        "Come on!",
        "Ha!",
        "Don\u2019t mind us. You keep working.",
        "Oh, my God. It\u2019s a song.",
        "What do you think is on it?",
        "Not if we\u2019re talking like this. I think it\u2019s okay. He doesn\u2019t seem to hear us.",
        "Darryl.",
        "No, he\u2019s not.",
        "Okay. Then no more talking. Let\u2019s just play the song.",
        "What do you\u2026",
        "I guess we just have to wait until night and see.",
        "Oh. Cool.",
        "Super romantic.",
        "Yeah. Did you not see it?",
        "Hanks.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Oh. One Erin Special, please.",
        "That\u2019s my favorite.",
        "B-9.",
        "Like a benign tumor.",
        "Oh, yes. There\u2019s a note. \u201cA little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine\u2019s kiss.\u201d",
        "Mm. Oh. We\u2019re suppose to\u2026mmm",
        "Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody\u2019s dying to see it.",
        "Sorry we\u2019re late. Gabe fell in the shower.",
        "Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there.  Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!",
        "Thank you Pam.",
        "Hey sailor! Come watch it over here!",
        "Pam gave it to me!",
        "I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.",
        "Oh! If you\u2019re going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon.  Thanks.",
        "If you\u2019re not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.",
        "Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!",
        "For Pete\u2019s sake it just needs to be done!",
        "Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.",
        "Oh, that\u2019s how Pam does it. I just copy her. She\u2019s sort of a living legend.",
        "Dunder Mifflin, this is\u2026 oh, I like it!",
        "Oh, assist.",
        "Yeah, ok, good.",
        "What do you think?",
        "\u2026I\u2019m so sorry. Sorry.",
        "Deangelo, did you order a barber?",
        "Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.",
        "Deangelo, this box came for you.",
        "Oh hey, didn\u2019t see you.",
        "I don\u2019t know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m going to the Dundies!!",
        "Get away from the car, he\u2019s gonna see you.",
        "Just get in! Get in! Just get in!",
        "Please! Sorry. Get in.  Sorry sorry sorry.",
        "I eat lunch in the car now.  It\u2019s my alone time. It\u2019s just nice to have some time away from Gabe.",
        "I, really don\u2019t like spending time with him.",
        "Thank you Jim.",
        "I can\u2019t just dump him Pam, I\u2019m not like you, I can\u2019t be mean.",
        "DeAngelo, Jo\u2019s on the phone for you.",
        "Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I\u2019ve ever won in my entire life.  People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don\u2019t feel it. And I think that\u2019s because I\u2019m not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.",
        "I\u2019m not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam?  Thank you for hearing me.",
        "Gabe!",
        "You can\u2019t be in here. This is a lady\u2019s room!",
        "Hey Creed.",
        "I really think you should leave.",
        "Can we talk about this later, I have to go.",
        "Gabe!",
        "I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he\u2019s begging me to reconsider, but I\u2026 I just think I\u2019m in love with someone else.",
        "Andy.",
        "I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.",
        "I\u2019m not attracted to Kevin.",
        "Extension 147.",
        "I know.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Deangelo?",
        "Who should I say is calling?",
        "Ooh, about what?",
        "I thought I needed to know for your calendar.",
        "Oh! Darryl\u2019s funny.",
        "2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or \u2013",
        "He\u2019s just gonna call back.",
        "What?",
        "Dwight doesn\u2019t trust robots to give us our messages.",
        "I\u2019m taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.",
        "Andy!",
        "I\u2019ll go with you.",
        "Navy blue. Little red anchors.",
        "She had so much \u2013",
        "Hey.",
        "It\u2019s good. I really hope you get it!",
        "Still, I\u2019d really like to see this office with you in the boss\u2019s chair.",
        "You in the boss\u2019s chair!",
        "Did you hear anything?",
        "So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but\u2026",
        "Yeah. I\u2019m sure I was just another Porky\u2019s baby.",
        "But why not find out.",
        "I think Andy should be the boss. He\u2019s just so great. If I\u2019m being objective, then Darryl, of course.",
        "I\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can do that.",
        "Well, that\u2019s not my personality.",
        "Yes?",
        "I do really want him.",
        "Jo, you have one more candidate. He\u2019s a burn victim.",
        "He\u2019s all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.",
        "Ahh!",
        "I\u2019ve been turned into a puppet!",
        "I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!",
        "And there\u2019s only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.",
        "I need the most special thing in the office.",
        "A date with the best salesman\u2026 Andy Bernard!",
        "Oh.",
        "I\u2019ve done it all my life.",
        "I see it.  I see it like I see a mountain that I\u2019m standing in front of  and facing, and I\u2019m like\u2026",
        "Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t. But I am so excited to be a part of it.",
        "Here we go.",
        "Robert California. Let\u2019s have a conversation.",
        "Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-",
        "Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I\u2019ve been doing this thing-",
        "Pam, pam. Psst. Pam.",
        "No.",
        "Andy, don\u2019t go in there!",
        "I like my new group. I liked my old group.",
        "Um, D-Dog, you have a message.",
        "Andy wants us to, P-Dog.",
        "Justine.  She said she\u2019s coming by later.",
        "Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you\u2019re here?",
        "Oh, sorry.",
        "Oh",
        "Yeah.  It\u2019s old.",
        "I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said \u201ccoffee\u201d\u2026.",
        "Andy, you don\u2019t want that.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Yes!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey. Maybe it\u2019d help to just talk it over. Over a cup of cool old tea.",
        "What if you were to just start with your ideas about how to double profits. Just say them all and maybe one of them will rise to the top.",
        "Well I have an idea.",
        "What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You\u2019d get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart\u2019s.",
        "I just wanted to say congratulations on your new job, officially.",
        "I saw it at the checkout counter, it made me think of you. I don\u2019t know why. I made it into a key chain.",
        "There\u2019s a dog in the car.",
        "As long as you guys don\u2019t need me up here.",
        "I didn\u2019t feel anything.",
        "You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it!",
        "You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!",
        "And we did.",
        "Jim? Tell them what it\u2019s called.",
        "Jim\u2026",
        "Why\u2019s it so far away?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You\u2019re doing great! A little farther away from the wall!",
        "Good\u2026",
        "Six months.",
        "Ahh!",
        "I think we should toast\u2026",
        "It\u2019s either taping or calling.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Here you go.",
        "When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don\u2019t mention one of the best parts. After you\u2019re done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.",
        "Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you\u2019re doing something I don\u2019t.",
        "That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he\u2019s like, fax these documents, please. The next he\u2019s like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin\u2019s feeling, right?",
        "Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?",
        "That\u2019s like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.",
        "Yeah\u2026",
        "Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can\u2019t deny.",
        "Oh, I didn\u2019t. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?",
        "Oh, I put those up.",
        "I don\u2019t know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so\u2026",
        "Oh.",
        "Hey.",
        "November\u2019s sure creeping up, ain\u2019t it? Can\u2019t stop that month!",
        "Hey, what\u2019s the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?",
        "But that\u2019s it? There\u2019s nothing about me, or I?",
        "Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.",
        "Gabe?",
        "I\u2019m throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little.  I think it could use some extra pizazz.",
        "Remember that Halloween party you took me to once?  The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn\u2019t stop crying?",
        "Ok.  Let\u2019s say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one.  Just\u2026 more adult\u2026 more\u2026  scary and sexy",
        "No \u2013 just scary.  If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.",
        "What are you thinking?",
        "Witch\u2019s brew?",
        "I grew this party up real fast.  Get out of here little kid party.  Nobody loves you.  And clean up your room!  Grownups are going to use it later!  Oooh!",
        "Thanks.  It\u2019s on medium.",
        "Oh, so we don\u2019t have to have that talk.",
        "Oookayyy everybody.  Be prepared to be scared.  Ok.",
        "I\u2019m sorry.  I got confused.  I heard you wanted to make the party more adult.  But I think I know what to do now .  This game is called \u201cpecker Poker\u201d.   It\u2019s the game of cards that gets you hard.",
        "All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so\u2026",
        "Sure.",
        "And she\u2019s never called here.  Unless it\u2019s your mom.",
        "Two dates? Three dates?",
        "Wow.  I\u2019m so happy for you guys.  Um let me know when you get to forty.  I\u2019ll see you guys.",
        "I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.",
        "I don\u2019t know, Phyllis. Maybe she\u2019s from the city.",
        "",
        "Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.",
        "You\u2019re a real crumb bum, you know that?",
        "Dwight\u2019s car is gone.",
        "Uh, he\u2019s at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.",
        "Do you need a hand?",
        "Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.",
        "Haho!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Who\u2019s calling?",
        "You\u2019re not going to take it?",
        "Ohohohoh.",
        "You\u2019re not going to get it though?",
        "Copy that.",
        "Andy.",
        "You have a very important call.",
        "Are you sure? It\u2019s really, really important.",
        "Really? Because your mother is dead.",
        "She\u2019s dead. She was hit by a bus.",
        "This isn\u2019t one of those times. It\u2019s the police. They said it\u2019s the worst they\u2019ve ever seen.",
        "Line 2.",
        "Oh.",
        "Drive carefully!",
        "It\u2019s right here in PA.",
        "I\u2019m in.",
        "Cool. Thanks.",
        "Yeah, but I\u2019m confused\u2026",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.",
        "Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would\u2019ve believed everything he said.",
        "Interesting.",
        "No!",
        "Get out of here!",
        "Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?",
        "No. It\u2019s like two hours and forty-six minutes.",
        "There you are. Dillinger Graphics said their shipment is late.",
        "Nothing, I just-",
        "That it\u2019ll be the first shipment out today.",
        "Hoo-hoo!",
        "Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.",
        "Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.",
        "Here you go.",
        "Well that\u2019s a sales desk.",
        "That\u2019s adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?",
        "He just rolled out and crawled out.",
        "Um, where\u2019s the shower?",
        "I love Jessica, and I haven\u2019t even met her yet. It\u2019s like we don\u2019t even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.",
        "Oh no, no. It\u2019s fine, Kelly.",
        "That\u2019s OK, I don\u2019t want you to do that.",
        "Jessica. Yes. We don\u2019t say hi, we hug.  I\u2019m Erin.",
        "Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.",
        "Wow.",
        "Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.",
        "Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did.",
        "Oh.",
        "Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.",
        "OK.",
        "Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!",
        "Hit \u2018er up.",
        "Yeah!",
        "I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie.  and then I want my nap!",
        "Whoo!  Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "A thousand.",
        "Maybe you should mind your own business.  Just kidding!",
        "Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I\u2019m so happy you guys are together. OK?  And you both have such beautiful hair.",
        "I hope you guys get married\u2026.and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.",
        "And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss.  Ah!  OK, well I\u2019m gonna go do another reverse spit. That\u2019s how the cool kids say \u201cget a drink\u201d.",
        "Hey.",
        "Every martini has an olive.",
        "Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.",
        "It\u2019s about you.",
        "It\u2019s that I wish Jessica was dead.",
        "I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground\u2026with worms coming out of her mouth.",
        "Too late! It\u2019s already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar?",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "Game on.",
        "I would like another alcohol.",
        "And\u2026",
        "And you have any advice or anything?",
        "\u2026Help me feel better\u2026",
        "Thank you, goodnight.",
        "Sorry guys, Jim! This package came for you, do you want me to put it on your desk?",
        "Does anyone have a first aid kit?",
        "Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.",
        "What is it?",
        "I did my part, babe. I\u2019m just the bell girl.",
        "Flying jib.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that\u2019s so great to hear.",
        "I\u2019m not going to be one of those exes who can\u2019t move on. They have their life and I have mine. I\u2019m taking an Italian class. So far I\u2019ve learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini\u2026 Well it\u2019s not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.",
        "I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn\u2019t drive maybe ever.",
        "How do you know where I live?",
        "Why?",
        "Oh. Come on.",
        "Wow. Andy\u2019s such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order.",
        "Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.",
        "How is everything? How\u2019s your car?",
        "Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?",
        "Oh, like a goodbye trip.",
        "Hi.",
        "I guess Andy isn\u2019t totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn\u2019t survive, and I believe him.",
        "Hey, Dwight Snoot.",
        "What you doing?",
        "Ow.",
        "Come on, don\u2019t you want to play?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh!",
        "Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.",
        "Oh Dwight!",
        "Stop.",
        "No, you stop.",
        "Is he looking?  Oh. You can stop.",
        "No, no, no, he\u2019s not looking.",
        "You can actually stop.",
        "Andy\u2019s not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.",
        "What is the most romantic possible thing?",
        "Dwight, that\u2019s just- that\u2019s really perfect. Thank you.",
        "Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.",
        "Dang it! What the heck already?",
        "Yes! Woo!",

        "The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it's kind of pathetic. But when you're with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Okay!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh well, Andy, we're not moving to Cornell.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oy. Andy, what's going on?",
        "Well, um, you know maybe you're the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just\u2013",
        "Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.",
        "Oh.",

        "Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn\u2019t how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it\u2019s a girlfriend\u2019s job to know her man and I know Andy.  He\u2019s seriously juvenile.",

        "Yeah! OK! Let\u2019s go.",
        "Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.",
        "Alright.",
        "Let\u2019s do it!",

        "What does that one do?",
        "I wish I had seen you do it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, we\u2019re doing it. We\u2019re finally having a picnic on the boat.",
        "Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.",
        "As long as we\u2019re on this boat, as far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re the captain.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Nice!",
        "Do you even know what you\u2019re doing?",
        "Bahamas, Andy.",
        "Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.",
        "Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he\u2019d asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.",
        "OK!",
        "Thanks for covering the phones.",
        "Fine.",
        "Does he have a flipper?",

        "Ok.",
        "Thanks.",

        "Yeah.",

        "He\u2019s absolutely right. I\u2019m really struggling.",
        "It\u2019s just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.",
        "Yes.",
        "Uh!",
        "Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.",
        "I know. That\u2019s great. It just \u2013 it makes it look like there\u2019s an eyebrow in the middle of your face.",
        "A handsome eyebrow, but, um\u2026 it makes your mouth look like an eye socket\u2026 which isn\u2019t bad.",

        "Holy wow, that\u2019s a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!",
        "Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I\u2019ve ever seen. You are all clear.",
        "Next!",
        "Lice. More lice.  Angela has lice.",

        "Yikers, lice.",
        "Oh yeah, big time lice.",
        "No! Stanley! If you leave now then you\u2019ll get it in your car and then you\u2019ll get it in your house!",
        "I\u2019m trying to save you from yourself!",
        "No, no. It\u2019s more of a nuisance really. It\u2019s not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats\u2026",
        "To be washed.",
        "No, all we need is mayonnaise.",
        "Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it\u2019s a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.",
        "Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks\u2026It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I\u2019m so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.",
        "Once it\u2019s all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.",
        "Okay, it\u2019s easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.",
        "Oh, Creed, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m already partners with Pete, right Pete?",

        "Dwight, are you okay!?",
        "Wow. He got to purple.",
        "You\u2019re up.",
        "You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.",
        "Okay. Okay.  Is that too cold?",
        "Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.",
        "What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it\u2019s in order? I  haven\u2019t been trained for this.",
        "Hi guys!",
        "Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.",
        "Thank you!",
        "I don\u2019t really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone\u2019s trust. About the pens.",
        "The pen delivery went amazing, and now I\u2019ve got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I\u2019m not one of those people who\u2019s just like, \u201cUh, sure. I\u2019ll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back\u2019s turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand\u2026 they are just sitting here. Pam didn\u2019t tell me not to unpack them. Don\u2019t want to be a busybody, but I don\u2019t want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it\u2019s insane! I\u2019m sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I\u2019ve never had an espresso before. They\u2019re good though.",
        "No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it\u2019s the truth, I swear.",
        "No, I\u2019m not!  It\u2019s not like that at all! Forget it, I\u2019m so sorry.",
        "Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you\u2019ve had.",
        "You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That\u2019s what happened. The pens happened.",
        "Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.",
        "It\u2019s just Pete in sunglasses.",
        "And then we had him \u201cLike\u201d Dunder Mifflin.",
        "So far, we\u2019re only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.",
        "All right.",
        "Pete and I work well together \u2014 not that there\u2019s anything special about Pete. It could be any guy\u2026 or girl\u2013 not that I\u2019m into girls. Not that I\u2019m into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?",
        "Oh, my gosh!",
        "Wow. That guy\u2019s really into paper.",
        "We did it. Youth task force forever.",
        "No, you go \u2014 okay.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Didn\u2019t you cheat on Andy?",
        "I\u2019m just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven\u2019t done anything.",
        "Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that\u2019s the end of it. Right, Pete?",
        "Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I\u2019m not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.",
        "Hello, Peter.",
        "Oh, no, I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.",
        "I guess we don\u2019t have a choice.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.",
        "Pam, phone call.",
        "He\u2019s around here somewhere.",
        "Yeah, Darryl\u2019s here. So is Santa Claus. It\u2019s just a regular Thursday.  Neither guy is here. And, it\u2019s Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl\u2019s world of lies.",
        "Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I\u2019m his helper. It\u2019s so fun.",
        "Darryl. Meet\u2026 bear\u2026 ull.",
        "Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.",
        "Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much!  That guy\u2019s hilarious. He\u2019s here today.",
        "Aw, cute! So there\u2019ll be a bunch of kids.",
        "I thought that\u2019s what you were doing.",
        "Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?",
        "I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.",
        "Hey! Wanna play hookey today?",
        "We can do anything you want.",
        "I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy\u2019s coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He\u2019s been rude. He\u2019s been selfish. I think he\u2019s a big jerk. And I\u2019m breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?\u2026 I hope as a friend.",

        "Yes.  Welcome back, buddy.",
        "Me too. So much. I\u2019m so happy.",
        "I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I\u2019m still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.",
        "He only emailed me four times.",
        "Hey!",
        "Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he\u2019s gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don\u2019t want that on my hands.",
        "Fish sounds great.",
        "Really playing the scales, huh?",
        "I don\u2019t love you anymore.",
        "I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn\u2019t really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don\u2019t love you.",
        "I just said there isn\u2019t love.",
        "I guess.",
        "You got really sunburned.",
        "Ugh.",
        "You really think we can get that back?",
        "Hi.",
        "I couldn\u2019t do it.",
        "I\u2019m sorry.",
        "We\u2019re breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn\u2019t know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete\u2019s butt. It\u2019s sick.",
        "I\u2026",
        "..just have some messages for you.",
        "Well no, they\u2019re from clients.",
        "I can\u2019t. I-",

        "Just, get over it. It doesn\u2019t have to be awkward.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.",
        "Just keep walking, don\u2019t give her anything. She\u2019ll take it and run. I\u2019m Erin by the way.",

        "I don\u2019t know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do today. All right. Yeah.",
        "I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000.  We\u2019ve investigated. Every time it\u2019s been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I\u2019d like to reward you for that.  That\u2019s god for five bucks at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. Any Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.",
        "Guys?",
        "Can you two please join me in my office? Now.",
        "I don\u2019t wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.",
        "Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.",
        "Okay. That\u2019s great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.",
        "I\u2019m sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on.  Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?",
        "Are you leaving? Oh, am I\u2026 should I continue with the investigation?",
        "All right. Uh, Stan, you\u2019re up.",
        "What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And\u2026 you did it.",
        "Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?",
        "Uh, not now.",
        "Hey, guys.",
        "Sorry, didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.",
        "I\u2019m gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao.",
        "I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.",
        "That\u2019d be hilarious. Uh, \u201cJo, they\u2019re creating a hostile work environment. Stop  \u2019em.\u201d",
        "Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.",
        "Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?",
        "Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst.  You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.",
        "Good. Well, that\u2019s the spirit.",
        "And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.",
        "The alternative is termination.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right, of course!",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "Oh boy. Can you get every department head\u2019s signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?",
        "So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?",
        "That is not how it seems to me.",
        "You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.",
        "I\u2019m back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.",
        "Great.",
        "The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.",
        "At all.",
        "Pam, I don\u2019t want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it\u2019s supposed to be. Can you just admit\u2026 admit\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t want to say it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment.",
        "Will do\u2026 Can I get one of those name plates\u2026 that says Gabe Lewis?",
        "Nope.",
        "This wasn\u2019t really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.",
        "I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, \u2018My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.\u2019 I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.",
        "I\u2019ll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.",
        "In case you can\u2019t read m-m-my Poker Face\u2026  we will be reviewing our sales policies.  I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.",
        "When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they\u2019re going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.",
        "That is correct.",
        "Not here.",
        "Okay, guys, fun is fun, but-",
        "Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so\u2026 no need to  screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let\u2019s give Darryl a round of applause, as planned.",
        "Okay\u2026",
        "In the future, you need to get Michael\u2019s approval on anything before coming to me.",
        "Okay, well, obviously if it\u2019s a really, really good idea, my door is open.",
        "Ohh. Dropping bombs, right?  This really make you think, Michael?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You\u2019re right, we don\u2019t need a hat.",
        "Okay. We\u2019re going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.",
        "Okay, why don\u2019t we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.",
        "Michael, this is irresponsible.",
        "Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.",
        "Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it\u2019s another Waco.",
        "So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here\u2019s what\u2019s been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and\u2026",
        "You don\u2019t really toss the dough.",
        "Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.",
        "Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.",
        "It\u2019s a little loud\u2026",
        "Some of us are trying to have a conversation.",
        "I\u2019ll just turn the captions on.",
        "That\u2019s for the other box.",
        "Let\u2019s go ahead and wash our hands.",
        "Yep! Waste not right?",
        "Erin you don\u2019t have to\u2026",
        "Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.",
        "It\u2019s still on upstairs.",
        "See ya Oscar!",
        "What happened?",
        "How much?",
        "I\u2019ve got just the thing!  This one\u2019s called Earth Rise, on the Moon.",
        "Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn\u2019t this where you fell in love?",
        "When you\u2019re dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don\u2019t like. I wish my gym didn\u2019t allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. \u2018Cause it\u2019s policy. See what I mean?",
        "Nudity makes me uncomfortable.",
        "My gym allows it. I wish they didn\u2019t, but it\u2019s policy. So I respect it, and I just\u2013 keep a low\u2013you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.",
        "Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?",
        "Can you at least <i>try</i> to look busy?",
        "Gabe Lewis.",
        "Well, Jo\u2013",
        "Oh my God, I can\u2019t look at roaches.",
        "We just want to say how grateful we are.",
        "Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.",
        "Erin and I make great use of ours.",
        "Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we\u2019re still dating?",
        "I\u2019m not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.",
        "Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.",
        "Intercepted!",
        "Whoops.",
        "I picked out our movie. It\u2019s called \u201cSuspiria\u201d. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.",
        "Ooh.",
        "It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d scenario, where every word she\u2019s playing has a connection to her orphan past. It\u2019s possible.",
        "So, I won.",
        "Well, that\u2019s actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch \u201cWall-e\u201d.",
        "So I got us a compromise. This movie\u2019s called \u201cHardware\u201d. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It\u2019s some of what you like and some of what I like, and\u2026 married\u2026",
        "Nice guy.",
        "No no. No no no.",
        "Ok.  No no no.",
        "Ok, I\u2019m sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.",
        "Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It\u2019s either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.",
        "Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.",
        "Number two: no pop culture references.",
        "I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don\u2019t get the reference, making them feel like the other.",
        "Ok final thing, and this is a fun one: Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let\u2019s all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.",
        "Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood.  Not every day.",
        "Go get \u2019em. Start quipin\u2019.",
        "So what, no one\u2019s even gonna try?",
        "Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.",
        "Hey\u2026",
        "Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I\u2019ll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don\u2019t want to be your babysitter.",
        "\u201cDarn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat.\u201d",
        "No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn\u2019t even include the fact that they\u2019re dogs.",
        "\u201cWake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you\u2019re dreaming you\u2019re a dog on a desert island.\u2019",
        "Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?",
        "Umm\u2026 \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I\u2019m the only one here.\u201d Ha.",
        "Tasteless?",
        "More tasteless than this\u2026\u201dis that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let\u2019s pee on it.\u201d",
        "Uh, it was.",
        "\u201cOh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.\u201d",
        "\u201cI know what it smells like but I didn\u2019t roll in anything. It\u2019s from listening to all of Gabe\u2019s bull.  \u201cIsn\u2019t this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I\u2019m Gabe and I\u2019m a weirdo.\u201d",
        "\u201cGabe\u2019s mom\u2026 hmm\u2026 Gabe\u2019s mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her.\u201d",
        "And what do we have here?",
        "Come on.",
        "I dominate Valentine\u2019s Day. I practically make romance into a science.",
        "Oh, close. It\u2019s a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.",
        "Well, get to work.",
        "The puzzle is the clue.",
        "I hear them kissing all the time. It\u2019s this horrible plipping sound. You know, it\u2019s like Chinese water torture. Just\u2026 like it\u2019s coming from my own head.",
        "Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.",
        "Yes?",
        "Seeing as it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.",
        "First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you\u2019d expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.",
        "I get it. Andy\u2019s slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.",
        "They don\u2019t touch. They don\u2019t kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.",
        "Okay. So, PDAs. That\u2019s gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh\u2026",
        "Yeah, booby honking. Sure.",
        "Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking.",
        "Sure. Basically, there\u2019s no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.",
        "Maybe you find your own chair.",
        "You have to cut it out.",
        "No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it\u2019s reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You\u2019re taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I\u2019ve done it, and I know the feeling.",
        "Number two: You\u2019re desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You\u2019re at an age where your sexual climaxes aren\u2019t as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.",
        "I\u2019m such a klutz!",
        "Will you marry me?",
        "First thing\u2019s first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would\u2019ve just looped back to me, so, it\u2019s cool you recognized my role here.",
        "Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That\u2019ll put you right on the shortlist for next time there\u2019s an opening.",
        "What recommendation?",
        "\u2026I\u2019m sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.",
        "What?",
        "Well, this is embarrassing, um, I\u2019m obviously really angry at Erin. It\u2019s that quarter life crisis everyone\u2019s been talking about.  Alright I\u2019m gonna go.",
        "Stay away from Erin!",
        "I\u2019m your boss!",
        "No, I\u2019m gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don\u2019t wanna get on my bad side! I\u2019ve seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!",
        "No! You go away!",
        "Walk away bitch.",
        "I need to talk to you!",
        "Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women\u2019s room.",
        "Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one.",
        "Okay\u2026",
        "I\u2019m either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy\u2019s career is destroyed.",
        "Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.",
        "320.  Just freeballin\u2019 it.",
        "Give or take.",
        "Umm, Pam?",
        "Was it Pam?",
        "Well, that\u2019s gonna be tough, because we\u2019re getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.",
        "Total brain burp.",
        "Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we\u2019re gonna get you to the restroom.",
        "Hey, Andy?",
        "Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?",
        "Are you still in love with Erin?",
        "Because I am. I need to get her back.  I can\u2019t be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?",
        "No. I don\u2019t like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?",
        "Do you promise that?",
        "No, just give me a second. I don\u2019t want anyone to know I\u2019ve been crying.",
        "I\u2019m sorry. This can\u2019t wait.",
        "Erin, I am in love with you. I don\u2019t believe in much, okay? I don\u2019t believe in horoscopes. I don\u2019t believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don\u2019t believe in God.",
        "Or maybe there\u2019s a God. I don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s just not a guy with a long white beard.  Or it could be. I mean, it\u2019s possible that that is exactly what \u2013 what God is. But for all of the disbelief  I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum  out\u2026 there\u2026 uh, do we not have voicemail?",
        "Well\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026  it messes up my rhythm.",
        "I can\u2019t reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.",
        "No! We really shouldn\u2019t be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.",
        "I\u2019m gonna keep trying Jo.",
        "Hey, guys.",
        "Hope I\u2019m not interrupting anything.",
        "Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?",
        "I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.",
        "No, I was not.",
        "Yep.",
        "Well\u2026 it\u2019s an interview, and we don\u2019t know that you really have the plan.",
        "How would we know that, if you don\u2019t\u2026",
        "Okay, I-I am, I\u2019m almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position.  Do you, um, do you think that you are?",
        "No.",
        "Oh? Uh\u2026 we haven\u2019t started the interview yet. Were you\u2013were you joking?",
        "Whoa! That\u2019s a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.",
        "Well, Toby\u2019s in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby\u2019s done a fine job.",
        "I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he\u2019s a rat, and I think he\u2019s responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,\u2026 he broke up the happiest couple in this office!",
        "How many windows are there in New York City?",
        "Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.",
        "No\u2026 How far away is the Sun?",
        "Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN!",
        "Great!  Um, can we just\u2026",
        "We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so\u2026",
        "What do you want me to say? I mean, there\u2019s a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England.  Are we all just gonna pretend to\u2013 okay.  Um, what are your weaknesses?",
        "A little un-specific.",
        "How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, that\u2019s not gonna be\u2026",
        "All right.",
        "I have no idea.",
        "Very unprofessional, \u201cJacques.\u201d Or, should I say, Dwight.",
        "How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability.",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "Oh, Jo. Jo, I\u2019m disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was\u2026",
        "That sounds like a promotion!",
        "Gotta catch a plane.",
        "Oh, well I\u2019m still the corporate liaison to the branch.",
        "Okay, you know what, you don\u2019t need to make that sound.",
        "There are plenty of people who love touching me.  I\u2019m a terrific hugger. I\u2019ve been with a bunch of girls where that\u2019s basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Corporate wants me up here, Dunder Mifflin wants me down there. What they worked out is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday I\u2019m here in Scranton, Tuesday Thursday I\u2019m in Tallahassee, I mean I feel like Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air, you know? More money more problems. Although, I didn\u2019t get a raise, so you know. Same money, more problems.",
        "My entire childhood, I was the one left out, and I said to myself: Gabe, if you just achieve some success, you\u2019ll be part of them. You\u2019ll be part of the happy ones. But instead, people just used my success as a new way to shut me out.",
        "I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don\u2019t steal my business strategies, and I won\u2019t dress like my life is just one long brunch?",
        "I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley\u2019s mistress?",
        "I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,\u2026",
        "To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you\u2026",
        "And I overheard, and thought, hey, that\u2019d be fun, don\u2019t mind if I do.",

        "Almost, Kevin.",
        "Math is hard.",
        "And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head.",
        "Oh, thanks. I should check that out.",
        "Actually, I\u2019m a lesbian.",
        "I\u2019m not a lesbian. I don\u2019t know why I said that\u2026 It\u2019s a joke.",
        "There is no joke. I just said it because I haven\u2019t had much luck lately and I\u2019m not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.",
        "Um, I\u2019m gonna head back to my work area and just\u2013",
        "I knew that. OK, bye.",
        "Oh, fancy meeting you here.",
        "Wikka wikka wikka what?",
        "You\u2019re shaking. Are you all right?",
        "Hey, Oscar. Who\u2019s that woman in Michael\u2019s office with the feet?",
        "Oh, she\u2019s very beautiful.",
        "So, listen, I don\u2019t know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.",
        "No! You do not talk to him like that!",
        "He is not an idiot!",
        "He is mentally challenged. But he\u2019s doing a super job here.",
        "Well, no. Dwight\u2026",
        "I\u2019m sorry.",
        "I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?",
        "Obesity-caused illnesses.",
        "That\u2019s so lame they didn\u2019t invite us.",
        "Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.",
        "It\u2019ll probably be a total disaster, but\u2026",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, that\u2019s sweet. Wish me luck.",
        "It\u2019s kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we\u2019re not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.",
        "Ok, let\u2019s just all try and work harder, ok?",
        "Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he\u2019s cute, right?",
        "What\u2019s wrong?",
        "Dieting\u2019s only half of it.",
        "And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.",
        "\u201c\u2026or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting\u2014\u201c",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Oh, I had a good time, but it\u2019s been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so\u2026",
        "I just got off\u2026 Kendall?  I just got off\u2026",
        "Oh, no.",
        "No.",
        "And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?",
        "Thanks.  That\u2019s sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.",
        "Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That\u2019s all that really matters.",
        "So we\u2019re only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it\u2019s a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.",
        "I\u2019m calling it.  I guess that\u2019s curtains for the yoga guy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Aww man, I really wanted to see them.",
        "Look at where my seats were.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Michael, you don\u2019t have to buy them.",
        "Ok.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay, great.  I got it.",
        "Pencils down!  Just kidding, take your time.",
        "Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I\u2019m going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It\u2019s gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it\u2019s not.  I have to read from the binder.",
        "Thanks Michael.  Today we\u2019re going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.",
        "Let\u2019s start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.",
        "Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.",
        "Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.",
        "Yes, it\u2019s called time theft, and it\u2019s the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?",
        "Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.",
        "Well, I just have to get through the binder.",
        "I am?",
        "Ok.  Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let\u2019s just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That\u2019s not right.",
        "No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It\u2019s part of the ethics thing.",
        "Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.",
        "What was the dilemma?",
        "Oh\u2014 no no no.",
        "No\u2014 I, I\u2019d like to hear more about that.",
        "Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there\u2019s also an exchange of goods.",
        "Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.",
        "I mean all of you have done things I wouldn\u2019t have done myself but Meredith\u2019s actions are really over the line.",
        "So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?",
        "No, it\u2019s not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?",
        "What I don\u2019t understand is\u2026 why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?",
        "Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I\u2019ve never heard of anyone who\u2019s kept their job after something like this.",
        "It\u2019s Mike-raculous.",
        "Sounds good.",
        "Oh I already bought this\u2026",
        "So, I\u2019ve gone over corporate policy.",
        "Oh, it\u2019s very nice.",
        "Mmm.",
        "In Summer.",
        "Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.",
        "Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don\u2019t think there is any way I can write a report that doesn\u2019t end with her being terminated.",
        "I\u2019m from da future.",
        "Well, that\u2019s very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.",
        "We punish her?",
        "I don\u2019t think we could enforce that.",
        "A chastity belt.",
        "No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.",
        "What am I saying?",
        "I\u2019m saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don\u2019t think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.",
        "It\u2019s not a family.  It\u2019s a workplace.",
        "It\u2019s been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won\u2019t even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.",
        "Can I sit?",
        "Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.",
        "Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.",
        "Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I\u2019m just not happy about the way we are getting it.",
        "No, I understand.",
        "No.  I can do it.",
        "Can I have everyone\u2019s attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone\u2019s attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.",
        "Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.",
        "In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.",
        "Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.",
        "Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?",
        "Ahoy.",
        "Good.",
        "Of course. Yeah.",
        "You OK?  You seem kind of\u2026",
        "I can imagine.",
        "Oh, I think she\u2019s on a sales call.",
        "Waaa! More paper! Waaa!   No, she\u2019s just on a coffee break.",
        "She\u2019s with Angela.",
        "You still gonna be mean to me?",
        "Yes.",
        "Did she really just have a baby? She\u2019s so beautiful.",
        "I\u2019m starting to get a feeling for what life was like around here for Toby.",
        "I know.",
        "Really?",
        "Hello.",
        "Yeah, it was nice.",
        "Oh, that would be great. You need that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It would help.",
        "No, he didn\u2019t.",
        "Um, tonight, I\u2019m free tonight. Is that too eager?",
        "I don\u2019t care, free tonight.",
        "Oh, I just remembered, I can\u2019t tonight.",
        "I\u2019m going out with you.",
        "No more.",
        "No more.",
        "Thank you, you too.",
        "Oh, the mall could be fun.",
        "We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.",
        "\u2026Hell yeah.",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s good.",
        "It\u2019s time to go.",
        "You\u2019re crazy, go crazy.",
        "Oh, I forgot my keys.",
        "Yeah, lets go grab them.",
        "Oh, after vous.",
        "I didn\u2019t forget my keys, I just didn\u2019t want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?",
        "Oh, good.",
        "Can I talk to you for a second?",
        "That wasn\u2019t us, right? I mean\u2026 you remembered to lock the doors?",
        "Michael I think this is our fault.",
        "Oh\u2026",
        "How\u2019s everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.",
        "Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.",
        "He knows how to get things. He got me.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it\u2019s all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.",
        "Oh, look at all this stuff! It\u2019s only seven hours.",
        "Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.",
        "Breaker one-nine, copy?",
        "Kidding.",
        "It\u2019s been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you quit and get some job in Nashua?\u201d And he said \u201cI asked you first.\u201d  And I said \u201cFirst!\u201d at the same time he did. And then I said \u201cJinx.\u201d And then we never talked about it again and haven\u2019t been back to the conversation. So\u2026",
        "I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!",
        "Yeah it did look shorter on the map-",
        "You were sleeping?  You were talking before.",
        "We\u2019re only halfway?",
        "Let\u2019s check there.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please?",
        "It\u2019s not gonna work.",
        "There\u2019s too much distance.",
        "Michael we\u2019ve only been dating each other for a few weeks",
        "And I like you too.",
        "I\u2019ve dated four guys last year too.",
        "Oh.",
        "Michael. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t make it harder than it has to be.",
        "If you leave on Friday, by five, you\u2019ll be rolling in at\u2026 midnight? At best?",
        "And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.",
        "Oh.",
        "Well-",
        "How long could we keep that up?",
        "Years?",
        "Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?",
        "Thank you.",
        "I do, I think so.",
        "You\u2019ll be okay",
        "You will.",
        "Okay. Bye.",
        "Well, I\u2019ll be around.",
        "It\u2019s not that bad. But if I\u2019m really jonesing to see you guys, I can always fly.",
        "Well, I just want to say goodbye.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Um, yeah, that\u2019s not gonna happen.",
        "No, we\u2019re gonna do the long-distance thing.",
        "Yeah, thanks.",
        "Oh, well\u2026.look, we could always call, or email, or write. I should get all your email addresses.",
        "It\u2019s a little sad. Michael and I just started dating. He wants me to stay and get a job around here as a baker. Or a baker\u2019s helper.",
        "No, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re grabbing.",
        "Put\u2026.okay\u2026.",
        "Sorry, Darryl.",
        "All right.",
        "Were there even cows where you grew up?",
        "No, Michael. It\u2019s not a real game.",
        "Darryl\u2026.",
        "No, you.",
        "You are.",
        "You are more.",

        "Snuggles.",
        "Spooning.",
        "Mmm hmm.",
        "Ooh!",
        "We could stay in a cozy B&amp;B with a fireplace?",
        "Mmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, Michael. I don\u2019t\u2026. I\u2019m gonna puke!",

        "I know, but from seven hours away.",
        "Michael\u2026.",
        "I\u2019m an atheist. Did you know that? I don\u2019t know your religion. There are so many conversations that we haven\u2019t even had yet.",
        "Oh, it\u2019s just later.",
        "This is me here.",
        "Oh no, I see they\u2019re letting just anybody in here.",
        "All right.",
        "Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?",

        "Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!",
        "Ooh, yes please.  Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?",
        "Do you have a script for the sketch, or\u2026",
        "Crystal cool.",
        "We could do Back to the Future.",
        "We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time\u2026 fix their parents.",

        "Oh.",

        "For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?",
        "That is correct!  How did you know that?!",
        "Nice campus. Think you\u2019ll get in?",
        "I\u2019m Robert Dunder.",
        "Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!",
        "That is correct!",
        "The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!",

        "How did you know that?!",
        "They didn\u2019t know?",
        "Hindsight.",

        "There weren\u2019t any laughs.",
        "Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.",

        "Would you put those out?",
        "Oh, it\u2019s so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It\u2019s like a party for limousine drivers.",
        "Oh, it\u2019s fabulous. I love what you did.",

        "Mmhmm.",
        "Why?",
        "That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn\u2019t seen any of the Toy Story movies.",
        "No. I know. I was like, \u201cWhat? Are you serious?\u201d",
        "Get a life!",

        "Who did this? It\u2019s obvious to me I\u2019m not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I\u2019m leaving.",
        "You think this is funny?",
        "Michael, you have to let this go. I\u2019m with someone else. I don\u2019t feel that way anymore.",
        "You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I\u2019d get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?",
        "Michael, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "You guys, it wasn\u2019t my fault.",

        "Oh, okay, get ready for this. You\u2019re not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.",

        "Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?",
        "Oh, wow\u2026 you went together?",
        "Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year\u2019s deadline, but um, it came and went\u2026 and, we\u2019re still together.",
        "It just wasn\u2019t fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we\u2019re going to be just fine. Just fine.",
        "Yes, Michael?",
        "What\u2019s up?",
        "Oh, no, Michael, I don\u2019t want to talk about it with you. I mean, I\u2019m fine, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "We\u2019re gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine\u2026 just fine\u2026 just fine\u2026 just fine\u2026",

        "Don\u2019t you have a sales call to go on?",
        "We don\u2019t know that.",
        "Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?",
        "Michael, I can\u2019t keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I\u2019m working with. Well, you can understand that.",
        "Well you don\u2019t have to agree.",
        "No you don\u2019t.",

        "Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that\u2019s all.",

        "So we kiss occasionally.",
        "Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.",
        "Oh, no. Michael, I don\u2019t want to make people uncomfortable.",
        "Yeah, but if they\u2019re uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.",
        "Okay.",
        "Two people in love?",

        "At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I\u2019m looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but\u2026 ok?",
        "Ohhh, God.",
        "Period.",
        "Do we understand each other?",
        "Okay, let me make something clear. As embarrassing as this is, I feel that it needs to be said. There is nothing romantic or sexual going on with Michael and myself.",
        "The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that\u2019s it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it\u2019s just not true, okay? It\u2019s not true. So\u2026 Is everyone straight on that?",
        "Never for me always means never, ever, ever.",
        "What?",
        "What did you say, Michael?",
        "Did you call my ex?",
        "Gould, you said, Gould.",
        "How dare you, Michael? My personal life is off-limits to you.",
        "Okay, how dare you do that?",
        "Why would he do that? Why would he call you, Michael? Why would my husband call you?",
        "I mean\u2026",
        "Hello, Michael.",
        "Can we come in?",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Brenda.",
        "Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?",
        "A booze cruise? What do you mean?",
        "Michael, we discussed the IRS\u2019s regulations.",
        "Okay, this event has to have legitimate business content to be tax deductible.",
        "We discussed that.",
        "Good. This is Brenda Matlow from corporate training.",
        "I thought she could attend tonight, and if your event is appropriate, you could give it to other branches.",
        "Brenda.",
        "Okay, you know, I\u2019m gonna go now, and\u2026",
        "Good luck, Brenda.",
        "Okay, see you later. And try to be professional.",
        "No, that\u2019s all right.",
        "You call me if you need anything, Brenda.",
        "So, I\u2019m happy to be here.  It\u2019s very nice to see all of you. You\u2019re all looking well.",
        "Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So\u2026",
        "Michael\u2026 I thought we agreed you wouldn\u2019t be here.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Michael.",
        "Michael.",
        "You are not allowed in this session.",
        "Now you\u2019re really not allowed in this session.",
        "I\u2019m your boss.",
        "We\u2019re fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.",
        "Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I\u2026 I\u2026 really apologize.",
        "Yes, Pam?",
        "Michael!",
        "So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They\u2019re called\u2026 anyone?",
        "I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing here, Michael,",
        "\u2026 but it\u2019s very destructive.",
        "Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?",
        "Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.",
        "I\u2019m so sorry about that\u2026 um\u2026 so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?",
        "Please? Thank you. very much.",
        "Why don\u2019t we go around the table and all say something that we know we\u2019re good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.",
        "Great. Phyllis?",
        "No. Okay. Stop. Go on\u2026",
        "That is an excellent goal.",
        "Great! Uh-huh?",
        "Well, I\u2019ll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there\u2019s any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.",
        "Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?",
        "You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.",
        "Well, it\u2019s only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I\u2019m sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.",
        "There are always a million reasons not to do something.",
        "All right. Let\u2019s talk about clothing.",
        "Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.",
        "Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I\u2019m sure that all of you have felt that before\u2026",
        "What? A union! What\u2026",
        "I\u2019m not\u2026",
        "The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think\u2026 the\u2026 pros\u2026 are\u2026 here?",
        "You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.",
        "That\u2019s too bad.",
        "I don\u2019t want to\u2026",
        "Michael! Michael! Michael!",
        "Michael.",
        "Don\u2019t say another word.",
        "Get yourself down stairs.",
        "Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a \u2026 many women ask to go over it. So\u2026 Fumble means\u2026",
        "Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait\u2026 that should mean better, that doesn\u2019t make sense.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "I don\u2019t know what Michael was talking about. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Kelly, I don\u2019t know what Michael\u2019s talking about.",
        "I\u2019m divorced.",
        "It was. Yes.",
        "I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.",
        "Okay. Let\u2019s take five. I think we can all use five.",
        "Did you take care of the situation?",
        "Excuse me.",
        "Excuse me. I\u2019ve been told there\u2019s been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he\u2019s not a friend of yours because he didn\u2019t tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that . They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to\u2026 to Michael.",
        "Josh Porter, Stamford.",
        "And Michael Scott, Scranton.",
        "Fine Michael. Thank you.",
        "Nervous, no I\u2019m not nervous. Well, I guess I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I\u2019m very nervous.",
        "OK.  Craig,",
        "Um, I\u2019m sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?",
        "Craig, you realize that we\u2019re trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?",
        "Well, the point is, is that doesn\u2019t exactly bode well for your branch.",
        "NO, NO I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not, I just\u2026 I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we\u2019re all gonna get fired.",
        "Yeah, Michael \u2013 the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just  can\u2019t believe that you told everybody and we didn\u2019t even sleep together.",
        "Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It\u2019s over. Do you understand?",
        "Surely, you cannot be serious?",
        "Uh, that\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s just forget it.",
        "Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.",
        "Oh, no, it\u2019s OK.  So, uh, Happy valentine\u2019s Day.",
        "Oh.",
        "Hello, Michael.",
        "I\u2019m\u2026 returning your call, you said it was urgent.",
        "Well, today\u2019s not my birthday, so\u2026",
        "\u2026Happy birthday, Michael.",
        "Am I on camera?",
        "Michael, I\u2019m gonna get going. I really don\u2019t think I need to be in this meeting.",
        "Yeah, but\u2026 Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.",
        "Michael?",
        "You know that I\u2019m very serious here.",
        "What?",
        "I thought that you were their fearless leader.",
        "I think you can handle it.",
        "I think so, Michael\u2026",
        "Goodbye, Michael.",
        "Michael?",
        "You know, I\u2026 I thought about it and you are right.",
        "I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.",
        "Incidentally, what is the charity?",
        "Okay, then. I will see you tonight.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "Michael?",
        "Hi.",
        "What are you\u2026 Just\u2026 Wait, what\u2019re you talking about?",
        "No. No, you didn\u2019t. Hi, I\u2019m Jan. I\u2019m Michael\u2019s boss.",
        "Does anyone want a drink?",
        "Okay.",
        "Cosmopolitan, please.",
        "Well, it\u2019s part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So\u2026 Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been\u2026",
        "Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.",
        "Oh, me too. Me too.",
        "What?",
        "No, I\u2026",
        "I didn\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026",
        "Smoke?",
        "Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.",
        "Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed",
        "Why did I hook up with Michael?",
        "It was very late, Jim. Very\u2026 Very late and\u2026 Have you given any more thought to the transfer?",
        "Good. Have you told anyone?",
        "Well, you should.",
        "Hey. I\u2019m leaving.",
        "So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.",
        "And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.",
        "Nice to meet you.",
        "And you guys have a good time together.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, it\u2019s amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.",
        "That\u2019s not what it\u2019s called.",
        "Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.",
        "NO!",
        "No, it\u2019s not possible.",
        "You know, imagine\u2026 you were gay.",
        "Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?",
        "Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?",
        "Heaven help us.  Specifically.",
        "<i>Specifically</i>, Michael.",
        "Are you on the toilet, Michael?",
        "Well, I know sometimes you are and\u2026 that you wouldn\u2019t tell me, so I\u2019m just going to assume that you are, and call me back when you\u2019re finished.",
        "Oh, hey!",
        "We all checked in?",
        "Great, let\u2019s dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.",
        "Okay!",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Step away from me, Michael.",
        "Great!",
        "What have you generated, Michael?",
        "What party?",
        "Michael, um\u2026 Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can\u2019t stay on top of you 24/7.",
        "Really?",
        "Well, Michael, I underestimated you.",
        "Josh, um\u2026  Why don\u2019t you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.",
        "A quick drink?",
        "Great!",
        "Hello?",
        "Hello?",
        "How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?",
        "Magically?",
        "No.",
        "Hello?",
        "Who is this?",
        "You should talk to Michael, and he\u2019ll talk to me, and that way we don\u2019t have to speak to each other.",
        "What about him?",
        "It\u2019s not about a surprise party is it?",
        "Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I\u2019m not coming back.",
        "How do you know I like that store?",
        "How do you know that?",
        "No it\u2019s not.  It\u2019s officially not.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Really?",
        "Ok.",
        "What would you do differently?",
        "Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael\u2019s back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.",
        "Where is it?",
        "Michael.",
        "I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.",
        "No, it wasn\u2019t.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You can\u2019t have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.",
        "Hey, Jim?",
        "How\u2019s work going?",
        "Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You\u2019ll get a big kick out of it.",
        "So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.",
        "Michael, Ed died over the weekend.",
        "I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?",
        "Well, what would you suggest?",
        "Of Ed?",
        "I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s realistic.",
        "No, that\u2019s not\u2014",
        "What the hell are you two talking about?",
        "You know what, Michael?  I\u2019ve really tried with you today\u2026",
        "\u2026and I have to get back to work.",
        "So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.",
        "Goodbye.",
        "Ed Truck died over the weekend.",
        "Yeah. And I know\u2026 I know he was your boss, so I thought you should know.",
        "Yes, they know, Michael.",
        "I guess, yes. I think it would be appropriate for you to make an announcement to your team, in case they want to pay their respects.",
        "Good.",
        "Tell me what you did yesterday.",
        "Nothing?",
        "I don\u2019t care how your day was Michael.",
        "Tell me what you did yesterday.",
        "Hi, Pam.",
        "I\u2019m great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?",
        "Thanks Pam.",
        "What I want, Michael, is an hour-by-hour log of how you spend your work time.",
        "Zoning out?",
        "If you can account for your time\u2026",
        "\u2026then maybe corporate can justify your salary.",
        "Michael, what is this about you letting everyone leave work early today?",
        "What is Diwali?",
        "Yes.",
        "Mich\u2014",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yes, of course, I know Kelly.",
        "I thought she was Muslim.",
        "Well, I think it sounds lovely. I think it sounds like a good idea.",
        "Yes, of course. It\u2019s important to celebrate our company\u2019s rich diversity. And, and in fact, Michael, if you had planned better, we might have been able to charter a bus to the event\u2014",
        "\u2014or, or, or been a sponsor for the party itself.",
        "Hey, one person is an integral part of the fabric\u2014",
        "Michael.",
        "Michael.",
        "Michael.",
        "I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.",
        "The board voted last night to close your branch.",
        "The board\u2019s.",
        "I\u2019m very sorry. I don\u2019t relish telling you this. You\u2019ve been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.",
        "A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.",
        "Well, we haven\u2019t made final decisions about personnel yet. But you\u2019re a severance package person.",
        "Well, it\u2019s not all about numbers, Michael.",
        "It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s about talent.",
        "Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company\u2019s future.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, good. You\u2019re both here. Ready to talk logistics?",
        "So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you\u2019ll be his number two.",
        "Awesome.",
        "Wha\u2026 excuse\u2026 why not?",
        "Today?",
        "You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?",
        "Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I\u2026",
        "I\u2019m gonna make some calls.",
        "So\u2026 we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.",
        "And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Michael.",
        "Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.",
        "Where\u2019s Michael?",
        "Wha\u2026 what\u2019s going on here?",
        "Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I\u2019m sure there is a better way to do this but I\u2019ve drive something like 400 miles today and I\u2019m completely exhausted so I\u2019m just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.",
        "Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is\u2026 and tell him.",
        "Back?",
        "Uh, we don\u2019t know. Probably. A few.",
        "Michael!",
        "Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?",
        "Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?",
        "You do?",
        "What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.",
        "He\u2019s the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.",
        "When did the check come?",
        "Okay, that\u2019s when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.",
        "Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I\u2019m not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.",
        "\u2026Okay it\u2019s someone named Martin Nash.",
        "Michael?",
        "Hello everyone. Hello Michael.",
        "I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.",
        "Very sunny. Family\u2019s important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.",
        "Why am I here, Michael?",
        "In the last year, I\u2019ve gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not\u2026 communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?",
        "I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means\u2026 lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.",
        "This is the kind of thing, you know? I am\u2026 attracted to you. I, I don\u2019t know why, I\u2026 but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that\u2019s what Dr. Perry thinks.",
        "This is the point, OK? You\u2019re wrong for me. In\u2026 In\u2026 every way. But I still find myself wanting to\u2026 be with you.",
        "Good, good.",
        "Well, good, OK. Thank you\u2026 for taking the time\u2026",
        "Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.",
        "Oh, God.",
        "Oh yeah, Arizona\u2019s beautiful. Yeah. It\u2019s great to\u2026 great to see my sister.",
        "Oh, yeah, I know. I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t normally lay out in the sun a lot, but, you know, when it\u2019s Scottsdale\u2026 I was visiting my sister and\u2026",
        "Dwight\u2019s name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don\u2019t know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote \u201cBeeswax. Not yours, Inc.\u201d",
        "Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?",
        "Okay.",
        "Uh when, when did, when last night?",
        "You went to a bachelor party at work?",
        "I\u2019m closer to firing you.",
        "I\u2019ll talk to you later.",
        "Michael?",
        "Hi.",
        "Let\u2019s just blow this party off.",
        "Am I on speaker phone?",
        "Is anybody else in the\u2026",
        "Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.",
        "Ok. Let\u2019s just go to a motel\u2026",
        "\u2026and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.",
        "Still on speaker?",
        "Are camera\u2019s there?",
        "See you soon.",
        "I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It\u2019s a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.",
        "You realize this is a legal document that says you can\u2019t sue the company.",
        "I\u2019ve never told you that I love you.",
        "I am taking a calculated risk. What\u2019s the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.",
        "What\u2019s this over the \u201ci\u201d?",
        "Why is this so hard? That\u2019s what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?",
        "Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.",
        "Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?",
        "From the Scranton Branch.",
        "David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.",
        "We\u2019re good.  Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?",
        "Martini please.",
        "You ok?",
        "It\u2019s nice.",
        "I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.",
        "I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.",
        "Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just.",
        "Don\u2019t you know what I\u2019m doing?",
        "Shut up.",
        "Come on.",
        "What?",
        "Just let me loosen my dress.",
        "Michael.",
        "Slam me up against the wall, right here.",
        "Oh, please.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m acting inappropriate? Get out.",
        "Not too good.",
        "I feel sick.",
        "No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.",
        "Please don\u2019t cry.",
        "It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.",
        "I didn\u2019t mean it. I was\u2026",
        "Tired. I\u2019m tired. And I didn\u2019t eat enough. And, and, that\u2019s all. That was it.",
        "That\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t mean it. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m just saying I didn\u2019t mean it.",
        "Ok.",
        "I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I\u2019ve made some decisions that I\u2019m not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I\u2019m old enough to have a mature relationship, and that\u2019s what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.",
        "Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!",
        "Is Toby there?",
        "Ok, what\u2026 what is the situation Toby?",
        "Thank God.",
        "All right, well are you gonna take care of this?",
        "What did I tell you about \u201cyeppers?\u201d",
        "I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?",
        "Why don\u2019t we talk next month, after the quarter ends?",
        "Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?",
        "Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our\u2026 you know, situation, we\u2019re gonna need to have a third party present.",
        "Da\u2014 Darryl from the warehouse?",
        "No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.",
        "Michael, he\u2019s your branch\u2019s HR rep\u2026",
        "\u2026and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don\u2019t do it.",
        "Thank you, Hunter.  Hello.  Come in.   Ah, Okay.",
        "That\u2019s my new assistant.",
        "I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?",
        "Hi, Toby.  First\u2014  First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?",
        "Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.",
        "Oh, God.",
        "Michael\u2014",
        "Michael\u2014",
        "Okay, Michael.  Please, why don\u2019t we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.",
        "Ok, Toby, how about if you\u2026",
        "Great.",
        "What\u2019s wrong with you?",
        "Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.",
        "No, just\u2026 I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?",
        "No.  But we can offer you 12.",
        "Michael!",
        "Michael, \u2026",
        "\u2026come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.",

        "So\u2026 we\u2019re good?",
        "Oh. Hold on, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "One second. Oh! It\u2019s from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?",
        "OK.  \u201cIt\u2019s me, Michael. I\u2019m just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want\u2026\u201d",

        "I just,  I uh\u2026 I don\u2019t uh\u2026 I, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t like the way that we left things.",
        "Okay.",
        "Been good.",
        "Good.",
        "Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.",
        "After you ended\u2026 everything with us, I went on a vacation.",
        "To kinda clear my mind.",
        "It was.  Yeah, it was good.  I think I\u2019ll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.",
        "I\u2019ve made some big changes in my life and\u2026 I miss you. I want us to get back together.",
        "Ohh\u2026",

        "Thanks.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?",
        "Good luck with your interview.  Bye.",
        "Hey you!",
        "How was your interview?",
        "Yeah?",

        "Well, not exactly my job\u2026 I had a different title.",
        "Different salary.  You\u2019ll get there, don\u2019t worry.",

        "Best decision I ever made.",
        "You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever.",
        "Hey.",
        "What?",
        "So, what\u2019s Ryan doing here?",
        "He\u2019s such a snake.",
        "I hope he\u2019s gets hit with an ageism suit.",
        "Ageism? Companies they can\u2019t discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.",
        "Yes, Michael, they do.",
        "My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.",
        "Is it really that important to you?",
        "Alright.",
        "Go by yourself.",
        "Well\u2026",
        "What? No Michael!",
        "You do.",
        "Well, they both go with the carpet I\u2019ve ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.",
        "A futon\u2019s not a sofa.",
        "I know what a futon is, Michael.",
        "It costs what it costs.",
        "We have gone through this.",
        "Conniving little runt. Put him through.",
        "So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.",
        "Why? Improv? Why don\u2019t you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?",
        "You drive, I had too much wine.",
        "I didn\u2019t go.",
        "I just didn\u2019t!",
        "How was improv?",
        "You\u2019re broke?",
        "Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t get this.  I really don\u2019t.  I don\u2019t know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don\u2019t know what more to say.",
        "Yeah, what?",
        "Okay, where did he go?",
        "Well, is he coming right back?",
        "I\u2019ll be right there.",
        "Alright.",
        "Michael.",
        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won\u2019t solve anything.  You know that.",
        "Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.",
        "Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It\u2019s not that bad.",
        "Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn\u2019t have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won\u2019t even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.",
        "Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That\u2019s just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I\u2019m going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where\u2019s this train taking us?",
        "I\u2019m keeping them. I know you like them. They\u2019re kind of uncomfortable though.",
        "It\u2019s kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.",
        "I just think that\u2026",
        "Why?",
        "I think you can.  I\u2026 what?",
        "All right, well then maybe there\u2019s another way, you know?  I mean, we could just\u2026 we\u2019ll think of something else.",
        "Well\u2026 well, we will.",
        "We just will.",
        "I have some ideas.",
        "I am not going to tell you yet.",
        "Oh, yes, you will.",
        "Hi.",
        "How are you?",
        "Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?",
        "Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.",
        "So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?",
        "Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?",
        "Alright, well, let\u2019s go then, I say upstairs.",
        "Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we\u2019re still a work in progress here.",
        "This is my office.",
        "Not super exciting.",
        "And this is my workspace.",
        "I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re the same with your doodles.  Smell.",
        "Uh-huh, Bonfire.",
        "Men love this one.",
        "When I get frustrated, or irritated or\u2026 angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.",
        "Just like that.",
        "So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.",
        "Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.",
        "Shame on you.",
        "See, he fits perfectly.",
        "It\u2019s pine.",
        "Really?",
        "I bet you are.",
        "It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said \u201cHoney keep the trophies.\u201d",
        "Oh, excuse us just a second.",
        "So glad you\u2019re finally able to be here.",
        "Oh, how thoughtful.",
        "Aw.",
        "How \u2019bout we do the short tour and then I\u2019ll start dinner?",
        "Oh no no no, it\u2019s just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.",
        "You know Pam, in Spain they often don\u2019t start eating until midnight.",
        "Do you have a preference, upstairs first?",
        "Follow me.",
        "So music, should we turn some music?",
        "Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.",
        "Well I think he\u2019s probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.",
        "Joe Camel!",
        "Oh!",
        "Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?",
        "No.",
        "I was watching Jim.",
        "No smiling.",
        "No no no, no names, no names,  no rhyming, no soundalikes.",
        "No rhyming!",
        "I\u2019m so, so sorry for the temperature in here.  The um, sliding glass door shattered. It\u2019s actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?",
        "Come on, it\u2019s a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!",
        "You are so right, you\u2019re so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.",
        "I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn\u2019t get. It\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t mind. In fact you know what, girl\u2019s trip, Angela come on. Girl\u2019s trip.",
        "Uh, not even close.",
        "You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don\u2019t have to tell you Pam.",
        "Oh well don\u2019t tell me that he\u2019s really changed since you guys dated.",
        "Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.",

        "That\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s very sturdy paper and on the back it says, \u201c100% post-consumer content.\u201d What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I\u2019m losing you.  Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don\u2019t know. Hold on one second.",
        "Do you really have to do that right now?",
        "Mr. Decker, I\u2019m sorry about that. What were you\u2026 Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks.  Hello? That\u2019s it. Perfect. So what I was saying\u2026  Hello? Thanks, Dwight.",
        "That is not the expression.",
        "This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I\u2019m not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I\u2019m pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I\u2019m getting cocky. Right?",
        "Solitaire?",
        "Six on seven.",
        "So then, why didn\u2019t you do it?",
        "Who doesn\u2019t love that?",
        "Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.",
        "You know what? I\u2019m actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.",
        "Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.",
        ": Uh, is that it?",
        "Hello? Hello?",
        "What are you watching?",
        "Really?",
        "No way. I think she likes this stuff.",
        "Yeah, you know, she\u2019s engaged, but\u2026",
        "Oh, yeah. She\u2019s hot.",
        "Mr. Decker, we didn\u2019t lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your\u2026 what\u2019s that? No, we didn\u2019t close last time. I just need your\u2026 Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That\u2019s actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don\u2019t blame you.",
        "Um\u2026 Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "We can go.",
        "That\u2019s fine.",
        "Uh\u2026 Not a bad day.",
        "Freecell.",
        "Well, I mean.",
        "Ah, good. Good luck. Doing good.",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "How embarrassing is it? That\u2019s not fair. Here\u2026",
        "Try this.",
        "Go get \u2019em.",
        "Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?",
        "I think she wasn\u2019t wearing a card.",
        "Last night on Trading Spouses, there\u2019s\u2026 have you seen it?",
        "Interesting, what\u2019s that like?",
        "Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is\u2026",
        "Gosh.",
        "That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.",
        "Yeah. I just don\u2019t think this is the kind of task, that I\u2026 am going to do. You know who would be great for this?",
        "Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.",
        "Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I\u2019d have to throw myself in front of a train.",
        "It says \u201cworkspace\u201d.",
        "If it\u2019s the same thing, then why did you write \u201cworkspace\u201d?",
        "You are not my superior.",
        "I thought it was a workspace?",
        "You cut more than you had to, didn\u2019t you?",
        "Well, why did you do that? You work here, don\u2019t you want good insurance?",
        "OK, well, if you\u2019ve never been sick, then you don\u2019t have any antibodies.",
        "OK, you know what Dwight? We can\u2019t write our diseases down for you because that\u2019s confidential.",
        "Workspace.",
        "Wait. What are you writing? Don\u2019t write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? \u2018Cause I\u2019m suffering from both.",
        "Oh, great.",
        "I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That\u2019s spontaneous dental hydroplosion.",
        "Thank you.",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "OK, whoa. \u2018Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they\u2019re fake?",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "No I didn\u2019t.",
        "Killer nanorobots?",
        "Sounds tough.",
        "Do you?",
        "Mmm hmm.",
        "Yep.",
        "Good luck.",
        "Jim Halpert.",
        "Who is this?",
        "No, you can\u2019t fire me.",
        "OK, can you hold on? I\u2019m getting the, ah, beep. ] Jim Halpert.",
        "Hey Pam! How are you?",
        "I\u2019m doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?",
        "No, not at all.",
        "I have nothing to do.",
        "Oh yeah?",
        "The mall?",
        "Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?",
        "Okay, here\u2019s uh, this is very simple. \u201cDwight\u2019s Workspace,\u201d nice.",
        "Um, this one interesting the power comes from the font in this one. \u201cSchrute Space,\u201d very medieval, very England. Um, this one\u2019s forceful, this one\u2019s very Dwight. \u201cQuiet! Dwight Schrute Working,\u201d it\u2019s good.",
        "I really heard him on that. This one\u2019s interesting I\u2019m not really sure what he meant by this. Um, \u201cDwight Schrute Privates.\u201d Tough to say.",
        "Well, it could happen. Have you ever seen the movie Outbreak?",
        "Okay. Have you ever seen the movie Sixth Sense? Maybe you are already dead.",
        "Dwight, I uh, I have something to confess.",
        "Um\u2026",
        "You\u2019re a jackass.",
        "No. Was that the hard way?",
        "Well, then why are you wasting everybody else\u2019s time interrogating them?",
        "Right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Wait, slow down.",
        "One second \u2019cause that sounds really good. Is jackass one word or two?  One, right? \u2018Cause, \u2019cause of the show, it\u2019s one.",
        "Absolutely, I do.",
        "At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.",
        "To what?",
        "And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says \u201cNo, Jim, here\u2019s a way.\u201d",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.",
        "What? No.",
        "What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I\u2019m using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.",
        "Well I\u2019m trying to. Do you see what I\u2019m doing?",
        "But listen, I\u2019m going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.",
        "All right.",
        "Yeah, what do you think that\u2019s about?",
        "I\u2019m on it.",
        "You are not going to believe this.",
        "Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.",
        "Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?",
        "Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone\u2026",
        "Toby and Kevin, they\u2019re trying to get Angela kicked off.",
        "Well, I don\u2019t know, if Kevin\u2019s in accounting, and Toby\u2019s in Human Resources and they\u2019re talking\u2026",
        "I love their sandwiches too.",
        "Their bread is very good.",
        "OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.",
        "Because we\u2019re strong, Dwight. Because we\u2019re strong.",
        "Sure, what\u2019s up?",
        "Oh no?",
        "No, will not, I\u2019m not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.",
        "That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.",
        "OK, here\u2019s the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith\u2019s birthday.",
        "I know, but it\u2019s gonna be a little tough because there\u2019s no good place to hide there.",
        "What? What?",
        "Great.",
        "Good.",
        "Wait, this isn\u2019t gonna work. The lid\u2019s open.",
        "I can\u2019t do that. You won\u2019t be able to breathe.",
        "Thank you, thank you. OK.",
        "So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?",
        "Right\u2026 That\u2019s good.",
        "Pam, he\u2019s in a box. He\u2019s downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I\u2019m serious. Go down there and work your magic.",
        "Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar\u2019s charity. What was it? 25 bucks?",
        "Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It\u2019s gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So\u2026 God, I can\u2019t even calculate what you\u2019re gonna have to give.",
        "OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.",
        "OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and\u2026 \u2026 spy on our other branch. No no no.",
        "But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.",
        "If we can get him to drive to Connecticut\u2026 and put peroxide in his hair\u2026",
        "No, no, dude, no.",
        "No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.",
        "God, I don\u2019t even, I don\u2019t even know how to explain this. Uh, um\u2026 Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um\u2026 um\u2026 we were\u2026 we\u2019ve just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um\u2026",
        "It\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s, it\u2019s just office pranks.",
        "No thanks.",
        "No one wants to be you, Dwight.",
        "Is your password Frodo?",
        "Did you just change it to Gollum?",
        "Hey Dwight, my tuna sandwich isn\u2019t in the refrigerator. You wouldn\u2019t know anything about that would you?",
        "It was not rotting.",
        "Stop. Dwight, stop.",
        "Dwight, you wrote that memo. Okay, it\u2019s not an official memo.",
        "Dwight, it\u2019s not a factory at all. Do you have to do what you are doing?",
        "Because we\u2019re strong, Dwight. Because we\u2019re strong. God, it\u2019s freezing, I gotta go in. You stay though for like five minutes.",
        "You don\u2019t want to arouse suspicion.",
        "Good. I like it. You know what. Pretend to smoke.",
        "God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I\u2019ve ever seen go to someone\u2019s head. Phyllis, can you believe this?",
        "Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set\u2026 and that was three years ago.",
        "That\u2019s him.",
        "Uh, I heard it.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "I\u2019ll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and\u2026",
        "Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I\u2019m, yeah, I\u2019m looking forward to playing. You know, I think I\u2019m gonna impress a few people in here.",
        "You coming down?",
        "You gonna wish me luck?",
        "Whoa.",
        "Is that trash talk from Pam?",
        "Oh.",
        "Well, I\u2019m going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I\u2019m also competitive, you should feel free to come along.",
        "I think I\u2019ll see you at the mall. Yeah.",
        "Have a good game man.",
        "Really? I thought I\u2019d take Roy.",
        "My bad.",
        "You know what? Let me take Roy.",
        "Take it easy.",
        "\u2026so I talked to the scout, it looks good.",
        "I didn\u2019t sign anything.",
        "I\u2019m trying, yup.",
        "Great, thanks.",
        "Forget it. It\u2019s just a dry erase board.",
        "Okay, that\u2019s insanely complicated and the first thing I\u2019m going to do is erase it.",
        "Well, then keep it.",
        "Yeah, Michael. Go Michael.",
        "Cute, sure, yeah.",
        "She\u2019s not really my type.",
        "Hmmm, I don\u2019t think so. Nope.",
        "Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.",
        "Too late, Kev.",
        "Pam and I are good buddies.  I\u2019m sort of Pam\u2019s go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh\u2026 Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.",
        "She\u2019d be perfect for you.",
        "So, what? You\u2019re Assistant Regional Manager.",
        "Well, you know what Dwight? He\u2019s your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.",
        "Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You\u2019re both um, salesmen. I mean that\u2019s something right there.",
        "It\u2019s all gold.",
        "Alright. Here\u2019s the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.",
        "You buy a purse.",
        "Dwight, that\u2019s not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?",
        "Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them.",
        "Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.",
        "No. You don\u2019t need the bathroom. You\u2019ve got it. Go.",
        "Okay, shhhh stop\u2026 stop whatever you\u2019re doing because this is going to be good.",
        "Hi my name\u2019s Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?",
        "Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.",
        "Oh! That was really.  This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh\u2026 This is the prettiest one of all.",
        "I\u2019m going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much?",
        "Here he comes, shhh\u2026",
        "Good.",
        "He did pick a good one.",
        "A futon?",
        "He\u2019s a grown man",
        "That\u2019s sad. Or it\u2019s innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one.",
        "Hi.",
        "I\u2019m Jim, by the way.",
        "Hi Katy, nice to meet you.",
        "I do. That\u2019s what I\u2019m best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let\u2019s talk about purses.",
        "Katy but you know what, don\u2019t try to sell me one. Okay, seriously \u2019cause I\u2019m just here to learn.",
        "Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can\u2026",
        "What\u2019s up?",
        "Thank you for choosing me.",
        "Ah, well I think I\u2019m gonna see Katy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, man I don\u2019t know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.",
        "And stuff\u2026 yeah.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Okay.",
        "That\u2019s cool.",
        "That is cool. Well, I\u2019ll see you Monday though, right?",
        "Okay.",
        "Alright.",
        "Goodnight, Michael.",
        "I don\u2019t know. Grab a drink, I think?",
        "I got this.",
        "I got it.",
        "Have a good night.",
        "Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it\u2019s lighter.",
        "Alright now, I\u2019m gonna warn you. Don\u2019t freak out, okay?",
        "This is a really nice car. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.",
        "You\u2019re not going to freak out?",
        "Oh, really?",
        "Well, Pam I\u2019m not gonna lie to you, he\u2019s chances are none. Um, he\u2019s 41 years old, he is losing his hair and his cell phone ring is \u201cMambo #5.\u201d So\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t know though. I mean, you know that was a hit.",
        "Yeah, was it 10? Yeah, I have it on a mix tape from junior high.",
        "You know what, just in case she\u2019s looking you should put some stuff in it.",
        "Anything.  Good. Yup.",
        "Post-it Notes. Wow, that purse holds a lot.",
        "Yeah, oh, I know. Looks great.",
        "Oh, great thanks.",
        "So, you ready for the\u2026 the Dundies?",
        "What?",
        "Oh, I can\u2019t because I keep them hidden. I don\u2019t want to look at them and get cocky.",
        "No, it\u2019s hilarious, you\u2019re right. I just think, um, \u201cworld\u2019s longest engagement\u201d, um, we\u2019re all expecting it, you know?",
        "Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.",
        "Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.",
        "Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think those might be empty.",
        "Second drink?",
        "Yeah, alright Kev.",
        "Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.",
        "What a great year for the Dundies.",
        "We got to see Ping.   And we learned of Michael\u2019s true feelings for Ryan.  Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs.  Which for me, has ruined them for life.",
        "What?",
        "Okay.",
        "I don\u2019t know, what?",
        "Oh my God! You are so drunk!",
        "Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.",
        "He\u2019s a volunteer.",
        "Dwight come on, come-",
        "Whoa.",
        "Whoa.",
        "Whoa, careful, careful.",
        "No you don\u2019t.",
        "Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.",
        "Shoot.",
        "Not really a question.  Okay, let\u2019s get you home, you\u2019re drunk.",
        "Alright.",
        "Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.",
        "Mmm-hmmm.",
        "He plays guitar, he likes naval history. He\u2019s a bowler.",
        "Well, you seem to have this under control.",
        "The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.",
        "Good one.",
        "What award would you like to give Dwight?",
        "Okay.",
        "Dwight, this is crazy.",
        "Dwight, Dwight.",
        "The other volunteers.",
        "Hey.",
        "Um\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Oh! There it is!",
        "Um\u2026 \u2018Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.\u2019",
        "Well done.",
        "Topical.",
        "Hey, um\u2026 what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer?  This guy!",
        "Except pass that breathalyzer.",
        "I\u2019m really excited to meet your Mom.",
        "Oh yeah?",
        "Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.",
        "Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?",
        "I\u2019m in an office relationship. It\u2019s special. Um\u2026 she\u2019s nice. She\u2019s shy. She\u2019s actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a\u2026 . I told you that you\u2019d be on camera. I\u2019m sorry, she\u2019s European. No, I told you that you\u2019d be on camera. Stop it.",
        "No, thanks. I\u2019m good.",
        "Does that include \u2018That\u2019s What She Said\u2019?",
        "Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so\u2026",
        "What can I say, Dwight, I live a very dangerous life.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yes, it is harassment and I\u2019m going to be suing the winking face. I\u2019ve hired the angry face as my lawyer and you will be hearing from him pretty soon.",
        "Okay.",
        "",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "No way. Let\u2019s do this  Oh.",
        "Wind.",
        "Perfect.",
        "Oh.",
        "Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?",
        "What does 2005 season mean?",
        "Wait a minute, what is this?",
        "What?",
        "Really?",
        "Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.",
        "OH!",
        "Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.",
        "Why?",
        "Hey, do you guys have any other games?",
        "So that\u2019s what this sound is all day.",
        "Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?",
        "Fair enough.",
        "This scented candle \u2026andle \u2026andle. Which I found in the men\u2019s bathroom \u2026room \u2026room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.",
        "Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.",
        "Let the games begin.",
        "You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I\u2019m blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?",
        "Hum.",
        "Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.",
        "So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?",
        "Yes! Phyllis!  Phyllis, just put your foot right through here . Right through the flonk.",
        "Here we go.  Here we go.",
        "Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It\u2019s Phyllis!",
        "Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.",
        "Thank you, delegate from Iceland.",
        "Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.",
        "Very nicely done. I think that\u2019s H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.",
        "Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.",
        "Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?",
        "Ryan Howard. Ryan!  Gold medal.",
        "What?  Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?",
        "Alright Pam, alright . Nice work!",
        "Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15.",
        "Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come.  Guys?",
        "Nothing. Guys? Timer\u2019s still going? Er?",
        "Here you go. All done.",
        "Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.",
        "Hey.",
        "Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?",
        "Okay, today. 5 o\u2019clock. Closing Ceremonies.",
        "Notify the athletes.",
        "Michael.",
        "Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.",
        "Nice.",
        "Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.",
        "These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You\u2019re on the top one.   Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal.",
        "And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.",
        "Um\u2026 \u2018Cause your condo\u2019s in America.",
        "Those are the doves.",
        "Oh, Pam? Can I see you in here for a second? It\u2019s important, so\u2026",
        "I found Dwight\u2019s wallet in the parking lot.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what the best play is. Do we tear everything up, or do we buy a horse on the Internet? I mean, I don\u2019t know what to do. What do you think?",
        "Okay, what?",
        "Okay.",
        "Nothing.",
        "Did you just come up with that?",
        "That is good. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what it is.",
        "Wow.",
        "Oh, Somebody went in. That was a team effort, Pam.",
        "Okay.",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "Oh, okay. Oh, do\u2026 that\u2019s what the tape is for. I didn\u2019t know.",
        "Um, like stapler tennis or something like that.",
        "Okay.",
        "Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker.",
        "So we\u2019re still on for lunch? You\u2019re meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we\u2019re going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do?",
        "And, um\u2026",
        "Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.",
        "Okay, so\u2026 three books on a desert island? Angela.",
        "Nice. Third book?",
        "Okay. Phyllis.",
        "Nice.",
        "I guess.",
        "Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.",
        "Nice. Smart.",
        "Okay. Thought people read more books.",
        "DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith?",
        "Wow.",
        "Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just\u2026 .",
        "Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The\u2026 the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you\u2019re going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.",
        "Unforgivable.",
        "Good.",
        "Pam? Get us back into it.",
        "Five movies. Go ahead.",
        "Ooh, definitely in my top five.",
        "What?",
        "Okay that\u2019s five.",
        "Pam, play by the rules.",
        "Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.",
        "All right. Let\u2019s move on. Let\u2019s move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?",
        "Um, not neccessari\u2026",
        "Um\u2026 okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll finish explaining the rules. Let\u2019s\u2026 let me explain it first, and then\u2026",
        "Yeah, so we\u2019ll get right\u2026 You know what? I\u2019ll be right back. Stanley, you\u2019re taking over for me, buddy. I\u2019ll be right back.",
        "Dwight. Dwight.",
        "Come on Dwight! Use words.",
        "Who goes to business school?",
        "He does?",
        "What?",
        "You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.",
        "Yeah. You\u2019re right.",
        "Alright buddy.",
        "Nothing.",
        "Um\u2026 Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He\u2019s really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.",
        "Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We\u2019re just here, we\u2019re playing Desert Island. It\u2019s when you pick your five favorite DVDs\u2026",
        "Hey.",
        "Good, how are you?",
        "Good to see you, too.",
        "Yeah, I am too.",
        "What answers?",
        "Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on.  Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite.  Desert Island. Five movies. Go.",
        "Okay, I think the game\u2019s over\u2026 People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Sure.",
        "Oh, the best.",
        "Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.",
        "Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn\u2019t be stuck here at a paper company.",
        "Those are like my favorite movies. I didn\u2019t really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Groundhog Day.",
        "Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?",
        "Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?",
        "A semester?",
        "Wow.",
        "Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.",
        "I\u2019m a three hole punch version of Jim. \u2018Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Okay, okay\u2026",
        "Nice.",
        "Okay, okay. Um, how \u2019bout, the ultimate team player?",
        "Dwight is\u2026 special. But, I don\u2019t believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig\u2019s List. We\u2019re really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska\u2026 or India.",
        "Um. He sticks to his guns.",
        "Um\u2026 Whoa.  Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I\u2019m gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.",
        "Um\u2026 it\u2019s in Maryland.",
        "Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe\u2026 maybe I will.",
        "Honestly, I don\u2019t think Michael has the slightest clue of who he\u2019s gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone\u2019s going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what\u2019s going to happen is it\u2019s gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.",
        "Um\u2026 yes.",
        "Michael, I really didn\u2019t mean to\u2026",
        "I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Oh, you want me to be you?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, are you firing Creed?",
        "We should switch seats in order to\u2026",
        "Alright.  Excuse me. I\u2019m really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it\u2019s purely budgetary. It\u2019s not personal\u2026",
        "Wow.",
        "That\u2019s an overreaction.",
        "Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.",
        "Michael Scott here.",
        "Toby? Mm hmm.  I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth\u2026",
        "It wasn\u2019t me.",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Come on.",
        "That\u2019s just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we\u2019re friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I\u2019m gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn\u2019t blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it\u2019s double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.",
        "What\u2019s up, Hef?",
        "That is weird.",
        "Ok, well, you\u2019re the one who lost the desk.",
        "Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?",
        "I think you should retrace your steps.",
        "Colder\u2026 warmer\u2026 little warmer\u2026 there you go, ooh, warmer\u2026 warmer\u2026 warmer\u2026 warmer\u2026 warmer \u2026 cold, cold, cold, back up\u2026 ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.",
        "Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.",
        "I know.",
        "Uh, yeah, ream.",
        "Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.",
        "Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second\u2026",
        "Umm\u2026",
        "You know what, let me give you a call right back. I\u2019m going to uh, find it and then I\u2019ll call you back, thanks.",
        "Was that your mom?",
        "Oh, I thought it was your mom.",
        "Assistant to the Sensei, that\u2019s pretty cool.",
        "Ok.",
        "Uh, Larissa Halpert.",
        "117 Mount Bergin St.",
        "You making this up as you go along, aren\u2019t you?",
        "Well, at least I don\u2019t have cavities.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?",
        "No I\u2019m not.",
        "Oh, that\u2019s not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don\u2019t ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it.",
        "Ok, say please.",
        "Please?",
        "Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.",
        "Ok, Roy?",
        "Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?",
        "Well, Dwight\u2019s a purple belt, so\u2026",
        "Uh, how did you know they were black belts?",
        "Sounds tough. When you\u2019re a Jet,  you\u2019re a Jet all the way, right?",
        "I can\u2019t. I just got a manicure.",
        "Just have Dwight punch you.",
        "You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?",
        "Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?",
        "Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.",
        "Ok, I\u2019ll buy you a bag of chips.",
        "Obviously.",
        "Yes.",
        "Uh, Kitchen.",
        "Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight\u2019s dojo?",
        "Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight\u2026 Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I\u2019m coming, fight\u2026",
        "Wow, that is really interesting.",
        "Your love line- I\u2019m just kidding. I can\u2019t see anything.",
        "Oh, ok.",
        "Tied up.",
        "What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.",
        "Later, Kev.  Have a good weekend.",
        "I don\u2019t know.  He looks pretty scrappy.",
        "True. Meredith.",
        "Okay. Roy.",
        "Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?",
        "No.  They\u2019re in the conference room.",
        "So this possible client they\u2019re talking about, actually a big deal.  It\u2019s Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.   Years.",
        "No\u2026",
        "We are doing worst first dates.",
        "Wait, when was this?",
        "I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.",
        "Is this real?",
        "Agent Michael Scarn.",
        "How long is this?   Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.",
        "Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn\u2019t really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.",
        "Do we all have our copy of \u201cThreat Level: Midnight\u201d, by Michael Scott?",
        "Alright, let\u2019s get this started.  I\u2019m gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.",
        "Oh yeah-",
        "Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.",
        "Dwight-",
        "Do you want to play-",
        "The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?",
        "Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.",
        "Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-",
        "A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn.  Uh\u2026 Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?",
        "Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-",
        "That\u2019s actually a good idea.  We\u2019ll all take a brief intermission.   Hey, are you hungry?",
        "Yeah?",
        "I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I\u2019m not a complainer.",
        "Wow.",
        "Nice.  That\u2019s excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.",
        "So, I guess I\u2019ll see you in  ten hours.",
        "Travel.  I\u2019ve been looking forward to it.  It\u2019s gonna be\u2026 really nice.  Gonna find myself.",
        "Yeah.  Definitely.",
        "Jan didn\u2019t come back for her car last night.",
        "Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?",
        "No way.",
        "Some might even say that we had our first date last night.",
        "Really.",
        "Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.",
        "Dinner and a show, if you include Michael\u2019s movie.   And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.",
        "You\u2019re right, we didn\u2019t dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.",
        "Least I didn\u2019t leave you at a high school hockey game.",
        "Oh, come on, Pam.  I-",
        "Ok, we didn\u2019t dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it\u2019s not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Really?  Do you wanna get back to that?  I could go.  I should go.",
        "No, not at all.",
        "Uh hmm.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, it\u2019s just a movie, Dwigt.",
        "Just then, Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head.",
        "Another bullets heads towards Agent Michael Scarn, but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute.",
        "Yup, I guess so.",
        "No.  Thank you.",
        "Done.",
        "S\u2019ok.",
        "You\u2019re not having sex.",
        "Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?",
        "Wow.  Um, ok.",
        "Ok.",
        "We don\u2019t have double-tabbed manila file folders.",
        "No, we don\u2019t.",
        "Alright\u2026 well, I\u2019m not asking for a raise. I\u2019m gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.",
        "I win.",
        "Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?",
        "Duh.",
        "Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it\u2019s Friday.  And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be working on this afternoon.",
        "Ohh\u2026",
        "Eck!\u2026 Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it\u2019s Friday.  So, keep that goin\u2019.",
        "Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a\u2026",
        "\u2026Saturday, so just let me know what you\u2019re doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.",
        "Hey, how\u2019s it goin\u2019?",
        "Course, it\u2019s on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?",
        "No, that was unbelievable.",
        "I don\u2019t really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.",
        "Um, you don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.",
        "Oh-",
        "Yeah, no, I don\u2019t think you can.",
        "Ummm\u2026 no idea.",
        "Yes.",
        "Then why the question?",
        "I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.",
        "Really?",
        "You have a better idea?",
        "I\u2019ll use that.",
        "Yeah. You have fun?",
        "Did you go to first base?",
        "Oh, yeah?",
        "Did you go to second?",
        "Second.",
        "Okay, so close call at second. Was there an infield fly?",
        "Pop-up?",
        "Really?",
        "So, you got the signal from the third-base coach. You know what I\u2019m saying? Like if there was a fly out to deep right, you know. A runner on second. He tagged up, didn\u2019t he?",
        "Office romances. Um\u2026  I think you should probably ask Pam \u2019cause she\u2019s in an office romance, technically.",
        "Which one?",
        "He can\u2019t hear you?",
        "I know.",
        "Well, that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, my God. I left today\u2019s paper on my desk.",
        "What? Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Wow. You are very good at what you do.",
        "Are we in danger?",
        "What?",
        "Hmm\u2026",
        "No.",
        "",
        "Uh hum.",
        "It\u2019s true. I\u2019m having a party.  I\u2019ve got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn\u2019t invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it\u2019s nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn\u2019t be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I\u2019m pretty sure he thinks that I\u2019m making Dwight up.    He is very real.",
        "Oh, uh, no. Could-",
        "Could, keep that down.",
        "Because not everybody knows about the party.",
        "Umm, Michael.",
        "Because it\u2019s a surprise.",
        "Uh hmm.",
        "So, don\u2019t tell.",
        "Ok.",
        "So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.",
        "I know.",
        "Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy\u2019s gonna come, or\u2026",
        "Oh, ok, cool.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yup, it\u2019s, uh, four o\u2019clock.",
        "Oh, um\u2026 .I can\u2019t.",
        "Uh hmm, definitely.",
        "You do?",
        "Because you said \u201cdo you wanna hang out\u201d-",
        "Really?",
        "Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.",
        "Improv sounds great.",
        "Alright.",
        "I think Stanley just coughed.",
        "Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody\u2019s attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it\u2019s not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.",
        "That\u2019s because Mark\u2019s my roommate.",
        "Uh hmm.",
        "Oh, uh, later-ish.",
        "Great.   Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-",
        "Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.",
        "Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we\u2019re lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.",
        "Uh, actually, I haven\u2019t talked to her in a while.",
        "We can talk about that later.",
        "See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It\u2019s-",
        "This is my desk.",
        "My home office, this is it.",
        "Ok, sure. Will do.",
        "Yeah, that\u2026 Yep, that feels about right.",
        "You know what?  Let\u2019s just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.",
        "Yeah, you don\u2019t have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that\u2019s not gonna be awkward at all.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Angela, burger? Dog?  Havin\u2019 fun?",
        "Chicken, hot dog, burger.",
        "There is soda inside.",
        "Oh by the way how\u2019s your side project going?",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, definitely didn\u2019t need help with that, but, yeah.",
        "Oh?",
        "Uh, yeah, I guess.",
        "Yeah, no one can snap with their little finger.",
        "And in this room here, if you look closely, you will find out a few clues about who lives here.  Um, he likes biking, obviously, and uh, what else?  Uh, he likes tour guides, I guess.  And if you\u2019re very perceptive, you\u2019ll notice that he didn\u2019t do a great job of cleaning his room .  Ok, and uh, that\u2019s the tou-",
        "Um, thank you, Ryan, uh, I don\u2019t know, I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone that I like penguins, and here we are.",
        "And that\u2019s why it\u2019s on my desk, Phyllis; it means a lot to me, and now that I know it was from you, it means even more.  Moving on!  Uh, ok, so that\u2019s the end of the tour for now, and if you liked it please tell your friends: \u201cWhenever you\u2019re in Scranton, visit Casa de la Halpert\u201d.",
        "So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I\u2019m also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two.  This would take a little too long to explain, so I won\u2019t. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.",
        "I think I did a pretty good job.",
        "Well, I can\u2019t tell you cause it\u2019s a secret.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well, there\u2019s a $20 limit, right? So .. ?",
        "That\u2019s great. Well don\u2019t tell me who it is, cause I can ..",
        "Oh, cool.",
        "Great. Where did you get it?",
        "He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number  and then threw it in a bag.",
        "There\u2019s a little more to it.",
        "What is Yankee Swap?",
        "I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.",
        "Oh, shouldn\u2019t we \u2026 I bought that specifically for Pam.",
        "Sure you don\u2019t want the teapot?",
        "Right.",
        "No. No. Definitely. It\u2019s ..",
        "Got to be kidding me.",
        "Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.",
        "I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?",
        "Come on, it\u2019s a shamrock keychain. Good luck.",
        "Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?",
        "You don\u2019t even drink tea.",
        "Okay ..",
        "To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it\u2019s a little too much to handle.",
        "You know, you don\u2019t have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.",
        "But ..",
        "Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.",
        "I didn\u2019t think you were going to get that one. I really didn\u2019t.",
        "Hey.",
        "What\u2019s up, buddy?",
        "Wow, that\u2019s weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that\u2019s pretty good.",
        "Who, Steve?",
        "Oh, there it is. J1.",
        "Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.\u201d",
        "So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.",
        "Yeesh, how old is this ship?",
        "I\u2019m not really sure what movie you\u2019re talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?",
        "Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he\u2019s king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.",
        "It\u2019s not hilarious, but\u2026",
        "Um, no.",
        "Yeah.  Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!",
        "Well\u2026",
        "Oh, um\u2026",
        "Um\u2026 let\u2019s see, uh\u2026  The customer. Because the customer is king.",
        "You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.",
        "No.",
        "I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s break up.",
        "What happened to you?",
        "Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?",
        "What a night.",
        "She was always engaged.",
        "That\u2019s\u2026 great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so\u2026",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Yeah. She\u2019s really funny, and she\u2019s warm. And she\u2019s just\u2026 well, anyway.",
        "She\u2019s engaged.",
        "Huh.",
        "No, I really don\u2019t want to.",
        "Thanks, Katy. Um, didn\u2019t really prepare anything to say. We\u2019re all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she\u2019s awesome. And\u2026",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "What?",
        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "I\u2019m sorry? Pam.",
        "What is going on?",
        "Hey, whoa, Michael\u2026",
        "It\u2019s, okay, it\u2019s Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.",
        "You burned <i>your</i> foot on a Foreman Grill?",
        "Oh\u2026",
        "But you said that you went out with her this weekend.",
        "What was that\u2026",
        "Oh!",
        "He hit the pole!",
        "It\u2019s broken right, he can\u2019t\u2026",
        "Oh Dwight, Dwight,   Ohhhhhh!",
        "He\u2019s still driving\u2026 Dwight, you forgot your bumper!",
        "So, where are you shipping your foot?",
        "So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.",
        "Do you think Dwight\u2019s bein\u2019 a little weird today?",
        "And that isn\u2019t weird?",
        "Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?",
        "I want to clamp Michael\u2019s face in a George Foreman grill.",
        "You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.",
        "Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I\u2019m pretty sure he has a concussion.",
        "Fine.",
        "Slowly, slowly.  Let\u2019s just get to the elevator.",
        "What are you doing?  What, stop\u2026",
        "Stop, stop, stop, stop.",
        "You can\u2019t lay down.",
        "Wake up.",
        "I\u2019m just gonna get\u2026",
        "Just keep him awake.",
        "You don\u2019t think you should sit in the back with Dwight?",
        "Well, I think she has a kid.",
        "Come on, get inside.",
        "We\u2019re going to Chuck E. Cheese.",
        "We\u2019re going to the hospital, Michael.",
        "Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.",
        "Give the bottle to Michael",
        "Give the bottle to Michael!",
        "Will you stop?",
        "Michael stop.",
        "Michael stop.",
        "Stop",
        "It\u2019s Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.",
        "Concussion.  What did you write?",
        "So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.",
        "Come on Dwight.",
        "Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.",
        "Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.",
        "Michael went in there with him too.  It\u2019s pretty sweet.",
        "Uh huh.",
        "But they shouldn\u2019t be much longer now, so we\u2019ll be back soon.",
        "Ok.",
        "Bye.",
        "And doctors.",
        "I\u2019m gonna pull the car around.",
        "Do you speak Spanish?",
        "No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Not much what\u2019s up with you?",
        "Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?",
        "Nothin\u2019 much what\u2019s up with you?",
        "So close.",
        "Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world\u2019s worst confidant.",
        "Hey Michael.",
        "Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That\u2026 was\u2026 personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.",
        "Umm, hmm.",
        "Nobody.",
        "Alright. Great. Thank you.",
        "I\u2019m going with grape.",
        "Which one?",
        "I don\u2019t know what you mean.",
        "Uh, uh, ok.",
        "I\u2019m going to take off actually.",
        "Tony the tiger.  You don\u2019t hear that much any more.",
        "Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I don\u2019t know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.",
        "No, that\u2019s alright, thank you though. It\u2019s, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.",
        "Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let\u2019s go out. That was a good idea.  Let\u2019s go out.",
        "Nope we\u2019re not brothers.",
        "Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.",
        "Uh, I really don\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "Um, she\u2019s easy to talk to I guess and she\u2019s got a really good sense of humor.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "What about you?",
        "Wow, that\u2019s not what I meant.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks, thanks Dana.",
        "Just you know politics, literature.",
        "Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I  don\u2019t. Riveting.",
        "Hey.",
        "Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.",
        "It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.",
        "Big day.",
        "Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It\u2019s so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.",
        "Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.",
        "And seriously, it\u2019s totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.",
        "Oh you did?",
        "No, no, you saw through me, great.",
        "Oh yeah, yeah\u2026 hope that\u2019s okay.",
        "And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.",
        "Ok.",
        "Hey.",
        "Umm, what happened?",
        "Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it\u2019s, you know what. It\u2019s not a big deal.",
        "Look its one day, everything\u2019s gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?",
        "Good.",
        "Ready?",
        "Wow. Thanks.",
        "No, you what, seriously, you should have it.",
        "Oh, tomorrow, that\u2019s gonna be tough \u2019cause I already laid out my outfit, so\u2026",
        "Oh, nothing.",
        "Pam\u2019s on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it\u2019ll be nice to see her.  It\u2019ll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh\u2026 June.  Summer.  So, that\u2019ll be nice.  And that\u2019s that.",
        "Oh, nothing.",
        "Hey!  Welcome back!",
        "So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?",
        "Good!  What\u2019s goin\u2019 on here?",
        "What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.",
        "Oh.  Wow.",
        "That might be a little difficult with the one computer.",
        "But there\u2019s definitely a desk open in the back.",
        "\u2026which I guess I\u2019ll be taking.",
        "No, no, no, seriously, I\u2019ll be in the back.",
        "Hey, Kelly.",
        "Um, just for the day while Michael\u2019s at my desk.",
        "Allergy to\u2026 the desk?",
        "It\u2019s the lever on the side.",
        "No, I don\u2019t think I can\u2026",
        "Hey!",
        "Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It\u2019s actually little awkward.",
        "What do you think of Kelly?",
        "Are you interested in her?",
        "Really?",
        "She said lots of things.",
        "I have no idea.",
        "Yeah.  Sure.",
        "Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail \u2019cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh\u2026 give me a call back, I hope.  I\u2019ll talk to you later. Bye.",
        "Yep.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, just somewhere in the Poconos. I was just surfing.",
        "Just give me one second. I\u2019m just gonna grab something to eat.",
        "Hey.",
        "So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?",
        "And then you just changed desks, right?",
        "To one without a cubicle.",
        "So, you just couldn\u2019t take it anymore, huh?",
        "So, that\u2019s how it\u2019s gonna be.",
        "What is?",
        "Thanks for the head\u2019s up, Kev.",
        "Oh, no, no. No.",
        "Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.",
        "Yeah. I like talking to her too.",
        "Yes. Yeah.",
        "Yep. Cool, man.",
        "Ponies.",
        "Flowers.",
        "Hey!",
        "It\u2019s a complete\u2026 well, actually it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect, so\u2026 How are the girls?",
        "Did you really?",
        "Oh.",
        "Good.",
        "Nice. Well, what\u2019s it all about?",
        "I think you should do it. That\u2019s great!",
        "So you\u2019re not doing it.",
        "Why not?",
        "Come on.",
        "Roy said that.",
        "You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?",
        "You are?",
        "Oh, that one was good.",
        "Do you mean vibrate?",
        "Oh, that one was good.",
        "Do you mean vibrate?",
        "So I broke up with Katy and haven\u2019t been dating anybody else, so this year I don\u2019t have to worry about Valentine\u2019s Day. It\u2019s gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We\u2019re gonna play some cards and I\u2019ll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they\u2019re idiots. It\u2019s gonna be great.",
        "I dunno, it\u2019s on <i>your</i> desk.",
        "It was there when I sat down.",
        "Hey Kelly. What\u2019s up?",
        "OH, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m really happy for",
        "Wow.",
        "Wow.",
        "No, don\u2019t be.",
        "I bet.",
        "Alright.",
        "Nah that\u2019s alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That\u2019s fine. No, I didn\u2019t even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.",
        "Take it slow. \u2018Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need\u2026",
        "Oh, no, not while I\u2019m here.",
        "You know what? Here\u2019s the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It\u2019d be great, but he isn\u2019t.",
        "Well, he\u2019s not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.",
        "Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.",
        "Animalian?",
        "Why?",
        "You\u2019re writing something?",
        "Okay.",
        "No, I\u2019m not gonna do that.",
        "But I know how to spell it.",
        "Only if you tell me what you\u2019re writing.",
        "So now you\u2019re writing two things?",
        "Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so\u2026 I guess there really is someone for everybody.",
        "Can we not?",
        "Still want that.",
        "Cugino\u2019s pizza.",
        "Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so\u2026",
        "What did I do to deserve this?",
        "No.",
        "Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.",
        "Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?",
        "I\u2019m going to take a trip. I\u2019m going to get out of town for a while\u2026 and go someplace\u2026 not here.",
        "Where do I want to go? Um\u2026 that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um\u2026",
        "Can I go?",
        "So. Uh\u2026 I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I\u2019m going yet. It\u2019s kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?",
        "What is that?",
        "I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.",
        "When did you go there?",
        "Really for like how long?",
        "Where do I want to go?",
        "No. We\u2019re not.",
        "Which means absolutely nothing.",
        "Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?",
        "Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.",
        "You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.",
        "Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you\u2019ve got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.",
        "The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.",
        "You\u2019ve got to wave your arms and you\u2019ve got to pound your fists. Many times. It\u2019s supposed to emphasize your point.",
        "Ok, I didn\u2019t actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history\u2019s famous dictators. Like this one . Originally given by Benito Mussolini.",
        "Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own <i>but</i> I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don\u2019t mind.",
        "Maybe. Thanks.",
        "Yeah. I\u2019m definitely going.",
        "I\u2019m going. I\u2019m a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that\u2026 um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but\u2026",
        "I\u2019m\u2026 leaving on June 8th.",
        "Yeah. And I\u2019m really sorry about that, I just\u2026",
        "Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?",
        "Alright.",
        "Goggles?",
        "Bribery. Nice.",
        "The ocean.",
        "What are you reading?",
        "Aww, best book?",
        "Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?",
        "Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. \u2026You don\u2019t want to help me with some of my sales, do you? \u2018Cause, I\u2019m kind of swamped.",
        "Really?",
        "Yesss. And you\u2019re Abby, right?",
        "I\u2019m Jim.  Annnnd\u2026 let\u2019s sell some paper.",
        "Let\u2019s start with\u2026 your mom.",
        "Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.",
        "Really? \u2018Cause she\u2019s pretty strong, Dwight.",
        "That\u2019s pretty funny.",
        "Can\u2019t believe his mom dressed him like that, that\u2019s the real tragedy.",
        "Ohh, man, I would love to! I can\u2019t tonight, but can I come over some other time?",
        "Thanks, Kev. Uhm\u2026 I\u2019m actually going on a date.",
        "Why does he own a guitar if he doesn\u2019t know how to play?",
        "Absolutely.",

        "Yup.",

        "Man, I\u2019m so sorry. When do you find out?",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Kelly, you know what\u2026",
        "Sometime today.",
        "Maybe, but\u2026 we\u2019re gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and\u2026",
        "So. We got Kev some stuff. Um\u2026 a party pack of M&amp;M\u2019s, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won\u2019t get that back.",
        "Which we realize sounds crass, but, it\u2026 is his favorite number.",

        "Yeah, you don\u2019t?",
        "\u2026Okay.",

        "Just\u2026 quit stalling.",
        "Such a dork.",
        "How old are you?",
        "Well that\u2019s an invasion of privacy, so, I\u2019m going to tell Michael.",
        "You\u2026 owe me.",

        "Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?",
        "Now how do you know how it works?",
        "No! You said that I\u2019d be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?",
        "Oh, um\u2026 Why do you keep CC\u2019ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?",

        "Yeah.",
        "",
        "Yeah, I mean it\u2019s inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I\u2019m fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.",
        "Dwight tried to kiss me.",
        "And I didn\u2019t tell anyone because I\u2019m not really sure how I feel about it.",
        "Well, I\u2019m not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.",

        "Oh.",
        "What did I write?",
        "Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.",
        "That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just\u2026 took \u2019em all out.",
        "Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don\u2019t sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.",

        "Okay, that is a \u201cno\u201d on the on the West Side Market.",
        "Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, there\u2019s no game.  We\u2019re just trying to get these chips for Karen.",
        "I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.",
        "And then we checked the fax machine.",
        "Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr\u2019s salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven\u2019t \u2026 . yeah.  You have \u2019em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number\u2026 six.  Wait, no.  I\u2019ll call you back.  Shut up .",
        "Nice!",
        "Sounded good.",
        "Where\u2019d I find what?",
        "I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.",
        "Umm\u2026 sure.",
        "He\u2019s so cute.",
        "That\u2019s okay.  Oh, no, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?",
        "Sounds good.",
        "What?",
        "Is it?",
        "No, I didn\u2019t. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn\u2019t take your chair.",
        "So I guess I can\u2019t get up.",
        "Sure.",
        "Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,",
        "Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me",
        "fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,",
        "Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.",
        "Ah, hey.",
        "Hi.",
        "Sorry, I forgot Kevin\u2019s extension. It\u2019s a fantasy football thing.",
        "And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be there. Why, why are you still there?",
        "Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?",
        "So\u2026",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Go ahead.",
        "Oh, good.",
        "What time is it here? Um, we\u2019re in the same time zone.",
        "How far away did you think we were?",
        "Yeah. I have a question for you.",
        "How many words per minute does the average person type?",
        "Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn\u2019t even type 90.",
        "Ok, I said average.",
        "Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.",
        "No.",
        "65. Ok, no need to laugh.",
        "Respectable?",
        "Right.",
        "Ok.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I know!",
        "No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?",
        "No, you\u2019re making this up!",
        "Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.",
        "And how many kitchens?",
        "Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.",
        "Most apartments these days have like three.",
        "Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?",
        "Pam?",
        "Pam?",
        "Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.",
        "Oh, no no.",
        "Yeah, uh, well.",
        "Ok.",
        "Yeah. Bye Pam.",
        "See, that\u2019s weird.",
        "I saw the movie. I just don\u2019t know every line from the film.",
        "Sorry.",
        "I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape\u2026 helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.",
        "Thank you.",
        "\u2018Scuse me?",
        "Wow.",
        "Yup.",
        "Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation\u2026 which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "Yep.",
        "Oh, Holy Mother of God.",
        "Good.",
        "Oh.",
        "Can I have a ride, man? I\u2026 uh\u2026 I have my bike.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh.",
        "I\u2019m a drunk driver.",
        "Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.",
        "No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that\u2019s all right.",
        "So good.",
        "Nope, I got eel.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, umm\u2026 kinda hard to explain.",
        "I don\u2019t have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight\u2019s stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future.  \u201cDwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.\u201d",
        "Really? Wow\u2026 that\u2019s bad.",
        "Well, I work here now.",
        "I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it\u2019s going to be weird that it\u2019s all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.",
        "Hey, do you have a second?",
        "I know it\u2019s not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who\u2019s coming over here from Scranton?",
        "Okay, so is it like sales or\u2026 accountants?",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.",
        "Wow.",
        "Thank you.",
        "No, it\u2019s just I\u2019m not sure if I um\u2026 well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um\u2026",
        "No. No, no. Just um\u2026 some personal stuff. And I\u2019m not really ready to revist that, I don\u2019t think.",
        "Okay.",
        "I really don\u2019t know.  How you doing with all this?",
        "You\u2019d actually move to Scranton?",
        "New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I\u2019d move to New York?",
        "Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton\u2026 it\u2019s not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.",
        "Okay.",
        "The Stamford branch is closing and everybody\u2019s just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know what? I think you just need to meet him.",
        "Sounds good Andy.",
        "Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I\u2019m out of here. See you later?",
        "Right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi, I\u2019m Jim. I\u2019m new here.",
        "Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we\u2019d never met\u2026",
        "Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.",
        "You, too.",
        "Where do I stand with Pam? Um\u2026 no idea. I mean, we\u2019re friends. Always have been friends. Um\u2026 .that is where we stand.",
        "Hey, Dwight.",
        "Okay. Sounds good.",
        "I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.",
        "No. Looks good.",
        "I\u2019m not.",
        "I am.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey! How are you man? Good to see\u2026 you.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Are you sitting here now?",
        "Oh.",
        "You know, man, it\u2019s really you\u2019re call.",
        "Let me get that for you.",
        "This one taken? No. Good.",
        "Hey, Toby!",
        "How are you, man?",
        "I just wanted to say hi.",
        "Oh. Is that like your new thing?",
        "No. It\u2019s cool.",
        "All right. Good to be back.",
        "All right.",
        "No problem.",
        "\u2026what?",
        "Kelly!",
        "Really?",
        "Great. What\u2019s new with you?",
        "Oh, this looks promising.",
        "It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. \u2018The Scranton Witch Project\u2019.",
        "Terrible. Totally unconvincing.",
        "Not bad, but you are Italian so\u2026 try it more Italian.",
        "You feel good?",
        "All right.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh yeah. I\u2019m trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.",
        "Well, I\u2019m evolving, Pam.",
        "Oh! Um\u2026 tonight, actually? No. I\u2019m uh just still getting settled.",
        "Okay.",
        "Nope. You\u2019re not interrupting anything. Nope. I\u2019m\u2026",
        "Don\u2019t\u2026",
        "All right.  I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.",
        "All right!",
        "Does he ever.",
        "Yeah, it does, actually.",
        "Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?",
        "What\u2019s wrong? You didn\u2019t have a good first day?",
        "Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I\u2026 .  Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?",
        "Ok, thanks.",
        "Hey.",
        "I thought you had already\u2026 left.",
        "Oh\u2026 Good.",
        "Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today\u2026 or something.",
        "I just think I should tell you that\u2026 I\u2019ve sort of started seeing someone. And uh\u2026",
        "O..ok. Um..good.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah. Good to be back.",
        "Hey, Kev. How you doing?",
        "Okay.",
        "Smart. Good.  Hey, Angela.",
        "Bye, Angela. All right, Kev.",
        "See you later.",
        "Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed.  Hey, who\u2019s that guy?",
        "Huh.",
        "Seems like a nice enough guy.",
        "What about, uh..",
        "Really?",
        "Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner?",
        "For the North.",
        "Obviously.",
        "Sorry. Man.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey.",
        "Just about\u2026 yup. Now.",
        "Yes. I have started to see Karen. It\u2019s very new, and\u2026 not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or\u2026 I dunno. Just, not yet.",
        "Jim Halpert.",
        "\u2026Okay I can\u2019t\u2026 help you\u2026 with that.",
        "She is dating Ryan, I think.",
        "She\u2019s\u2026 high-maintenance.",
        "Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.",
        "\u2026Absolutely you should.",
        "I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates\u2026",
        "Frisbee-based competitions\u2026",
        "She\u2026",
        "Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy.  Got it. Also\u2026 do you speak pig latin?",
        "Jonas Salk.",
        "Justin Timberlake?",
        "What is that, like\u2026 five pounds?",
        "Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.",
        "Quick question \u2013 do you play the guitar?",
        "Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that\u2019ll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?",
        "Yup. That\u2019s perfect.",
        "Hey.",
        "Perfect.",
        "\u2026I\u2019m messing with Andy. I\u2019m sending him to all the women in the office with\u2026 just\u2026 terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.",
        "\u2026Oh, you know what? \u2026 It was\u2026 gonna be Pam, but\u2026",
        "Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam\u2026 we\u2019ll give her a break. Let\u2019s think of someone else.",
        "Where\u2026 did you learn all of this?",
        "So, not prison.",
        "What\u2019d you do, Prison Mike?",
        "That is\u2026 quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.",
        "Well, you\u2019re\u2026 in\u2026 prison, but, mmhmm.",
        "Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.",
        "Merry Christmas Dwight.",
        "Wow. What have we got here?",
        "Dead goose.",
        "All right.",
        "Wow. Win-Win.",
        "Wow. What kind of bike is that?",
        "But the paint\u2019s chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?",
        "Oh, I think you\u2019re supposed to put a toy <i>in</i> the box, Creed.",
        "Carol.",
        "It\u2019s a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael\u2019s a bold guy.  Is bold the right word?",
        "What?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.",
        "You know what? Uh, I really don\u2019t think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?",
        "No, because of the promotion.",
        "It just feels a little bit, like\u2026",
        "I feel like there\u2019s a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then \u2026 what am I doing?",
        "Will they still air \u2018Rudolph?\u2019",
        "Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that\u2019s what you want, right?",
        "OK, I think I can help here.",
        "As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.",
        "Could you please keep it down?  I\u2019m in session. I\u2019ve determined that this committee is valid.",
        "Permission denied.",
        "OK.  Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.",
        "Yes.",
        "No, it\u2019s not.",
        "Oh,  she\u2019s asleep.",
        "Probably.",
        "And she\u2019s trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she\u2019s having trouble coming up with it.",
        "Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm\u2026 OK, it\u2019s pretty much the same thing.",
        "I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll want to meet her, too.",
        "All right",
        "What a horrible, horrible movie that was.",
        "Thank you.",
        "No. She wasn\u2019t.",
        "Well, for starters, I\u2019ve known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately  three hours ago.",
        "Sorry.",
        "You what?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You just had a rebound.",
        "Yeah. Which, don\u2019t get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it\u2019s over, you\u2019re left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.",
        "Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.",
        "Oh no, that would be great.",
        "Hmm\u2026 Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?",
        "So, really, you\u2019re just calling her?",
        "All right, let\u2019s get started. Umm\u2026 Oh, first off, we\u2019re supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So\u2026 let\u2019s push cardstock this week. Uh, also\u2026  what is this?",
        "For what?",
        "OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?",
        "Oh my God, Dwight, what\u2019re you doing?",
        "You\u2019re not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.",
        "Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that\u2019s making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He\u2019s got a knife!",
        "No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley\u2019s neck?!",
        "Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby\u2019s bonnet.",
        "Oh my God, Karen, you\u2019re right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.",
        "You want to talk about it?",
        "Yep, it\u2019s English, it\u2019s \u201cimpossible.\u201d",
        "Yikes.",
        "Fantastic.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. Yes. Um, I\u2019m just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.",
        "Really?",
        "So, I dunno, I just feel likes we\u2019ve been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.",
        "Hmm, what?",
        "Yeah, I guess.",
        "Hey, thanks a lot.",
        "Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?",
        "Urkel Grue.",
        "Uh, I think you dropped this",
        "Definitely.",
        "Are you stoned?",
        "In the picture, are you high?",
        "Is that not what happens when you\u2019re high?",
        "Oh, loves it.",
        "Green walls.",
        "Ooh\u2026 fancy.",
        "Nice.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hello.",
        "Yeah, you can.",
        "For this?",
        "Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael\u2019s new friend.",
        "Oh well, \u2018Yoy\u2019 should bring in \u2018Long Tim\u2019 in one day. Shouldn\u2019t he?",
        "Yeah. Right?",
        "Ok.",
        "Yup. I\u2019ll trade.",
        "Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.",
        "Seriously? You\u2019re going to sit in the back?",
        "You still do that thing?",
        "After you sir.",
        "Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.",
        "We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.",
        "Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.",
        "We have discount prices on ink cartridges\u2026",
        "And, also, any forms that you are going to need\u2026",
        "We can custom make them.",
        "Sure, that\u2019s true we can\u2019t compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?",
        "And this is Dunder-Mifflin.",
        "Hey, Kelly, it\u2019s Jim.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.",
        "We should go on a double date.",
        "Sure. Look at you!",
        "All right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No way! All right Pam. Congratulations.",
        "Which one was it?",
        "Cool.",
        "Oh",
        "Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?",
        "Congratulations.",
        "Big deal.",
        "Ok.",
        "Pam? Did I ever have a \u2018thing\u2019 for her? No, why? Did she say something?",
        "Yeah. Ok, here\u2019s the \u2026 I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn\u2019t feel the same way. So, it didn\u2019t amount to anything, and I left. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here. \u2018Kay?",
        "Hey man.",
        "Is that you singing?",
        "Nice job.",
        "You gonna answer it?",
        "Yikes.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.",
        "Hey.",
        "So Andy is in rare form today.",
        "Encourage him? I\u2019m the victim, okay? He\u2019s fishing for me. We\u2019ve got to do something.",
        "Fine. Party pooper.",
        "Hey, Ryan?",
        "You wanna pull a prank on Andy?",
        "I liked you better when you were the temp.",
        "Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?",
        "Okay, good. Stay right here.",
        "Are there any messages?",
        "So weird.",
        "No.",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "You know what?  Maybe it\u2019s in the ceiling.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh my God, that\u2019s half-inch drywall.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not freakin\u2019 funny!\u201d",
        "Hey.",
        "Yes.",
        "Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So\u2026",
        "Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.",
        "Hey.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Oh yeah.  Why?",
        "Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there\u2019s been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.",
        "Yeah, I know I should.",
        "No, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.",
        "Really?",
        "Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "Stop.  That\u2019s disgusting.",
        "Fine.",
        "Sally.",
        "Blonde.",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.",
        "Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.",
        "Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.",
        "Have you ever seen a stripper before?",
        "Yeah, me neither.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh God.",
        "Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.",
        "Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I\u2019m glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?",
        "Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again.  Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?",
        "In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I\u2019ve been conducting a similar experiment.",
        "Dwight, want an Altoid?",
        "Altoid?",
        "Mint Dwight?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "What?",
        "So what\u2019s in the box?",
        "Those flowers are nice.",
        "Phyllis and Robert.",
        "You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.",
        "Did you ever see that movie?",
        "You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.",
        "Hey.",
        "When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?",
        "Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.",
        "I know. It\u2019s very cute.",
        "Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then\u2026 No, it\u2019s totally hypothetical.",
        "Here\u2019s a \u2018not hypothetical\u2019. I\u2019m really happy I\u2019m with Karen.",
        "Pam\u2019s with Roy. I\u2019m with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin\u2019 on.",
        "Okay. Thanks.  Animal control will be here at six.",
        "I\u2019m sorry what did you say? So wierd\u2026",
        "The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There\u2019s no mark. I feel so\u2026 tingly\u2026 so strangely powerful\u2026  Oh well.",
        "Ow!",
        "That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It\u2019s white hot.",
        "What? \u2026 No. It burned me. I\u2026 bizarre.",
        "Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.",
        "The glare off Angela\u2019s crucifix? It\u2019s blinding.",
        "So\u2026 you\u2019re cool to just wait here for animal control?",
        "Cool. Okay. I\u2019m gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades\u2026 there\u2019s just so much sun in here\u2026 bye Dwight.",
        "OK, here we go\u2026 Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.",
        "Those are the books that sum up the other books.",
        "What are you reading?",
        "Oh, that could be interesting.",
        "I am ready.",
        "Five.",
        "Hmm\u2026 Five.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, I got it.",
        "Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can\u2019t get out, you don\u2019t want anyone to help you?",
        "Another worm? Like, are they friends?",
        "Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Oh. Um. I think we\u2019re good.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Why don\u2019t I wanna go? Didn\u2019t expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don\u2019t know any of these people. It\u2019s an obligation. I don\u2019t like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?",
        "Yep.",
        "Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.",
        "Gotcha. Alright.",
        "Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.",
        "Oh. Hadn\u2019t noticed.",
        "No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.",
        "Oh.",
        "You stay here and have fun, because I\u2019m going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.",
        "Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here?  Wow. Ok. You got me.",
        "So, none of them?",
        "Really?",
        "Ok.",
        "I don\u2019t know. Where to begin? My ball.",
        "Ok, so promise that you\u2019ll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.",
        "I don\u2019t know.  Feel like\u2026 Friday night crowds\u2026",
        "Agoraphobic?",
        "Really?",
        "Absolutely correct.",
        "Kev, have a good weekend.",
        "Here we go\u2026",
        "Ok\u2026",
        "Sounds good.",
        "Hey\u2026",
        "I guess\u2026 all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.",
        "Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you\u2026 for stopping Roy.  Thank you.",
        "Okay.  Um\u2026 Got you something.",
        "You don\u2019t know what it is.",
        "It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.",
        "Where\u2019d you get that?",
        "Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I\u2019ve been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.",
        "I can\u2019t hear you.",
        "Still nothin\u2019.",
        "No.",
        "Nice.",
        "Okay.",
        "And what happens in this one?",
        "Okay.",
        "Can I have a raise?",
        "Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.",
        "What?",
        "I didn\u2019t say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.",
        "So, none of that tipped you off?",
        "Yeah, that was nuts.",
        "No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.",
        "We\u2019ll see.  I\u2019m sure you guys will\u2026 find you way back to one another someday.",
        "Oh, yeah.  Don\u2019t worry about it.",
        "Ok, if you don\u2019t want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.",
        "Boy I\u2014",
        "It\u2019s like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he\u2019s like an eel.  I just can\u2019t grab onto him.  It\u2019s infuriating.",
        "Well\u2026 yes, that\u2019s probably what it is.  So what do I do?",
        "Thanks, Kev.  I\u2019m good though.",
        "What\u2019s what?",
        "Wow.  I guess word got around.  That\u2019s a nice\u2026 honor.",
        "Didn\u2019t think you\u2019d notice\u2026",
        "I\u2026 will never say a word.  And now, we are even.",
        "Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "No, I\u2019m not gonna call you that.",
        "Andy.",
        "Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.",
        "Dwight says that he actually doesn\u2019t know one single fact about bear attacks.",
        "Andy!  Nah, that\u2019s too far.",
        "You really wanna bet?",
        "Ok, you\u2019re on.",
        "No, don\u2019t worry about it.  We\u2019ll just got double or nothin\u2019.",
        "I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll figure somethin\u2019 out.",
        "There\u2019s like ten green ones.",
        "I\u2019m gonna say fifty.",
        "Oh, don\u2019t be that person.",
        "Kev\u2019s out.",
        "Okay, okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "I\u2019d say like\u2026 10,000 to 1?",
        "Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.",
        "Oh, excuse me.  It\u2019s my\u2026 favorite part.",
        "Oh my God, there <i>is</i> a castle.",
        "Oh.  He\u2019s going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.",
        "Hey uh, Michael.  Don\u2019t jump on the bouncy castle.  You can\u2019t do that, because you\u2019re going to get horribly, horribly injured.",
        "Dwight\u2026",
        "Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.",
        "OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.",
        "Come on.",
        "Come on. He\u2019ll listen to you.",
        "Oh!",
        "No no no!",
        "OK. careful, thanks.",
        "It\u2019s kind of blurry.  That\u2019s better.  Question.  What kind of bear is best?",
        "False.  Black bear.",
        "Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.",
        "Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that\u2019s a grand total of\u2026  eleven dollars.",
        "\u2026 MICHAEL!",
        "Absolutely.  I couldn\u2019t be more sorry about this.",
        "One more.  Why are you talking like that?",
        "Yeah, I gotta call out on that.",
        "All right.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m definitely gonna go alone.",
        "Oh, did the press ask for a story?",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "You know her name.",
        "It\u2019s fine.",
        "What about music?  Do you have any music?",
        "I was thinkin\u2019 about more like a CD, or\u2026 a CD.",
        "Lord, beer me strength.",
        "Did that <i>really</i> need to be said?",
        "Oh, is she that teacher in the white?",
        "Which one\u2026 is she?",
        "Wow.",
        "No, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Nope.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don\u2019t have a <i>lot</i> of time, so we should probably\u2026",
        "Andy\u2014 Ohh\u2026",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Well\u2026 that\u2019s not gonna hold up in court.",
        "All right.",
        "Not important.  Because you\u2019re not dating her.  Because it\u2019s a felony.",
        "<i>Probably</i> another high-school student.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And you should.",
        "Andy\u2026 is having a <i>real</i> rough day today.",
        "\u201cGood luck.\u201d",
        "You want music?",

        "OK.",
        "Look at that.",
        "Spot on.",
        "Oh, my God! Wow.",
        "Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.",
        "She looks older.",
        "No.",
        "Or a high school girl. Let\u2019s go .",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "Oh. You don\u2019t have to tell me this.",
        "You shouldn\u2019t be talking about that.",
        "Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.",
        "No, can\u2019t help you now.",
        "No. D-",
        "Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.",
        "Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.",
        "Don\u2019t do it.",
        "That\u2019s okay.",
        "What?",
        "No, that\u2019s your conscience. Listen to it.",
        "So, high school.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t smoke. Sorry.",
        "You should take up a musical instrument.",
        "Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He\u2019s a jerk, right?",
        "No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?",
        "How old do you think I am?",
        "",
        "Not that I know of.",
        "I drive a Saab station wagon.",
        "Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy?",
        "Yup.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, what\u2019s this?",
        "\u201cJim Halpert, tardiness.\u201d Ugh. I love it already.",
        "Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?",
        "Lay it on me.",
        "Now that sounds serious.",
        "Which would be me.",
        "OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.",
        "Oh, you don\u2019t want to know.",
        "OK, I\u2019ll call the <i>real</i> police.",
        "OK.",
        "Thank you.  The police are on it. They say they\u2019ve already had three calls.",
        "Mm\u2026 not really, no.",
        "Question. Won\u2019t that interfere with your other task forces?",
        "Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?",
        "Why don\u2019t you run the meeting? You play with dolls.",
        "No. Thank you, though.",
        "Not really. I\u2019ve seen a bathroom before.",
        "I think you mean a girl\u2019s <i>locker</i> room. And in the fantasy, there\u2019s usually girls in it.",
        "Go crazy.",
        "Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.",
        "Anna Maria\u2019s.",
        "Six-month anniversary. What?",
        "No, we\u2019ve been dating for six months.",
        "Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she\u2019s not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.",
        "That is pretty cool.",
        "Hey, Dwight. It\u2019s Jim.",
        "No, you\u2019re not. I\u2019m looking right at you.",
        "Don\u2019t.  I have information about the sex predator.",
        "I saw him two minutes ago.",
        "In the women\u2019s bathroom, above the sink.",
        "No. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but I don\u2019t think this is the place to do this.",
        "That\u2019s pretty cool.",
        "Really? Not Slytherin?",
        "I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.",
        "Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort \u2026 Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!",
        "Woah, stop, stop, stop. There\u2019s a hole. Step over the hole.",
        "Yup.  Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.",
        "Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step.  Yes!",
        "You can\u2019t say, or you can\u2019t pronounce it?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Yeah. No. Good.",
        "Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man\u2019s eyes\u2026 ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.",
        "Great. Yeah, I\u2019ll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.",
        "In well?",
        "How would that work in well?  I just want to know.",
        "Wait a minute.",
        "If this job is in a well, I don\u2019t want it.",
        "I don\u2019t!",
        "Nope.",
        "Oh, \u2019cause I don\u2019t want my feet to get burned.",
        "That\u2019s harsh.",
        "And that is not the same at all. If you\u2019re going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.",
        "Hey, I know what you\u2019re looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don\u2019t think I should be considered as your replacement.",
        "Michael, on Thursday I\u2019m going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.",
        "Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.",
        "Just one.",
        "The torches are lit.",
        "No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That\u2019s a hazard.",
        "Are you not gonna put out the torches?",
        "Okay.",
        "Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.",
        "He\u2019s gonna throw up.",
        "Hey, Kev.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Ohhh\u2026",
        "No.",
        "No way.",
        "Andy\u2026",
        "Nothing.",
        "Yup.",
        "Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.",
        "Thanks, Pam.",
        "Ahhh\u2026 just have so much paperwork to do.  Wow. Done. Okay, let\u2019s do it.",
        "So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early \u2019cause we want to spend the night in the city.",
        "Whoops.",
        "Hmmm.",
        "Ah, we\u2019re gonna go tonight, but we\u2019re gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?",
        "All right.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m not going to talk about this now.",
        "You sure?",
        "Wow.",
        "Uh, hmm.  Uh, hmm. What else?",
        "Hm. Really tough call.",
        "You know what? Why don\u2019t you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.",
        "All right.",
        "Oh hey, Dwight.",
        "Does my room have cable?",
        "Can I change rooms?",
        "Can I have a late checkout?",
        "You\u2019re not the manager even in your own fantasy?",
        "Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?",
        "Go.",
        "Yeah, bigger actually.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "Unbelievable.",
        "She could put the cup right there.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or\u2026",
        "Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?",
        "Oh\u2026",
        "Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?",
        "Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.",
        "Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It\u2019s in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That\u2019s when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.",
        "Oh do you mean when I get the job?",
        "You mean Kevin?",
        "Yeah, I do. C\u2019mon.",
        "Who\u2019s that?",
        "Beardy?",
        "I\u2019m gonna introduce myself.",
        "Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.",
        "Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don\u2019t have to stay, if you don\u2019t want.",
        "Okay.",
        "Sure.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I should leave.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, wait, so is the question \u201cHow\u2019d I get to be so awesome?\u201d  Because, I don\u2019t have an answer for you.",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "Oh, no, absolutely.",
        "There you go.",
        "What\u2019s that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there\u2019s just a  energy\u2026 New York has, uh\u2026  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.   So that\u2019s a\u2026 bonus.",
        "The friendships.",
        "How are your feet?",
        "The real reason that I went to Stamford\u2026 was because\u2026 I wanted to be\u2026 not here.",
        "And even though\u2026 I came back, I just, I feel like I\u2019ve never really\u2026 come back.",
        "Pam.   Sorry.  Um, are you free for dinner tonight?",
        "All right.  Then\u2026 it\u2019s a date.",
        "Really, what kind of celebrity?",
        "How much did you pay for it?",
        "You paid for it?",
        "I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh\u2026 it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn\u2019t mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh\u2026 I\u2019m single now and looking, so if you know anybody.",
        "Oh that sounds fun. I\u2019m mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "Who was driving?",
        "One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.",
        "Oh good, so we don\u2019t have to work.",
        "I can also take 3 people.",
        "I think she\u2019s awake.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Don\u2019t touch it.",
        "I will do some research.",
        "Six of one, really.",
        "So what\u2019s your strategy for this race?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "What?",
        "Why won\u2019t more people do that?",
        "What?",
        "Oh, ah\u2026 No that\u2019s not\u2026 I mean that wasn\u2019t, ah\u2026",
        "I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh\u2026 How it looks like um\u2026 I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um\u2026 anything.",
        "Right!",
        "Wow! There it is.",
        "It is going really great.",
        "Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Bat birth control",
        "Which we are.",
        "You know what though, I\u2019ve actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.",
        "Great, it\u2019s gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah\u2026 oh actually more with tips.",
        "Baquette.",
        "Eww.",
        "I can imagine.",
        "You couldn\u2019t have taken off all your clothes in the men\u2019s room?",
        "Gross.",
        "Alright.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?",
        "Oh, would you look at that.",
        "Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?",
        "OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that\u2019s already been cured.",
        "That\u2019s what I thought.",
        "Right. Let\u2019s do some good.",
        "Oh, and I get to carry it.",
        "\u2026talk about it.",
        "What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or\u2026",
        "Well, you\u2019re probably dehydrated.",
        "Glass of water would be a start.",
        "Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.",
        "You are?",
        "I\u2019m sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?",
        "Definitely not.",
        "Conference room?",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh wow, thank you.",
        "I\u2019m just gonna grab some chips, you want some?",
        "I guess.  How dare you.",
        "Ummm\u2026 yup. Yes, we are.",
        "Actually, we\u2019ve been dating for a couple months.",
        "Ohh..",
        "Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those \u2018we\u2019re dating\u2019 things for the company.",
        "Oh.",
        "Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or\u2026?",
        "What?",
        "Oh, OK.",
        "Great.",
        "Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s wrong with it.",
        "Swore I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.",
        "Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.",
        "Wait. What?  You knew? And you didn\u2019t say anything?",
        "Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.",
        "Oh no, we\u2019re just sitting here.",
        "OK.",
        "And\u2026 that is why we waited so long to tell people.",
        "Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.",
        "Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?",
        "Nice to meet you.",
        "There\u2019s this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it\u2019s heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.",
        "Wait for it.",
        "Hey Meredith, how you feelin\u2019?",
        "Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so\u2026",
        "Haha\u2026",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "MmmHmm\u2026",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Alright\u2026",
        "Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?",
        "Actually it sounds like you are.",
        "Or zipadeedoodaah.",
        "I was\u2026 mocking.",
        "Or a gong.",
        "Really?  Power gel?",
        "What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?",
        "What?",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m aware of that.  But he\u2019s also being super annoying.  And I\u2019m not a perfect person.",
        "Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.",
        "Sure we\u2019ll go.",
        "Oh I\u2019m sorry.  What?",
        "Nope.",
        "Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.",
        "How\u2019s it going?",
        "Yeah?",
        "You look a little worried.",
        "Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.",
        "Hey man.",
        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "Oh yeah?",
        "I\u2019m driving?",
        "Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.",
        "Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It\u2019s not.  It\u2019s different.  But it\u2019s a good book.",
        "What was that?",
        "Oh.  Two kisses.",
        "Gotcha.",
        "That would be fun.",
        "Uhhh.  Can\u2019t.",
        "Oh, no cause\u2026 you\u2019re gonna let me know when we\u2019re close, right?",
        "Mmmkay\u2026",
        "Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.",
        "Yep.",
        "Are there, uh, three w\u2019s at the beginning of the address?",
        "Yep.",
        "Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.",
        "You need to let him go.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, but not by kidnapping.",
        "As a hostage.",
        "I think you\u2019re under-thinking it.",
        "Ransom.",
        "What did he say?",
        "So, we should let him go.",
        "Okay.",
        "Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.",
        "Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?",
        "Okay.",
        "What have we got here?",
        "Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?",
        "Which one\u2019s this? Perfect.",
        "Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?",
        "And that\u2019s when I knew. You?",
        "That was the moment that you knew you liked me?",
        "Wow, can we make it a different moment?",
        "A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.",
        "Well it\u2019s just that you had no hair on Friday.",
        "How long have you been a man?",
        "That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.",
        "Sure, I can hold.",
        "Hey Dwight.",
        "Do you run the bed and breakfest?",
        "Does the Department of Health know about this?",
        "Uh, Michael.",
        "That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.",
        "Darn it!",
        "No, can\u2019t.",
        "Where are you going out tonight?",
        "I wouldn\u2019t understand or a secret?",
        "I can\u2019t believe this place is real. I mean, I\u2019ve heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.",
        "The Beets Motel? That is, wow.",
        "How are you doing this?",
        "Nice.",
        "Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.",
        "Not even Harry Potter?",
        "Hmmm, I\u2019d say 1 in 6.",
        "Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.",
        "You know, I\u2019ve just realized, this is Pam\u2019s and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine\u2026 uh but, wine that wasn\u2019t made out of beets. Didn\u2019t think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just\u2026 less.",
        "Wait, you\u2019re going up there?",
        "Hey Dwight.",
        "Does Mose have nightmares?",
        "Oh yes. Ever since the storm.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.",
        "Good night, Dwight.",
        "You okay?",
        "Are you a cocktail waitress?",
        "No, sometimes its right.",
        "Dwight, how\u2019s the hotel business?",
        "Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?",
        "Maybe you should.",
        "The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.",
        "You will never want to leave your room.",
        "Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?",
        "Yeah, I didn\u2019t think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.",
        "Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn\u2019t take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn\u2019t sleep, I couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.",
        "Ah, dinner.  Let\u2019s see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yep, I\u2019m very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I\u2019m in love with Italian food.",
        "Right back at ya.",
        "Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.",
        "Pam!  You don\u2019t think he\u2019ll mind if we take the shampoo, do you?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yes, they do.",
        "Where\u2019s Dwight?",
        "The office.",
        "Hmm.",
        "You\u2019re doin\u2019 great, buddy!",
        "I\u2019m sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?",
        "More spins.",
        "Nobody tell him!",
        "You got it, you\u2019re so close!",
        "Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don\u2019t think\u2026",
        "Nope.",
        "I think it\u2019s great that the company\u2019s making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or\u2026 And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.",
        "You playing that game again?",
        "Oh it has losers.",
        "Who are you talking to, specifically?",
        "Hey.",
        "Why don\u2019t we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what\u2019s going on here.  Okay, this is Dwight\u2019s Second Life. He\u2019s on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It\u2019s called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.",
        "Yeah.",
        "",
        "Oh, it\u2019s just my avatar guy. Whatever.",
        "Not much, it\u2019s just for tracking Dwight so\u2014",
        "Yep.",
        "I\u2026 why don\u2019t we go back to this animation.",
        "Ah, show me how this works.",
        "I hope you\u2019re not killing yourself on this, because I\u2019m sure it\u2019s good enough for Michael\u2019s ad that will probably be seen by no one.",
        "Okay. Do you want me to stay?",
        "Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I\u2019m pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.",
        "I, ah\u2026",
        "Good morning.  Yeah I\u2019m sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?",
        "Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director\u2019s cut. Hope you like it.",
        "Animation? All her by the way.",
        "I just thought you should\u2014",
        "Ahh.",
        "Okay.",
        "I don\u2019t want \u2013",
        "Mmm\u2026",
        "All right!   I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to be doing, but\u2026",
        "Yup.",
        "Right.",
        "Mmmhmm.  Why don\u2019t you start by telling me what you got.",
        "Love it.",
        "Mm, can\u2019t do that.",
        "Definitely can\u2019t do that.",
        "You know what?",
        "Okay, Scott, why don\u2019t you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.",
        "I\u2019m just doing my job, man.",
        "Good!  Fine!  I\u2019ve got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee\u2026",
        "What?  What?",
        "What?",
        "Okay, make a commercial.",
        "Closed.",
        "Michael is on a mission to prove that he\u2019s creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I\u2019ve ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t think that is what\u2019s happening.",
        "So tell me again why I can\u2019t be part of your club?",
        "Oscar?",
        "So what are you going to do?",
        "Did they?",
        "We just passed the exit for Corcroan.",
        "What are we doing?",
        "We\u2019re going to Utica?",
        "I\u2019m not going to Utica right now.",
        "No.",
        "I can\u2019t believe you guys.  I\u2019m not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.",
        "No, I\u2019m not calling Karen.",
        "What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!",
        "Are you kidding me?",
        "Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother\u2019s new baby on it, so\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "You know what?  I\u2019m just going to call a cab from here.",
        "Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?",
        "Oh, God.",
        "No.",
        "No, no absolutely we are not doing this.",
        "Are you kidding me?  We\u2019ve been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?",
        "So the deal was, Dwight doesn\u2019t blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.",
        "What?",
        "Okay, you know what?",
        "Why don\u2019t we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?",
        "It doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "Doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "That doesn\u2019t make sense, couldn\u2019t be.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Michael, watch the road!",
        "Michael! Michael, pull over!",
        "Pull over, pull over!",
        "I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re here, I can\u2019t believe this is happening.",
        "No, Michael.  I\u2019m not leaving the car.",
        "Guy\u2019s going by. Shh.",
        "No, no, you won\u2019t do that. Nope.",
        "Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?",
        "Oh my God, that\u2019s her! That\u2019s her, go, go, go.",
        "Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we\u2019ve ever done.",
        "Okay, you know what?  You don\u2019t need to be updating me as much as you\u2019re updating me.",
        "No, no, don\u2019t do anything to them.",
        "Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.",
        "Isn\u2019t that thing huge?",
        "No, that is a terrible idea, don\u2019t do this.",
        "Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-",
        "Damn it guys!",
        "Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!",
        "No, I\u2019m not doing that.",
        "No, I\u2019m not doing that!",
        "Hey Karen.",
        "First of all, hi.",
        "You good?  I\u2019m just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so\u2026",
        "Copy that.",
        "Yes?",
        "Yeah, trying to quit though.",
        "Oh no, I didn\u2019t want to see you.  Not that I\u2019m not happy seeing you, right now, I\u2019m just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I\u2019d say it was equal.  So, good to see you\u2026",
        "I mean, it\u2019s just that-  You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn\u2019t want to see\u2026 you\u2026",
        "Alright, you are welcome.  I\u2019m going to go because of, um, traffic.",
        "I\u2026 will\u2026",
        "Hey.",
        "Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?",
        "Angela\u2019s Ashes, top o\u2019 the morning to us.  Frankie\u2019s prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.",
        "Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, that wasn\u2019t fun.",
        "Of course I read it.",
        "Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.",
        "Well, you\u2019re driving, right?",
        "Mmm\u2026 I\u2019d prefer to sit in back.",
        "Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.",
        "I have to.  Pam, if I\u2019m not there, someone\u2019s going to go to jail.  Or die.",
        "Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.",
        "Well, yeah I don\u2019t want to see her get physically harmed, that\u2019s for sure.",
        "All right, I\u2019m gonna go now.",
        "Okay, I will.",
        "You embarrassed me.",
        "Got it.",
        "Absolutely, yes.",
        "When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.",
        "Yeah?",
        "And I am always busy.",
        "Oh, can\u2019t go today, \u2019cause I\u2019m donating blood.",
        "Is there a limit?",
        "Well, is that it? Or?",
        "How so?",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "Right.",
        "Not gonna change.",
        "I thought we had that looked at.",
        "Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?",
        "OK, great.",
        "Yup.",
        "That\u2019d be great.",
        "Oh, wasn\u2019t it just someone\u2019s birthday?",
        "I do remember, yeah.",
        "You know what, I have an idea. Why don\u2019t we just do one big shared party?",
        "There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.",
        "And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d And he\u2019s a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.",
        "So\u2026 I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.",
        "We can just have one big fun party. Everybody\u2019s happy, nobody wastes their time.",
        "It\u2019s a pretty good idea, don\u2019t you think?",
        "No\u2026 I think it\u2019s a great idea.",
        "You know, try sending them another invoice.",
        "Alright.  Oh, did you see my memo by the way?",
        "Right? I was just thinking\u2026",
        "Right! Exactly.  Knew I could count on you.",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "Oh, sure.",
        "OK.",
        "Yeah, people like me I guess.",
        "Well I think Meredith was just \u2014",
        "Everybody\u2019s birthday.",
        "What do you want?",
        "You want a birthday pie?",
        "Well, I\u2019m gonna to talk to Angela and we\u2019re gonna see what we can do about a pie.",
        "It will be Angela.",
        "Andy.",
        "Not your birthday.",
        "Alright, I\u2019ll look into it, but the answer\u2019s no.",
        "Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.",
        "Alright.",
        "OK, I\u2019m gonna go into this office here  to do some work. So I will be in here.",
        "Hey guys, what\u2019re we talking about?",
        "Toby.",
        "Oh, thanks man.",
        "Is there anything \u2014",
        "Oh, OK.",
        "What?",
        "I remember that.",
        "Seriously?",
        "Toby\u2019s great. He\u2019s great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much.  I don\u2019t see the harm in that. Well, it\u2019s a cake Toby, so, c\u2019mon.",
        "OK. Yeah, you know what, we\u2019re just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?",
        "That\u2019s a bummer. OK, then we need to\u2026 Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  \u2018Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.",
        "Yes, conference room in five minutes\u2026 No. No. We\u2019re gonna solve it right here. We\u2019re actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing?  One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn\u2019t do it.",
        "Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.",
        "Hey.",
        "Sure glad you\u2019re back.",
        "You have no idea.",
        "Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.",
        "So, terrible idea.",
        "You did do it?",
        "Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be here in ten years.",
        "That\u2019s what who said?",
        "That\u2019s what she said.",
        "How much time do I have?",
        "Nope I don\u2019t, remember when you told us not to make plans \u2019cause we\u2019re working.",
        "I think you did.",
        "Oh, I-",
        "Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we\u2019ve been able to get out of it. But I\u2019ve got to give him credit, he got me. Because I\u2019m starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.",
        "Hi.",
        "Let\u2019s see, since I saw you an hour ago?",
        "I have been getting ready and then driving over here.",
        "Really?",
        "Tour, let\u2019s do the tour first.",
        "Oh, you guys doing a little construction?",
        "It\u2019s fire.",
        "Just like that.",
        "Really? \u2019cause\u2026 seems pretty narrow\u2026 and short.",
        "Wow.",
        "What is that chestnut?",
        "Michael, I\u2019m just terrible at all this stuff, so that\u2019s really cool.",
        "Well, I saw \u2013 oh your Dundies. I\u2019m surprised they\u2019re not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.",
        "What was that?",
        "Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it\u2019s called \u2018Let\u2019s see how uncomfortable we can make our guests\u2019 and they\u2019re both winning. So I\u2019m going to make a run for it.",
        "You\u2019ll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.",
        "That\u2019s true. Um\u2026 dinner sounded delicious. Pam I\u2019ll see you at home, thank you so much.",
        "I don\u2019t know because I everything I own is there.",
        "Katie Holmes.",
        "Oh, Dawson\u2019s Creek.",
        "Not really a rhyme.",
        "Tom Cruise!",
        "Oh no she just put it in front of my face.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan\u2019s company?",
        "So\u2026 how do you guys know each other?",
        "Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions\u2026",
        "Nevermind.",
        "That\u2019s nice.",
        "It\u2019s getting late.",
        "Of course",
        "Oh\u2026 my apartment\u2019s on fire",
        "Flooded.",
        "You know, babe, I should have told you but\u2026 I did something bad.",
        "I stole this.  For you babe.",
        "We should probably get back.",
        "I didn\u2019t have anything, Jan.",
        "I\u2019m sorry.  She scares me.",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.",
        "Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.",
        "Oh, you don\u2019t know her.",
        "Your mom.",
        "Michael, you didn\u2019t even know her.",
        "Margaret?",
        "You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment.",
        "Oh really? Who\u2019s gonna take you in? You\u2019re messy. You\u2019re a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.",
        "OK, sure. Let\u2019s do it.",
        "Have I not proposed to you, yet?",
        "Oh, well, that\u2019s coming.",
        "No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.",
        "Pam, I\u2019m not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that\u2019s not how that works.",
        "Wait, I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s happening.",
        "And when it happens, it\u2019s going to kick your ass, Beesly. So\u2026 stay sharp.",
        "I am not kidding.  Got it a week after we started dating.",
        "Nice.",
        "Where do you want to go for dinner?",
        "Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?",
        "What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem?  Oh my God, you thought I wa\u2014 oh.",
        "No, no, no.",
        "I actually know a sex model.",
        "Yep.  Yeah.  She\u2019s blind, is that a problem?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "How\u2019d you get gum in your hair?",
        "But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.",
        "Nope. Not for you it\u2019s for your hair, and it is 9 am.",
        "Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?",
        "Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don\u2019t know that a website\u2019s going to be able to replace that.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Did I? I don\u2019t\u2026",
        "Hmm.",
        "Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.",
        "And then an older gentleman asked you \u201cBoxers or briefs?\u201d",
        "What?",
        "I\u2019m gonna go to my desk.",
        "I know.",
        "I can\u2019t.",
        "I\u2019m not single.",
        "Pam.",
        "You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn\u2019t have to come in at all tomorrow.",
        "So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas\u2026 the one time a year they hear one.",
        "Thanks a lot guys, Good job.",
        "Nice job everybody. Great work.",
        "Nope. I didn\u2019t, but let\u2019s go inside and I can call him right now.",
        "You really don\u2019t have his phone number?",
        "Great, It\u2019s under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or\u2026",
        "It\u2019s ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.",
        "It\u2019s not, it\u2019s not Eddie, it\u2019s ah, Evan or\u2026",
        "No guys his name\u2019s not Hank, it\u2019s ah, is it Edgar?",
        "Is it Elliot? Hey ch\u2026 chief, this is Jim Halpert from um\u2026 where you work. You\u2019re the guy who sits behind the desk\u2026 you\u2019re, you\u2019re the, the Afri\u2026 African-American guy, I mean you\u2019re. Ah\u2026 Who, Who\u2019ve I got here?",
        "Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it.  Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he\u2019s gonna let us all out.  He said it should just be under an hour, so\u2026  we did it.",
        "Yup\u2026",
        "Please don\u2019t pick up, please don\u2019t pick up, please don\u2019t pick up.",
        "Haaank. Is that you?",
        "Still haven\u2019t left the house yet, huh?",
        "Good. Please hurry.",
        "Will do.  I\u2019ll stop calling.",
        "Cleaning people. Oscar.  OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, \u2019cause I think they can help us.",
        "I\u2026 just\u2026 if they speak Spanish.",
        "Lucky us.",
        "Will do.   I\u2019ll stop calling.",
        "No, that was his wife, so he\u2019s on his way.",
        "Well, he\u2019ll be here really soon, Kev.",
        "Let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s not totally my fault.   Shared responsibility.",
        "Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn\u2019t lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it\u2019s warmer.",
        "Is that\u2026 I didn\u2019t know that was your\u2026 okay, so we\u2019re in agreement, this is not ideal\u2026 situation.",
        "Yeah that\u2019s true.",
        "If you were a real star you would put your face in it.",
        "We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea\u2026 Maybe the idea of a man.",
        "Greatness is only skin deep, some people say\u2026",
        "Well that\u2019s not true. Other people believe it\u2019s deeper inside\u2026",
        "And in this case\u2026",
        "That\u2019s also not true.",
        "You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly\u2026",
        "Would\u2026",
        "Well, it\u2019s too late, because I\u2019m proposing\u2026 that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.",
        "What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?",
        "An urban thing\u2026",
        "Oh boy\u2026",
        "On a wing and a prayer, mostly.",
        "A formal warning\u2026",
        "I\u2019m sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn\u2019t mean to go over your head.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s really\u2026",
        "Oh we were just\u2026 talking about, bureaucratic stuff\u2026",
        "Yeah\u2026",
        "That\u2019s not a good idea.",
        "Who?",
        "Let\u2019s go.",
        "Okay, you know what? Why don\u2019t you take my hand, and leave them, and let\u2019s get out of here.",
        "Who else is he mean to?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Hey.",
        "She\u2019s never worn these glasses before.",
        "Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.",
        "A formal warning, seriously?",
        "And no one cared.",
        "Productivity?  My numbers are good.",
        "Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I\u2019d like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I\u2019ve never done before. Try.",
        "Mr. Maguire, it\u2019s been a couple of years.",
        "Great!",
        "Hey, so how\u2019s the direct mail business going?",
        "Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-",
        "Absolutely, will do.",
        "So I guess I\u2019ll just\u2026 work on my short game.",
        "You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.",
        "Yep.",
        "Hey, can\u2019t really talk now, what\u2019s up?",
        "Uh, you know, we\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see.",
        "Oh, I like you.",
        "Yeah. All right. Bye.  All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?",
        "Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You know it\u2019s a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don\u2019t quit either, and I\u2019d call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after \u2026fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I\u2019m feeling pretty good.",
        "I closed it!",
        "Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.",
        "Thank you. You know what, screw this!",
        "If your client likes Italian food, you bring him to Cugino\u2019s.  And if your client likes a little action, you bring him a gambler.  And if your client hates Cornell, you bring him Andy.",

        "Hello, this is Dwight.",
        "Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second\u2026",
        "And how many would you like?",
        "Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.",
        "Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.",
        "Hello, this is Dwight.",
        "Yes it is.",
        "Oh, thank you. I\u2019ve been working out.",
        "Can\u2019t do that. Unsanitary.",
        "This is Dwight.",
        "Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.",
        "Oh, hello Mater. Good news: I\u2019ve married. Tell Fater.  Such a nice woman.",
        "Hey\u2026 What?",
        "No way! What did I say? I said that they\u2019d love those sketches. Congratulations!",
        "Yes! So when do you start?",
        "Wow. Busy morning.",
        "It\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019ll come visit you. And you\u2019ll visit me. It\u2019s only two hours away. It\u2019ll be fine. That part\u2019s gonna suck, but it\u2019ll be great.",
        "See how easy that is?",
        "So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it\u2019s big. It is really big.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I just-",
        "No, I didn\u2019t. I just logged it in right here, so\u2026",
        "All right, well it already went through, so\u2026",
        "Hello?",
        "That\u2019s not it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Close.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "What are the two levels?",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "Okay. Let\u2019s start with the \u201cI love you\u201d level.",
        "Yes. You don\u2019t love Holly.",
        "But you just met her.",
        "Oh, okay, it doesn\u2019t work like that.",
        "Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We\u2019ve been through this.",
        "Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.",
        "Well, we\u2019re really happy.",
        "And that\u2019s really sweet. And you can think that. But you don\u2019t say that out loud, and you definitely don\u2019t say it to her.",
        "I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and\u2026 Look, all I\u2019m saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.",
        "I was thinking\u2026 fireworks for the party. What do you think?",
        "Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.",
        "Because I\u2019m gonna miss Toby. Yep, he\u2019s a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn\u2019t matter. Here ya go.",
        "Well we all want a good party, right?",
        "I\u2019m going to propose tonight. Holy crap!",
        "Hey, Ryan, it\u2019s Jim. Look man, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don\u2019t care, because you\u2019re trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don\u2019t think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you\u2019re wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I\u2019m not going anywhere.",
        "What\u2019d you do?",
        "Wow. Okay, so how\u2019d that feel?",
        "Oh, I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t.",
        "There you go. There\u2019s plenty of base-laying left, right?\u2026 Hey. Hey!",
        "Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?",
        "Right to voicemail.  Hey, Ryan, it\u2019s Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck!",
        "Yeah, who\u2019d have thought?",
        "Classic.",
        "Not my favorite, but\u2026",
        "It\u2019s not my favorite\u2026",
        "Hey\u2026",
        "I know. That\u2019s awesome, man. That\u2019s great.",
        "Hi.",
        "He didn\u2019t mention me, did he?",
        "Thanks, Toby.",
        "I\u2019ve always gotten along well with Toby.  Uh, we\u2019re friends.  But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll stay in touch necessarily.  I think I\u2019ll probably get updates on him from Pam.",
        "Scared me.  How\u2019s the party planning going?",
        "So it\u2019s going great, sounds like.",
        "Hey.",
        "That\u2019s cool.",
        "Sure!",
        "Good one?  That\u2019s a cool camera.",
        "Okay, this is the second time in two days that the website isn\u2019t working.  Do you guys know anything about it?",
        "Do you honestly believe that?",
        "I\u2019m gonna get a second opinion.",
        "Okay, you could just say you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.",
        "Is Ryan gonna fire me?  I don\u2019t know.  I know that I\u2019ve done everything I can, and I just brought in a huge sale, and\u2026 am I insane, or was this kid a temp two years ago?  Because in the three years that he\u2019s been here, I think all he\u2019s ever done is start a fire and grow a beard.  And it\u2019s not even a good beard.",
        "Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That\u2019d be great.",
        "Why wouldn\u2019t you see him?  You work for him.",
        "Okay, what\u2019s going on?",
        "Really, nothing?",
        "Ah, they moved the shower.",
        "No, I didn\u2019t.  You know why?",
        "Because most of the time, friends don\u2019t talk about other friends\u2019 butts.",
        "But what have you learned about her?",
        "Nice.",
        "Well, I tried.",
        "I\u2019ll just go later.",
        "So you have the directions.",
        "You have a toothbrush.",
        "You have a cell phone charger.",
        "Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.",
        "What happened?",
        "Call me when you get in.",
        "Bye.",
        "Why haven\u2019t I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um \u2014 well, we didn\u2019t want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam\u2019s always said she doesn\u2019t want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I\u2019m not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here\u2026",
        "I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It\u2019s because Holly is kind of a major dork.",
        "I don\u2019t really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.",
        "When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.",
        "All right, I am connecting and \u2026 you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications\u2013",
        "All right!",
        "So what is going on, girl in the computer?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "That\u2019s not what that is.",
        "I would like to lose 65 pounds.",
        "Cryogenics. Beer me five.",
        "All right, I\u2019m taking off.",
        "Nope, just going to see Pam.",
        "Maybe put up some shelves.",
        "OK, thank you for \u2026 this.",
        "No.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, that\u2019s so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam\u2019s new art? It\u2019s right there. Check it out.",
        "Some girl came into Pam\u2019s room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I\u2019m in here waiting it out.",
        "Well that\u2019s great.   You\u2019re talking about your court ordered community service?",
        "But he did, right?",
        "All right.",
        "Nope.",
        "Mmm.",
        "How much weight have you lost, Dwight?",
        "No, you\u2019re definitely the problem.",
        "Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch\u2026 actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider\u2026 coworkers.",
        "Fair question.",
        "See, you\u2019re always saying there\u2019s something wrong with society, but\u2026 maybe there\u2019s something wrong with you.",
        "Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I\u2019m convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven\u2019t seen her in 10 days.  How\u2019s your summer?",
        "So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so\u2026",
        "I know.  I suck.",
        "Dwight says \u201cHi.\u201d",
        "Now he is saying \u201cHi\u201d louder.",
        "Umm\u2026",
        "Hey, can you go to IM?",
        "OK.",
        "I\u2019m gonna write you up for not working.",
        "",
        "Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.",
        "Perfect.",
        "",
        "I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t wait.",
        "Pam, will you marry me?",
        "So?",
        "Hey, sorry everybody.",
        "Hey Dwight.",
        "What\u2019s up, Meredith?",
        "No, you\u2019re not.",
        "Yeah, well, if you\u2019re only free till three on Sunday and I can\u2019t get there till one, then it\u2019s gonna be pretty tight.",
        "Hey, can you not?",
        "No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.",
        "When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us all to believe that he was the father\u2026 by telling us he was the father.  But then we got this e-mail from Jan.   \u201cHi, everyone!  Jan here, writing to share some wonderful news and to quash a rumor.  First, the great news \u2013 I am expecting.  The beautiful baby inside me will be ready to meet the world this fall just a few months before the launch of the new Serenity by Jan line .  Anyway, I also wanted to clarify that the father is not anyone that you or I have ever met.  Remember, no matter how excited someone is about my baby, it does not make them the father.  Best, Jan.  P.S. Hope to ship you something soon.\u201d",
        "Alright.  I\u2019ll tell everybody here that you say hi.",
        "Why, what happened?",
        "Ah.  That\u2026 they might be off the hook for because I\u2026 didn\u2019t tell them.",
        "I just didn\u2019t, you know, want a deal.",
        "OK.  You know what?  Here we go.  Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.",
        "Nope.",
        "Thank you Angela.",
        "Yes.",
        "To get married.",
        "Yep.",
        "Nice.",
        "Dwight, you\u2019ve really never stolen any company time?",
        "Jackpot.",
        "Yawn.  Four seconds.",
        "Oh you had said that you don\u2019t do anything personal during work time so\u2026 I\u2019m just making sure.",
        "Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.",
        "One second.",
        "Hey, Andy.",
        "By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?",
        "Actually not.  It was really so-so.",
        "I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but\u2026  Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?",
        "You know, it\u2019s weird.  It\u2019s practically a shot for shot remake.",
        "Story\u2019s kinda bland.  It\u2019s about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.",
        "He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven\u2019t even started work.  It\u2019s exhausting, being this vigilant.  I\u2019ll probably have to go home early today.",
        "19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?",
        "So I guess I can assume that was personal.",
        "So maybe you\u2019re not completely ethical after all.",
        "Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?",
        "Fraud.",
        "Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through  delusion.",
        "Right, the one from England.",
        "Oh. Right, that style.",
        "OK\u2026",
        "Wait, who\u2019s Sarah Kayacombsen?",
        "OK.",
        "No\u2026 way!",
        "Ha ha. That\u2019s hilarious?",
        "Who, Stacy?",
        "Uh\u2026",
        "OK, I\u2019ll ta\u2026I\u2019ll talk to you later.   That was a good story.",
        "Jan.",
        "What do we have here?",
        "Really\u2026",
        "Hey!  You busy?",
        "OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan\u2019s shower is going on right now, and she\u2019s singing \u201cSon of a Preacher Man\u201d and everyone\u2019s just staring at her.",
        "The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what \u2013 she\u2019s been singing for the last twenty minutes!",
        "Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.",
        "Hey, it\u2019s Jim.  Leave a message.",
        "Hey, it\u2019s me.  It is 5:03.",
        "You must be out or something.",
        "Is it me, or are we just a little off today?",
        "Hope you didn\u2019t have any major laundry issues.",
        "Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?",
        "Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I\u2019m just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.",
        "Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway\u2026",
        "I miss you.",
        "Oh yeah.  Wait \u2019til you get to know her better though.",
        "We were robbed last night.",
        "So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.",
        "I\u2019m on minute six of this message.",
        "The future mother of my children.",
        "Do you need us for any of this?",
        "5 dollars.",
        "I can see that.",
        "Another round, boys? Great.",
        "Hey man.",
        "Oh, I wouldn\u2019t-",
        "I\u2019m good. How you doing?",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Oh, she\u2019s good actually.",
        "She\u2019s, um, she\u2019s in New York. She\u2019s at an art school.",
        "Yeah, she\u2019s doing really well.",
        "She\u2019s engaged, um\u2026 to me.",
        "Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019d say she\u2019s happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.",
        "What?",
        "I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should.",
        "No. you know what? No. Because\u2026 I\u2019m not that guy. And  we are not that couple.",
        "Dave.",
        "You are?   A cat?",
        "Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.",
        "Hey New York, Happy Halloween!",
        "Oh, I\u2019ll walk you out.",
        "All right. We\u2019ll see.  No.",
        "I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.",
        "Hey, how are you?",
        "Good to see you.",
        "All right so now we can sit\u2026 and get comfortable.",
        "That\u2019s not really true. There\u2019s a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.",
        "Wow, that\u2019s- that\u2019s a little rude. What\u2019s your deal?",
        "Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She\u2019s a trumpeter. And, look at her.",
        "That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?",
        "Love that one.",
        "Here you go again! What is your deal today?",
        "One.",
        "Half.",
        "Also good.",
        "Pete couldn\u2019t make the Mets. She\u2019s at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?",
        "Pam, don\u2019t worry about it.",
        "Guys, what is going on?!",
        "Well, I\u2019ll be the judge of that. What do you got?",
        "That is good.",
        "Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank.  Oh, text message from my brother. \u201cPam cool. Welcome to the family.\u201d",
        "Yeah, we\u2019d never do that.",
        "You wouldn\u2019t tell your mom?",
        "Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn\u2019t know it from looking at her, but Pam\u2019s a gold-digger.",
        "Aww.",
        "Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.",
        "Nope.",
        "You must be really proud.",
        "Oh, sorry. It was just \u2014 it was right here.",
        "OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that\u2019s in here and you could use  uh, oh \u2014 Snoopy.",
        "How can you even be sure?",
        "Make the face.  Yeah, I don\u2019t see it.",
        "Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.",
        "It is\u2026 more of a spicy brown, actually.",
        "How was your meeting with Michael?",
        "Was it your scores?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Of course.",
        "Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.",
        "There\u2019s the charm.",
        "That is me. Wish me luck.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I love you, too.",
        "I\u2019m not talking to you.",
        "What?",
        "Did my scores drop a little?",
        "Are we even sure that\u2019s my file?",
        "Well, there\u2019s got to be an explanation.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think you mean smug",
        "Michael, I\u2019m just trying to \u2014",
        "I need a decent bonus, because I\u2019m actually in the process of buying my parents\u2019 house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t go wrong buying a house you can\u2019t afford. Pam doesn\u2019t know about the house, so it\u2019s\u2026 a fun surprise.  Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.",
        "A little bit. \u2026 Worth it.",
        "Microgement.",
        "Hello?",
        "Wow, that\u2019s great, because I need paper.",
        "Wow, this is my lucky day.",
        "I am Bill Buttlicker.",
        "How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.",
        "Would you hold on one second? That\u2019s my other line.",
        "Hello?  No, I\u2019m just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He\u2019s so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK.",
        "Sorry. That was a family emergency.",
        "You know what? That\u2019s private.",
        "Sorry, you\u2019re going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I\u2019m hard of hearing.",
        "You\u2019re gonna have to talk louder.",
        "Son, you have to talk louder.",
        "Louder, son!",
        "Now, you listen to me, sir.",

        "I\u2019m irate right now.",
        "Well, I should hope so.  Who is this?",
        "Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.",
        "Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I\u2019m going to do? I\u2019m going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.",
        "There is one condition, Michael.",
        "You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.",
        "Dwight. Dwight.",

        "What\u2019s that?",
        "Who\u2019s they?",

        "Good one.",
        "Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.",
        "Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but\u2026",
        "Hey, how are you and Darryl?",
        "Bye.",
        "What was?",
        "No, actually.",

        "I wasn\u2019t. But thank you.  Do you know anything about this party?",

        "Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.",
        "Is that it?",
        "OK, I\u2019m gonna assume that was it. Here\u2019s the thing: I think you\u2019re right. I think it was Kelly. I think she\u2019s mad at us for not coming to her party.",
        "Probably just Kelly.",
        "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.",

        "You knew it.",
        "You knew it the whole time, buddy.",
        "Wow.",
        "No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let\u2019s talk about this.",
        "We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.",
        "Who\u2019s that?",
        "Oh, that\u2019s gonna be great. Who\u2019s Chuck Close?",
        "That\u2019s it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.",

        "So, how you holdin\u2019 up?",
        "You know what you should do? Take a vacation.",
        "We should take a look at those surveys.",
        "Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I\u2019m just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It\u2019s just\u2026 different styles.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t have anything to say. I\u2019m just hiding from Dwight.",
        "So, as it turns out, Dwight is right. How bizarre.",
        "Why are you telling us this?",
        "Where are you going?",
        "Where is it?",
        "Okay.",
        "Six point five days.",
        "Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.",
        "Okay, okay, it\u2019s no big deal.  So you\u2019re not a computer geek.",
        "W\u2014Wow. Um. Well\u2026 okay.",
        "It\u2019s not\u2014 It\u2019s not about me.  I mean, this your dream.",
        "And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?",
        "You okay?",
        "Okay.",
        "Alright.",
        "Love you too.",
        "How does everyone know already?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "I\u2019m gonna grab a cup of coffee.",
        "Thanks man.",
        "I missed you.",
        "Welcome back.",
        "So why did you come in here?",
        "Why is that, why is that weird?",
        "She\u2019s probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.",
        "Toby works here again.",
        "Oh no.",
        "You don\u2019t know.",
        "You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he\u2019s, see if he\u2019s back.",
        "Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn\u2019t tell you that.",
        "That\u2019s really not cool.",
        "Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you\u2019re right.",
        "Today\u2019s a big day.  Today\u2019s the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it\u2019s my parent\u2019s house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It\u2019s got shag carpets.  I mean you can\u2019t blame my parents it was the 70\u2019s.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building.   She\u2019s gonna love it.  Right?",
        "Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?",
        "Oh thanks, Phyllis.",
        "Oh, it\u2019s on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?",
        "Definitely we should.",
        "Mmhmm, yeah.",
        "Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?",
        "No.",
        "I\u2019m always this close.",
        "Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so\u2026",
        "Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?",
        "Cool.",
        "I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now  open your eyes.  Tadah!",
        "I bought it.  It\u2019s ours.  Let\u2019s go inside, I\u2019ll show you inside.   So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation.   Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.   This is the master bedroom but, I\u2019m actually not allowed in here so\u2026",
        "So I\u2019m still in the process of converting the garage.  It\u2019s got great light in here and I\u2019m thinking, it could be perfect  for an art studio.   Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it\u2019s doesn\u2019t look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it\u2019s just\u2014",
        "You do?",
        "Really?",
        "Oh my God\u2026",
        "Yeah, I did.",
        "No, No, we\u2019ll just board that up.  It\u2019ll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.",
        "Yeah, I can\u2019t\u2026 really can\u2019t move him.",
        "Uh, actually, I\u2019m gonna go with copier.",
        "Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don\u2019t have to agree on everything.",
        "You have to make the decision.",
        "Hey.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "Oh, Pam, I really\u2026 hate that copier.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Beesly, are you threatening me?",
        "Okay.",
        "Whew.",
        "Woah, you guys going to lunch?",
        "Mind if I join?",
        "All right.",
        "Let\u2019s go.",
        "Let\u2019s do it.",

        "Ahh\u2026 I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You look really pretty.",
        "You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.",
        "Yeah?",
        "There they are.",

        "Okay.",

        "Wait, what?",
        "Truce?",
        "Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I\u2019m going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated.  Totally kidding.  I\u2019m gonna need four.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don\u2019t need a new system though.  Happy with ours.",
        "Jimbo!",
        "Ayyyy!",
        "Ayyyy!",
        "You\u2019re only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.",
        "Yeah.    She\u2019s fine.",
        "They\u2019re for her to look at, Michael.",
        "Yes, let\u2019s have a word.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "I understand that.",
        "Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.",
        "We do.",
        "That sounds fun.",
        "I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren\u2019t gonna sweep themselves.",
        "Oh yeah, I understood.",
        "No way, a 280?",
        "Yikes.",
        "No.  Bob, no. No!",
        "That is a lie, that is a lie.",
        "But! That girl must\u2019ve had monstrous hands because the holes fit.",
        "Nobody asked, Bob!",
        "I think if you ordered hot food you\u2019re allowed to eat.",
        "Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.",
        "We should help him out.",
        "Here they come.",
        "No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that\u2019s enough.",
        "Oh great, I have to cover?",
        "Well they didn\u2019t dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.",
        "We were.",
        "Empty.",
        "Oh boy.",
        "OK.",
        "So\u2026",
        "Oh initially I did.",
        "Ding Dong.",
        "KGB.",
        "Ding dong.",
        "Ding dong.",
        "The KGB will wait for no one!",
        "We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends \u2014",
        "\u2018Free paper.\u2019",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Why don\u2019t you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you\u2019ll know.",
        "What power?",
        "Well guys with girlfriends don\u2019t.",
        "Hey, Tom. What\u2019s that? Oh, you found a golden ticket.  One of my clients found a golden ticket.   Yup. No, congratulations.",
        "I\u2019ll take that down right now.",
        "I\u2019m on the phone.",
        "Hold on one second.",
        "It\u2019s actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.",
        "Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what\u2019s that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn\u2019t.",
        "How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?",
        "OK\u2026",
        "\u2026well I\u2019m going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn\u2019t lose half my sales.",
        "So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I\u2019m a little pissed too.",
        "Absolutely not, I\u2019m mad at you.",
        "Good one.",
        "All I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.",
        "No, that is what I mean.",
        "No, stop it.",
        "You cannot take the fall for him.",
        "He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?",
        "There it is.",
        "You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you\u2019ve been talking about that movie for years.",
        "And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.",
        "Yeah, let\u2019s face it. This meeting sounds like it\u2019s Wonka fans only. He\u2019s never seen the movie.",
        "Who is it?",
        "Alright. I just got out of the shower, I\u2019ll be one second.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it\u2019s a whole routine.",
        "If you want to come back then, that\u2019ll be fine.",
        "I get back from work around 6.",
        "You can try. That, that might work.",
        "Alright.",
        "About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.",
        "You called any headhunters?",
        "Right, cause that\u2019s what we are talking about.",
        "Its Monster dot com.  Singular.",
        "Yeah\u2026 .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.",
        "I would prefer not to.",
        "You\u2019re starting your own paper company?",
        "Why?",
        "Do you know the industry is in decline?",
        "Right.",
        "No, I did that before, it added nothing.",
        "Okay.",
        "I am not gonna do this.",
        "And you are not going to, either.",
        "Here\u2019s the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they\u2019re set up to do that kind of thing.",
        "Hey.",
        "Nothing, just talking.",
        "I didn\u2019t\u2026 no.",
        "I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.",
        "Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.",
        "What?",
        "What? Pam!",
        "Pam! You can\u2019t be serious.",
        "Still no.",
        "Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you\u2026",
        "I\u2019ll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.",
        "You gonna answer that, Kev?",
        "Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically?  I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.",
        "No.  Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.",
        "It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.",
        "Here we go.",
        "Kev, c\u2019mon.",
        "Would you please stop that?",
        "You\u2019re breathing very heavily.",
        "No it\u2019s not.",
        "Oh no. I was just \u2013",
        "\u2026 Yes.",
        "I\u2019ve never been a kiss up. I \u2013 it\u2019s just not how I operate. I mean, I\u2019ve always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.",
        "Uh, no. Nope. Not really.",
        "It\u2019s \u2019cause I\u2019m more of a player.",
        "You bet.",
        "Well I do.",
        "I play.",
        "Well, maybe you should get back to work.",
        "Maybe we will someday.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let\u2019s\u2026 eh\u2026 see ya.",
        "Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.",
        "Oh, there he goes.",
        "Yikes.",
        "Aw, man.",
        "Oh! Goal!",
        "Aw, it\u2019s gonna be the  worst.",
        "Left.",
        "Forward, definitely.",
        "Striker!",
        "Alright! Let\u2019s do it.",
        "Kickoff.  My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork.  Alright!",
        "What?",
        "Okay, I\u2019m just gonna go get some ice.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, Phyllis.",
        "LOVE the hair.",
        "You realize you\u2019re not actually talking to me, right?",
        "The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles\u2019 office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says \u201cYou wanted me\u201d enough, he will in fact want her. It\u2019s not the worse plan she\u2019s ever had.",
        "Hi!",
        "Sure!",
        "Okay.",
        "What the hell\u2019s a rundown?",
        "When did you need that rundown by?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I\u2019m gonna dive in. To the rundown. I\u2019ll be exhausted \u2019cause it\u2019s like a triathlon.  Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?",
        "Hey dude, you know what a \u201crundown\u201d is?",
        "\u201cUh, can you get this rundown for me?\u201d",
        "\u201cThis rundown better be really good\u201d?",
        "Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.",
        "No. I can\u2019t. It was like, hours ago.",
        "Oh, this is just something I\u2019m taking a break with.",
        "I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.",
        "Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you\u2019re looking for ?",
        "Keeping it simple -that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.",
        "No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.",
        "No, I\u2026.",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay.",
        "There\u2019s the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren\u2019t prepared for.",
        "Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?",
        "No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my\u2026?",
        "The one I have. I\u2019ll use the one I have.",
        "Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.",
        "Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for\u2026 several years. Wait, no, that can\u2019t be right.",
        "Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.",
        "I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?",
        "I think she just didn\u2019t want a crucifix cake.",
        "Am I going down a road?",
        "It\u2019s so scary how right the things you\u2019re saying are. And you\u2019re coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.",
        "I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.",
        "Hey, Andy. You know I\u2019ve been thinkin about what you said-",
        "-I just don\u2019t know if I can do it.",
        "It\u2019s just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I\u2019m pretty emotionally needy.",
        "You know that I was doin\u2019 this.",
        "Okay.",
        "I just totally blew a sales call.",
        "Yeah, well, with you it\u2019s different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!",
        "Why? When I look in the mirror, I don\u2019t like the face that looks back.",
        "Forget it.",
        "I said forget it.",
        "Oh, God.",
        "Hey.",
        "Okay.",
        "Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.",
        "And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.",
        "When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.",
        "Sorry. Her day.",
        "Are they looking at me?",
        "Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.",
        "Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!",
        "Oh, they\u2019re my client.",
        "Hey, David.",
        "",
        "Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?",
        "Really? Does he do good work or\u2013",
        "Hey. I saw you called.",
        "Oh, yeah, well don\u2019t worry about it.  We\u2019ll figure it out.  We\u2019ll be okay.",
        "Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.   Oh, that\u2019s my new \u201cDwight\u201d ring.",
        "Good, right?  Hello.",
        "Oh, okay.  Don\u2019t worry about it.",
        "Now, this is the projection over three months?",
        "Oh, but you didn\u2019t.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t know. You know, they\u2019ve taken a good deal of clients, so\u2013",
        "I mean I guess\u2013 I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.",
        "Okay, so I\u2019ll be back in, um\u2013 back in a bit.",
        "Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?",
        "Actually here for something else.",
        "You know I love a good guessing game, but why don\u2019t I just tell you what I\u2019m here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.",
        "David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh!  See I\u2019m here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.",
        "Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.",
        "Missed the last part.",
        "Got it.",
        "Great work Dwight.",
        "No, I mean, great detective work.  \u2018Cause this must be the first case you\u2019ve ever cracked, right?",
        "What are your top five cases?",
        "Because you\u2019ve solved zero cases.",
        "Got it.",
        "Can you give us a hint?",
        "Can I address that?",
        "Okay.",
        "Of course.  What is like a hostage?",
        "Strongly-painted picture.",
        "Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.",
        "Great.  See you upstairs.",
        "Hey, you have a second?",
        "Yeah, I think you\u2019re going to want to cool it with that \u2019cause it\u2019s starting to upset the other salesmen.",
        "This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be\u2013but definitely is\u2013a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.",
        "I know.  Yeah, it\u2019s\u2026kinda\u2013",
        "That\u2019s true.  That\u2019s right.  Yeah.",
        "Well, what if I just do this?",
        "I\u2019m just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He\u2019s winning.  I feel like I\u2019m describing a dream I had.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m engaged to Pam.",
        "Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?",
        "Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.",
        "I don\u2019t want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.",
        "Eh, she\u2019s nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.",
        "Well, that\u2019s\u2013",
        "Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.",
        "He definitely stole my iPod.",
        "You didn\u2019t hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious \u2019cause his mom drives him to work everyday.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That\u2019s not true.",
        "I think she\u2019d be a really good salesperson.",
        "And I won\u2019t.",
        "All right.  You\u2019re right, sometimes when she\u2019s tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that\u2019s not a weird voice.",
        "Take it easy.",
        "Not cool.",
        "There are other reasons to go to Ohio.",
        "So, it turns out it\u2019s the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.",
        "Ok. So, we\u2019re going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.",
        "Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that\u2019s great but then you have to invite \u2013",
        "No one.",
        "Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, \u201d You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.\u201d",
        "That makes sense.",
        "These are for you.",
        "You ready?",
        "We should probably stop by. It\u2019d mean a lot to him.",
        "We\u2019re gonna stay.",
        "Yeah. At least for one more dance.",
        "Yes.",

Which, actually, should be in about\u2026 ten minutes.",

        "Michael\u2026",
        "That Pam\u2019s pregnant.",
        "Okay. Thank you.",
        "Four months.",
        "Nope.",
        "Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.",
        "If everyone would like to see proof.",
        "Michael, we only told our parents last week.",
        "I did. It was inconclusive.",
        "Don\u2019t take it.",
        "You can\u2019t do this.",
        "That sounds terrible.",
        "",
        "",
        "Sure.",
        "Ah, this is just me and David, if that\u2019s okay.",
        "Who was that?",
        "No, I won\u2019t.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.",
        "I didn\u2019t tell Michael because I thought he\u2019d try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.",
        "Sure.",
        "When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?",
        "Why don\u2019t we head in your office to talk?",
        "Michael, look I\u2019ll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.",
        "Michael, did you say anything?",
        "Really?",
        "You will?  Wanna do it right now?",
        "I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.",
        "How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.",
        "So instead, you screwed me?",
        "No.",
        "Hi David.",
        "Wow, that sounds pretty cool.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Ah, ah, ah. Where\u2019s the \u201cplease\u201d? We\u2019re not animals.",
        "No, not without a \u201cplease.\u201d",
        "I\u2019m sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?",
        "Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So\u2026 When did this happen?",
        "Okay. And how do you feel?",
        "All right. Did he hit you?",
        "Did you cry?",
        "Did you feel like crying?",
        "I\u2019m just gonna write \u201cheld back tears.\u201d",
        "If you stop crying, I\u2019ll stop writing it.",
        "Michael\u2026",
        "Can I talk to you in my office for a second?",
        "I have noticed that we\u2013",
        "Thank you. I\u2019ve noticed we\u2019ve been having a lot of conference room meetings.",
        "And I\u2019m wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um\u2013",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.",
        "Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.",
        "I am.",
        "Right.",
        "Yes, I agree.",
        "I just think that maybe they\u2019re eating large amounts of the day.",
        "You mean on a weekend?",
        "How about this? I think our goal should be we don\u2019t have meetings unless they\u2019re absolutely essential.",
        "Really? You just agreed to that?",
        "Okay, I thought I saw people missing.",
        "Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?",
        "Stanley?",
        "Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people\u2019s time with meetings like these.",
        "Michael, this is a conference room meeting.",
        "That\u2019s not what I meant.",
        "I disagree.",
        "Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?",
        "That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.",
        "That\u2019s exactly what Wallace told us.",
        "I\u2019m not bossing you around. I\u2019m trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.",
        "Hey, David. You got Jim here.",
        "Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.",
        "David, I know that I\u2019m very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.",
        "Nope, not at all.",
        "Alright, thanks alot, David.",
        "You don\u2019t have to lie.",
        "Right.",
        "Alright. Let\u2019s get started.",
        "Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?",
        "Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.",
        "It\u2019s hard to tell so far.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?",
        "You just came up with that.",
        "Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro\u2013 everyone gets a little bit.",
        "Con\u2013 no one gets as much as they did last year.",
        "Pro\u2013 no favoritism.",
        "I\u2019ve been studying Michael for years, and I\u2019ve condensed what I\u2019ve learned into this chart\u2013  How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.",
        "You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.",
        "I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. \u2018Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us\u2026",
        "I\u2019m not gonna let you stop me from thinking.",
        "Michael.",
        "Look, you have a lot of strengths.",
        "I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.",
        "But there is a reason why I\u2019m here!",
        "No, it\u2019s because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!",
        "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re good at making tough decisions!",
        "At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it\u2019s an unpopular decision.",
        "But maybe I\u2019m here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I\u2019ve been sitting out there, and I\u2019ve been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.",
        "",
        "Could I have everyone\u2019s attention, please? I have some tough news, so I\u2019m just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won\u2019t. Now, what we\u2019ve decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.",
        "Look, you guys are smart, so I\u2019m just leveling with you. I\u2019m just trying to treat you like adults.",
        "Ooh, easy. That\u2019s not it at all.",
        "Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.",
        "Okay, Dwight, you know what? You\u2019d be getting the raise so\u2013",
        "Wow! I\u2019m just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so\u2026",
        "Thank you, Meredith.",
        "Rank each person individually?",
        "Well, obviously. Too bad he\u2019s a temp and doesn\u2019t count, so let\u2019s get started.",
        "Nope. I\u2019m numbering the paper.",
        "It\u2019s going really well, actually.",
        "Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture  of who you think deserv\u2013 who\u2019s that?",
        "He\u2019s not a part of this. You know that.",
        "Okay, your move.",
        "Here we go.",
        "Okay, you\u2019re gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.",
        "I was just trying to be unbiased.",
        "Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I\u2019d say I\u2019m about a four.",
        "Six. You?",
        "I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?",
        "We tried to find the fairest way to do it.",
        "I just\u2013 what?",
        "Michael\u2019s my only friend left in the office. Except Pam\u2026 I think. Is she still upset?",
        "Thank you.",
        "What\u2019s in here?",
        "Ooh!",
        "We would really appreciate it.",
        "It is really special.",
        "Well, congrats.",
        "Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don\u2019t column.",
        "No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.",
        "Absolutely. \u2018Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.",
        "That\u2019s nice.",
        "Good-bye.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, wow. That\u2019s cool.",
        "Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that\u2019s in my brain forever.",
        "Lousy Picture.",
        "Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It\u2019s really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.",
        "And Beesly. Tonight we\u2019re in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.",
        "I know. We\u2019re pretty excited, too.",
        "I don\u2019t like that.",
        "Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?",
        "Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.",
        "Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it\u2019s just going to be blood relatives, I think.",
        "Pretty sure everyone heard that.",
        "Mr. Beesly. How are ya?",
        "Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?",
        "No.",
        "Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.",
        "Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight\u2026 especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can\u2019t take a hint.  Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I\u2019ve ever had to do\u2026 which was just to wait. Uh, don\u2019t get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn\u2019t need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?",
        "I\u2019ve been driving stick since high school. So\u2026 yes. For a really long time that\u2019s all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that\u2026 I was waiting for my wife. So\u2026  I would like to propose a toast. So if you\u2019d all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses\u2013",
        "Pam can\u2019t drink? I didn\u2019t\u2013 I shouldn\u2019t have said that. I don\u2019t know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn\u2019t. She shouldn\u2019t because she\u2019s an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That\u2019s not true. I\u2013 no. What we want\u2013 the real reason is that, that Pam\u2019s pregnant.",
        "Michael.",
        "Oh, my God. Please.",
        "Alright.",
        "To waiting.",
        "I can\u2019t believe it was me.",
        "Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?",
        "I\u2019m so sorry.",
        "Oh, my God. Are you serious?",
        "What?",
        "What?",
        "What?",
        "Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I\u2019m pretty certain I\u2019m completely wasted.",
        "Uh\u2026",
        "And Dwight.",
        "Pam, it just happened.",
        "I love you.  Okay, I gotta\u2013I gotta go!",
        "No. Let\u2019s talk for a long time.",
        "That\u2019s not how that works.",
        "I may have told some people that.  I\u2019m nervous.  I\u2019m about to get married.",
        "Hey!",
        "Is this allowed?",
        "Wow.  You look\u2013",
        "So beautiful.  Hey\u2013",
        "Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you\u2019re so pretty.",
        "And who cares?  It\u2019s a stupid veil, right?",
        "There.  Now we\u2019re even.",
        "Well we are here now, so let\u2019s just\u2013",
        "You look great.",
        "I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we\u2019d need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.",
        "Hello?",
        "Oscar! Uh, what is going on?",
        "Look, We\u2019re in Puerto Rico, so-",
        "Hello?",
        "Michael?",
        "How did you get this number? Michael, we\u2019re on a catamaran.",
        "That sounds bad.",
        "I\u2019m gonna help you through it all right?",
        "All you\u2019re gonna need to  and-  it- and then go to\u2013",
        "And then you\u2019ll be saved.",
        "Just  and then you\u2019ll be saved.",
        "A- ah\u2013",
        "And you\u2019ll be saved.",
        "I  at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don\u2019t call again.",
        "It was.",
        "Really was.",
        "Puerto Rico was awesome.",
        "Frank and Beans.  Always makes her laugh.",
        "Nope.",
        "Do we have a conversation scheduled?",
        "Wow, that\u2019s\u2026 really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.",
        "It\u2019s a real handsome duck.",
        "Well, that\u2019s great. Congratulations. Who\u2019s the lucky lady?",
        "What?",
        "You\u2019re messing with me.",
        "You did not have sex with Pam\u2019s mom.",
        "What kind of car does she drive?",
        "",
        "Oh my God.  Oh my God.",
        "Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Not now, Toby, my God!",
        "Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.",
        "No, not more than anything.",
        "Don\u2019t call her \u201cthe mom.\u201d",
        "Then take a different way home, man!",
        "Okay, so we\u2019re good.",
        "Frank and beans!",
        "You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?",
        "You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael\u2019s slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.",
        "No, it-",
        "Uh, I think we should just drop it\u2026 \u2019cause obviously he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "Yes, you do.",
        "Just take the parrot.",
        "Okay, back to the old grind.",
        "Don\u2019t-",
        "Sounds complicated.",
        "Who wants a hot chocolate?",
        "Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.",
        "Andy, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "",
        "I am gonna need your advice  I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight\u2019s birthday, what do you think?",
        "Really?",
        "I was gonna go with this one.",
        "And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.",
        "Yes!  Angela!  Please\u2026",
        "Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder\u2026",
        "Yes.",
        "Nothing\u2026 nothing at all\u2026 it\u2019s all good!",
        "Barely, I\u2026 I don\u2019t have all the facts.  Frank and Bean\u2026",
        "Hey\u2026",
        "Yep\u2026",
        "Dwight, you brought the mallard back.",
        "Hi buddy.",
        "A wooden duck?",
        "Okay, just to be clear, you\u2019re terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage\u2026",
        "Silence.",
        "I won\u2019t.  But, you will wash and buff our car.",
        "Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.",
        "Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.",
        "Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?",
        "Well, we went on a Segway tour and we\u2019re awesome at it and Frank and Beans!",
        "Yeah\u2026 maybe.",
        "You\u2019re not, nope.  Nope.",
        "We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.",
        "Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.",
        "Wow.",
        "I bet we would.",
        "Cool.",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "Who doesn\u2019t?",
        "Oh. Actually, it\u2019s just gonna be me.",
        "That is a mistake.",
        "Alright. Let\u2019s clear this up.  Well, there\u2019s actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?",
        "Great. See ya\u2019 then.",
        "They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.",
        "I absolutely don\u2019t understand, either.",
        "Alright.",
        "Sure. Michael\u2019s a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That\u2019s what a teacher is, right?",
        "Dave.",
        "Dave.",
        "Yeah. I\u2019ve spoken to them on the phone.",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "No thanks.",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "\u2026and paper.",
        "Nope. No.",

        "I outran it.",
        "I\u2019ll just leave that suit in your office then.",
        "Mmm\u2026 it\u2019s like Michael said. It was some- something else.",
        "Truthfully, it wasn\u2019t the way he fell in. It was\u2026 how long it took him to get out.",
        "Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That\u2019s it.",
        "I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.",
        "No, they don\u2019t.",
        "Maybe if you make fun of yourself it\u2019ll all go away.",
        "Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.",
        "See?",
        "Mm\u2026 I\u2019m, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you\u2019re gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so\u2026",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We\u2019re not watchin\u2019 this.",
        "What happened to \u2018Do Not Mock\u2019?",
        "That will inevitably lead to mocking. So\u2026",
        "Guys. Michael can\u2019t handle this and as your boss I\u2019m saying we\u2019re not watching it.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "No.",
        "See what?",
        "Oscar, yes. You\u2019re right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.",
        "Oh\u2026 man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.",
        "It\u2019s a killer new dance move.  Do you wanna talk in your office?",
        "I didn\u2019t ask you.  Would you like to talk?",
        "I should\u2019ve grabbed you. I\u2019m sorry. Look, I thought I could\u2019ve done today\u2019s sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.",
        "He\u2019s alright.",
        "Thanks Michael.",
        "Oh man, that\u2019s crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.",
        "Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I\u2019ll talk to them.",
        "That\u2019s okay.",
        "It\u2019s my pleasure.  Hello?  Well that\u2019s great.   Turns out the paper was there all along.",
        "Pam\u2019s sales are fine actually.",
        "Wow.",
        "Oh, burn.  Burn on you\u2026 and a little bit on me, too.",
        "Definitely Grandma.",
        "Penny for your thoughts.",
        "Wow.",
        "Shel Silverstein.",
        "You set the bar so high.",
        "Okay, so\u2013",
        "Stop.",
        "Hey.",
        "Inappropriate.",
        "All the time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "She wants it bad Michael.",
        "I can.",
        "And I don\u2019t support her choice to hit you.",
        "But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.",
        "I just need some time.",
        "I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.",
        "No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.",
        "Feel better?",
        "Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate\u2026 because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.",
        "OK, so there\u2019s no defense for that, good to know.",
        "OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.",
        "So let\u2019s just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?",
        "And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.",
        "Oh my God, he\u2019s making you look like such a fool.",
        "You two are so evenly matched I don\u2019t know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.",
        "Are you serious?",
        "We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what\u2019s going to happen.",
        "Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they\u2019ll follow along.",
        "That\u2019s it.",
        "That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?",
        "Alright, let\u2019s conference room it up!   Here\u2019s the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.",
        "Sure I\u2019m a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.",
        "Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.",
        "OK, great.",
        "Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.",
        "I thought we agreed that we wouldn\u2019t do things like this.",
        "Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.",
        "And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?",
        "OK, I\u2019m going back to work.",
        "OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.",
        "Alright guys, it\u2019s a work day and you guys work here, so let\u2019s go do some work.",
        "Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-",
        "No, you\u2019re not reopening the case.  The case is closed.",
        "Or maybe he\u2019s just stuck in character.",
        "Both.  They\u2019re both worse.",
        "It\u2019s going to be alright. We\u2019re a good company, we\u2019ll figure this out.  We\u2019re not going under.",
        "Michael, not now.",
        "Michael, can I\u2026 OK, I\u2019m just going to skip right past the what and go with why.",
        "Michael, can I talk to you in your office?",
        "Caleb!",
        "Today of all days\u2026",
        "I\u2019ll take it.",
        "Hey David.",
        "Oh, OK.",
        "Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you\u2026 today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-",
        "OK.",
        "See ya.",
        "Nothing yet.",
        "Well there is some bad news.   There has been another murder.",
        "Conference room everyone.",
        "No.",
        "I think today was a good day to have two managers.  \u2018Cause if you\u2019re a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re crazy.  It\u2019s because they\u2019re doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.",
        "Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that \u2013 get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, I want to go home.",
        "Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.",
        "The next year he really stepped things up.",
        "A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.",
        "Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing\u2026 I can\u2019t remember.",
        "I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.",
        "Mmm.",
        "God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart.",
        "Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?",
        "But if the company doesn\u2019t go under then we\u2019ll finally have all our contacts in one program.",
        "Could go either way.",
        "Maybe we should just wait and find out.",
        "Ok.",
        "Nah. Might as well do it now.",
        "Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?",
        "Ok. You shouldn\u2019t be telling me that stuff and also shouldn\u2019t be taking two hour lunches without telling me.",
        "I care about them and I\u2019m just as much of a boss as Michael.  What\u2019s so funny? I\u2019m a co-manager.",
        "Well \u2013 who? How did you? Who, who told you this?",
        "Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael?",
        "Who here heard it from Ryan?",
        "Yes.",
        "I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?",
        "I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?",
        "To be honest, I don\u2019t know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.",
        "Oh, well I yell. You\u2019ve heard me yell.",
        "Well, that was apple-picking day and there\u2019s no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.",
        "Hey, Ryan. How\u2019s it going?",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "Simple data entry, though. So there\u2019s really only one way to do it.",
        "You know what?",
        "I think I know the problem.",
        "I think you seem distracted.",
        "But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it\u2019s really gonna help.",
        "I am, too. Let me show you.",
        "I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second.  Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone\u2019s attention.  I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.",
        "Let me show you what I mean.  Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.",
        "Right.",
        "You\u2019re a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you\u2019re in there. Enjoy it.",
        "Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?",
        "Wow, what do you put our chances at?",
        "Hmm, sounds risky.",
        "Wow, that\u2019s not such a bad idea.",
        "Anything else?",
        "Hey.  What\u2019s up?",
        "Did you murder someone?",
        "I think she\u2019s okay.",
        "Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?",
        "You\u2019re not in it at all, because you can\u2019t be employee of the month, you\u2019re a manager.",
        "It would look bad.  Sorry.",
        "Not much.",
        "Thanks Dwight.",
        "You\u2019re creeping me out.  I\u2019m gonna go.",
        "Let me guess, you think you should get it.",
        "Well, in an ideal world\u2026",
        "Okay, if it\u2019s all the same to you, I\u2019m just going to take away \u201cSurvival Skills\u201d and \u201cSelf-defense.\u201d",
        "That\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll do it.",
        "Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you\u2019re all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?",
        "Okay, wait, I was not\u2026 I did not-",
        "Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could\u2019ve given it to myself because I didn\u2019t even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.",
        "Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I\u2019m not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we\u2019ll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.",
        "Dwight?",
        "No, Dwight, I meant\u2026 Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-",
        "Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.",
        "Okay.",
        "Guys, this isn\u2019t some elaborate scam, okay?",
        "Okay.  That is me, but I didn\u2019t order the cake.",
        "This is Jim.",
        "Hey, uh David.",
        "So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It\u2019s been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.",
        "No.",
        "I really don\u2019t know how it happened, David.",
        "All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.",
        "Yeah.  Thank you.",
        "Yes.",
        "See you.",
        "See you tomorrow, Dwight.",
        "Too loud.",
        "Too, too loud. Too Loud.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This is all we have.",
        "No, it\u2019s not \u201cugh.\u201d It is\u2026 office camaraderie.",
        "Why would you start so high?",
        "Three, two, one!",
        "No.",
        "We didn\u2019t, because we think it\u2019d be better to do it together.",
        "Pam!",
        "Yes.",
        "Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.",
        "No, I\u2019m not gonna do that.",
        "I think she\u2019s doing a good job.",
        "I\u2019m not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can\u2019t be Santa.",
        "I\u2019m trying Phyllis. You\u2019re Santa.",
        "That\u2019s what I want.",
        "What would Bob do?",
        "Hey hey hey. Everything okay?",
        "Can I just talk to you for a second?",
        "You can\u2019t yell out \u201cI need this, I need this\u201d as you pin down an employee on your lap!",
        "Yup.",
        "Michael, it\u2019s Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.",
        "Great!",
        "Who wants Phyllis as Santa?",
        "And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand.   Can I get you some punch?",
        "No.",
        "Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.",
        "What?",
        "What?",
        "Wait wait wait, who said that?",
        "What?",
        "Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?",
        "Okay. We haven\u2019t gone under. We\u2019ve been sold and that can mean many different things.",
        "No, you won\u2019t, because he\u2019s not picking up his phone.",
        "Oh my God, David. That\u2019s horrible.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Co-manager, actually.",
        "Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So\u2026",
        "Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.",
        "Well, now we won\u2019t get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.",
        "Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That\u2019s weird.",
        "But if not, there\u2019s always the army. The infantry.",
        "So you\u2019ve been shown a nonsensical video. You\u2019re probably wondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Well, you\u2019re not alone.",
        "Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.",
        "Oh. Adorable, right?  I walked in on someone in the bathroom.",
        "I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Jerry.",
        "This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh \u2013",
        "No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn\u2019t like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn\u2019t focus on anything in particular.",
        "Do it.",
        "We should just go. He\u2019s really uncomfortable.",
        "What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?",
        "All right.",
        "There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.",
        "Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we\u2019re kind of planners. But we\u2019re also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.",
        "What?",
        "Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children\u2019s toilet? Why didn\u2019t you just lock the door, man?",
        "Anybody could have walked in.",
        "Whoa, whoa.",
        "I\u2019ll take over. Um, what we\u2019re doing here: Michael handles more of the \u201cbig-picture\u201d stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together\u2026",
        "Alright.",
        "No.",
        "I don\u2019t think so.",
        "I\u2026 Why would you just say something like that?",
        "Do you even know what that means?",
        "Um\u2026",
        "This is way more than I make now.",
        "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they\u2019re not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I\u2019m definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.",
        "Hey, you got a second?",
        "Actually, yeah.",
        "Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Really.",
        "No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.",
        "Why would you do that?",
        "Mm!",
        "You gotta do something, man. You can\u2019t just sit there.",
        "What is that?",
        "Oh. I\u2019m fine. Thank you, though.",
        "Why would I wanna do that?",
        "For now, I\u2019m just gonna go back to work here\u2026",
        "Yeah. Thank you.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, the grass is always greener.",
        "Well, it\u2019s what you wanted.",
        "For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I\u2019m not really sure what we do.",
        "Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could\u2019ve just gone and talked to her.",
        "That\u2019s it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.",
        "Michael\u2019s saying he\u2019s better at being manager, and I agree, cause he\u2019s a better people person, weirdly.",
        "Alright.",
        "Yep.",
        "Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I\u2019m excited.  Oh, definitely.",
        "Yeah, we\u2019re slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.",
        "Not to mention the extra night\u2019s sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it\u2019s crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it\u2019s a boy.",
        "Michael.",
        "Michael, you shouldn\u2019t have done that.",
        "Hmm, that logic\u2019s air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.",
        "Because the insurance company only covers two nights.",
        "That\u2019s seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.",
        "Are you serious?  Pam.",
        "I\u2026  Pam, please.",
        "Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.",
        "So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we\u2019re calling an audible, because that\u2019s her call.  Because she\u2019s the quarterback.  I\u2019m just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.",
        "Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.",
        "Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that\u2019s a big deal.  While we\u2019re on the subject, why don\u2019t I just run you down to the hospital and we\u2019ll just do a quick check?",
        "You know, it\u2019s getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day\u2019s not out yet.",
        "Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body\u2019s signals.",
        "Oh!  Oh, alright.  That\u2019s a good one.",
        "Okay, you know what?  I\u2019m going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He\u2019d probably know\u2026",
        "Alright.",
        "Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let\u2019s go to the hospital.  Pam, let\u2019s go to the hospital right now.",
        "Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.",
        "Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.",
        "No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Oh, and by the way, hate that you\u2019re helping her with this right now.  Totally.",
        "I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she\u2019s gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I\u2019m crazy.  But I\u2019m not crazy, she\u2019s crazy.  I\u2019m not crazy, she\u2019s crazy.    Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.",
        "Hey.",
        "Ah, you know me too well.",
        "Yeah?  \u2026  Oh.",
        "Did you say \u201cshe?\u201d",
        "Mad?  How could I be mad?  We\u2019re having a little girl.",
        "Wow, we\u2019re having a little girl.  Oh, man.",
        "Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Alright\u2026  Hey, did you change?",
        "Oh.  Oh\u2026",
        "Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.",
        "Let\u2019s give it a shot.",
        "Hey, come on.  Let\u2019s go to the hospital.",
        "Pam, Pam, it\u2019s time.  Let\u2019s go to the hospital.",
        "Come on, Michael says we should go now.",
        "Pam.",
        "You know what?  Let\u2019s go.  We got to go to the hospital.",
        "Hey, are you kidding me?",
        "If anyone can do this, you can do this.",
        "Pam, I\u2019m scared.  I\u2019m real scared.",
        "The best news is, we\u2019re going to have a baby today.",
        "A really awesome baby.",
        "So let\u2019s have it at the hospital.",
        "How are we doing on contractions?",
        "Two minutes\u2026",
        "Michael, I told you.",
        "No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.",
        "We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn\u2019t do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?",
        "Alright, we\u2019re driving ourselves, actually.",
        "Alright, I have my wallet.",
        "Go bag\u2019s in the car\u2026  Keys, my keys, where\u2019s my keys?",
        "Okay, I can\u2019t find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found \u2019em.  They\u2019re here.",
        "Okay, Michael!  Focus!",
        "Alright, here we go!  You\u2019re doing great!  She\u2019ll be here soon.",
        "Michael, come on!",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We\u2019ll be fine.",
        "Okay, so what do you want to do?",
        "Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We\u2019re going to the hospital now.",
        "Wait, you alright?",
        "Michael, just go park the car.",
        "Pam\u2019s doing great.  Uh, she\u2019s ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she\u2019s also fully faced.  Which I don\u2019t know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It\u2019s only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.",
        "Okay.",
        "Doing great, push again.",
        "No, don\u2019t push.  Pull.  Pull.",
        "Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she\u2019s so beautiful!  Oh, my God.",
        "No, let\u2019s let her rest.  I\u2019m sure there\u2019s still twelve on each.",
        "Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.",
        "She\u2019s seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.",
        "Hey, grandma\u2019s back.",
        "Great.",
        "Oh.  Let me get it.",
        "I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.",
        "Ready?",
        "It\u2019s so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.",
        "We were just kids.  What did we know?",
        "Great.",
        "I think we\u2019ll be okay.",
        "Ready?  One, two, three\u2026",
        "I can\u2019t.  She\u2019s too strong.  She\u2019s, careful, though.  You don\u2019t want to break it.",
        "I got it.  Alright.",
        "Nurse!",
        "How you doing?",
        "Really?",
        "Well, you\u2019re pushing the milk out, right?",
        "Wasn\u2019t it\u2026  It\u2019s kinda like a\u2026  Like that.",
        "I think you\u2019re good.  Doing a good job.",
        "Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.",
        "Alright.",
        "It\u2019s going to be alright.",
        "Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "Careful\u2026  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.",
        "You see that?  I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s\u2026  Hi.",
        "Yup.  Really great.  When\u2019s she available?",
        "Are you sure it doesn\u2019t hurt?",
        "Yup.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Perfect.",
        "I think she will.",
        "We\u2019ll figure it out.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Please do.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.",
        "No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.",
        "Okay, I\u2019ll just go get the other guy.",
        "Hmm?",
        "That\u2019s amazing.",
        "That\u2019s awesome.",
        "that\u2019s great.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Hey.",
        "What?",
        "Okay, okay.",
        "Perfect.",
        "Ha ha ha.",
        "We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?",
        "Half hour.",
        "Yes, car seat\u2019s right there.",
        "Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.",
        "Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be\u2026  Can we get a late checkout?  I don\u2019t\u2026  I don\u2019t think she heard me.",
        "Are you really sure we should be leaving?",
        "But you hear the baby crying, right?",
        "Uh, it\u2019s in the lot.",
        "Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.",
        "Five tickets on the windshield\u2026  Hey.",
        "You used my move, didn\u2019t you?",
        "Oh, thank you!",
        "Hey\u2026",
        "What do we got here?",
        "Of course.",
        "Hm hm.",
        "Okay.  Just gotta\u2026",
        "Morning!",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "No-no-no-no-no.",
        "Is this yours or mine?",
        "Good Lord!  I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m missing this.",
        "Okay. Love you. We\u2019ll talk soon.",
        "It is. Big time.",
        "Pretty amazing.",
        "Oh it\u2019s tough being here for a lot of reasons.",
        "Is that what happened to you?",
        "That\u2019s a common mistake.",
        "And I\u2019m actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.",
        "What?",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah that\u2019s great. Great.",
        "When\u2019s the last time you upgraded your printer?",
        "Please stop that!",
        "Can you grow up?",
        "Whether it\u2019s this time or next time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, we definitely can talk about it in the next\u2013",
        "You know, can I call you back?",
        "That would be great, thank you.",
        "No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.",
        "I am not surprised that Dwight\u2019s using my baby to steal my desk. I\u2019m a little surprised that it\u2019s working.",
        "Hey Jo, it\u2019s Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it\u2019s so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.",
        "You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks again by the way.",
        "Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem.  Thank you.",
        "Oh!",
        "No, it\u2019s not. They call it Quad-Desk.",
        "Oh my God. We\u2019re going to have to re-name it then aren\u2019t we?",
        "No.",
        "Is he you?",
        "Where did you take that?",
        "Oh my God, that\u2019s right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.",
        "Sure. That they should do one.",
        "Who\u2019s that?",
        "John Dillinger.",
        "Captain Crunch.",
        "At the Yankees game. Yeah.",
        "I had a little better reason to believe that\u2026 You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. Well, you\u2019re not right, because Johnny Depp\u2026",
        "\u2026in your condo complex.",
        "M. Night Shulman?",
        "Oh, sorry, wait one second.",
        "This is actually a big potential sale, so\u2026",
        "You writing your name over there?",
        "That\u2019s good. You know, with the kid.",
        "Alright, here we go.  Michael\u2026",
        "Michael \u2013  Great.",
        "What\u2019d you get?",
        "Alright!",
        "Hey.",
        "So I\u2019m going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one\u2019s going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?",
        "Alright. So why don\u2019t you just give me my share of the leads, and I\u2019ll start making some calls?",
        "Hey, alright.",
        "Ahh, these aren\u2019t leads. What are they?",
        "I don\u2019t think you understand \u2013",
        "This one\u2019s a map.",
        "I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?",
        "Oh my god, I couldn\u2019t envy you more.",
        "Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies  \u2013 that\u2019s just unfair.",
        "How about this one \u2013 \u2018When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.\u2019",
        "I love you.",
        "Michael\u2019s stupid scavenger hunt.",
        "Lincoln.",

        "Just all the \u2013 drama.",
        "Between the \u2013 us and you guys. It\u2019s unnecessary, right?",
        "Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.",
        "I have new baby pictures.",
        "She\u2019s wearing a onesie",
        "Didn\u2019t we kind of start it?",
        "Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?",
        "I don\u2019t think we need opposed.",
        "I\u2019ll text Pam. She\u2019s really good at this stuff.",
        "Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.",
        "Alright. Then we\u2019re back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I\u2019m for it.",
        "No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay  Hey everybody!",
        "No, no \u2013 this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.",
        "Yes! We do.  Eclairs.",
        "\u2013 two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.",

        "\u201cSorry, Gabe, but that show hasn\u2019t been on in many cookies.\u201d",
        "I think you need to go a little easy. You can\u2019t just suspend someone form work.",
        "And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.",
        "Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.",
        "Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?",
        "All right, so I\u2019ll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.",
        "Yeah, or maybe we don\u2019t even need that.",
        "That\u2019s a good point.",
        "Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.",
        "I don\u2019t even know who you are anymore.",
        "Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I\u2019m Jim.",
        "How are you?",
        "All right.",
        "So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate  So it\u2019s a tradeoff.",
        "Hold on one second.",
        "What?",
        "None of this is time sensitive.",
        "No.",
        "Well, maybe you shouldn\u2019t try to kiss people at work.",
        "Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.",
        "What?",
        "What was that?",
        "Pam, you know he\u2019s not gonna get anywhere, and he\u2019s gonna blow our sale.",
        "Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.",
        "Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don\u2019t have a lot of flexibility.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think so.",

        "Michael. Michael.",
        "Michael.",
        "No.",
        "What?",
        "Stop what?",
        "Yeah. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.",
        "Yup. That\u2019s exactly what we did.",
        "It\u2019s a pen.",
        "You do?",
        "But you didn\u2019t believe any of this was true five minutes ago.",
        "That\u2019s interesting. Wow, it\u2019s a little early for ice cream, don\u2019t you think?",
        "Oh, my God",
        "You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just\u2026 stop beating yourself up.",
        "Michael, no\u2026",
        "You should stop this,  and you should call Dwight right now.",
        "What?",
        "Wait, so are you\u2026 you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?",
        "Nice effort.",
        "That\u2019s\u2026 not okay.",
        "Stanley, please, this is serious!",
        "So we\u2019re gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?",
        "Exactly. It happened in Big.",
        "I\u2019m really too tired to do this.",
        "Then let\u2019s just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?",
        "We can order in from Hooters.",
        "Billy Joel Rock Band.",
        "Now you\u2019re just being hurtful.",
        "Pam.",
        "Yeah, well it\u2019s really warm in here. It\u2019s like a sleeping bag.",
        "Sorry about that.",
        "Well, you were surprisingly restrained.",
        "Excellent. Go for it.",
        "Right? So, uh, let\u2019s uh\u2026",
        "Now, were those for the team?",
        "Ah.",
        "What about an energy drink or something?",
        "Well, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t drink it.",
        "A place?",
        "Okay.",
        "So instead of working, you want\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "What was you? You were the leak?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Why\u2019d you do that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.",
        "This is a very good idea. This is good. Let\u2019s get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.",
        "Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don\u2019t definitely know it was Andy.",
        "Really?",
        "I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that\u2019s the point.",
        "Hey, listen man, you can\u2019t take it personally.",
        "No\u2026 sport.",
        "Hey, Dwight, I don\u2019t know if you heard, but we\u2019re supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.",
        "Wow, that\u2019s a lot of keys.",
        "That\u2019s right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.",
        "I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn\u2019t know for sure cause I don\u2019t have a trained ear. That\u2019s why I have to use one of these.",
        "Yep. Wait, and this.",
        "Go get \u2019em.",
        "What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.",
        "Oh, no. Don\u2019t worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but\u2026",
        "Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.",
        "Oh, man, so many points being made.",
        "But you\u2019re comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.",
        "You really think you can make it up to me with food?",
        "Yep. That\u2019s exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, \u201cI don\u2019t own an Ebay store,\u201d so\u2026",
        "You follow him on Twitter?",
        "Pam?",
        "I did not do this.",
        "This is impressive.",
        "Do they call you that?",
        "Come on, give me your hand. I\u2019ll help you down.",
        "Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?",
        "Great.",
        "Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.",
        "Is there really?",
        "Aaah!",
        "Wait. Is this your place Dwight?",
        "Oh\u2026 lets take the tour Pam.",
        "These are actually forks and knives from the break room.",
        "Don\u2019t beat yourself up.",
        "Who will be watching the children?",
        "Prove it.",
        "Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.",
        "But I\u2019ll tell you this, if this works out, I think we\u2019re looking real good.",
        "Did something happen Dwight?",
        "Pam?",
        "Everything is going to be ok.",
        "You\u2019re good\u2026 you\u2019re good at sales.",
        "Ok, Dwight. We can\u2019t do that. So why don\u2019t you just tell us what happened?",
        "Ok.",
        "Wait, wait, wait. That\u2019s actually a really good idea Kelly.",
        "Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.",
        "Alright.",
        "No, no. I want to hear you tell it.",
        "Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.",
        "No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?",
        "Agreed.",
        "We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.",
        "Wish us luck!",
        "Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.",
        "Wait a second. You know you can\u2019t buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I\u2019m saying right now, we can\u2019t do that.",
        "That\u2019s it.",
        "Stop, stop, stop.",
        "Did you just say you remember him?",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Lets just go.",
        "There it is. Alright.",
        "That\u2019s pretty good.",
        "Yes!",
        "It\u2019s my own fault-",
        "Really?",
        "For a lot of reasons.",
        "You should actually thank Erin, she\u2019s the one who agreed to babysit.",
        "Everything\u2019s fine.",
        "We can relax. Let\u2019s get our Sweeney on.",
        "Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.",
        "Oh, my God.",
        "Okay, this was pretty simple-",
        "Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.",
        "Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or\u2026",
        "No, we\u2019re good. Thank you, though.",
        "Alright, well, we\u2019re never leaving the house again.",
        "It\u2019s like The Hurt Locker!",
        "No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn\u2019t a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.",
        "We could put that in orange juice.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah!",
        "That was like, ten years ago.",
        "Nope, it\u2019s because it\u2019s genitalia.",
        "Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?",
        "Good!",
        "Are you sure you once knew how to do this?",
        "Just steer more now.",
        "No! No!",
        "Amazing. How do I look?",
        "Well, I do the best with what I\u2019ve got. Let\u2019s go.",
        "He\u2019s not the Steve Nash. He\u2019s big though. He\u2019s kind of like\u2026Scranton\u2019s Steve Nash.",
        "I\u2019m not doing that. I\u2019m just explaining.",
        "Phoenix Sun\u2019s point guard?",
        "No? Nothin\u2019?",
        "Well, I\u2019m neither of those things, so\u2026",
        "Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight\u2026",
        "Well, by worst, you mean the best.",
        "So, the situation is the worst.",
        "No, he didn\u2019t.",
        "Tell \u2019em.",
        "What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.",
        "Yeah, I thought you started it.",
        "Ahhh.",
        "Okay, great-",
        "-I\u2019m just gonna watch.",
        "How are ya?",
        "Dwight!",
        "Hey, it\u2019s Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?",
        "Listen, you gotta get over here, \u2019cause we\u2019re pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.",
        "Yes.",
        "The big gun thing.  Stop!",
        "No, that\u2019s him.",
        "Nope, not doing that.",
        "Showtime!",
        "No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "Is that your office?",
        "A what?",
        "I think you mean The Sting.",
        "Nope. Different movie.",
        "Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and\u2026that\u2019s it. That\u2019s really all we were looking for.",
        "Meredith Van Helsing?",
        "Okay. But what is he more famous for?",
        "You know this isn\u2019t real TV, right?",
        "Okay, he\u2019s not that good-looking. I don\u2019t understand why everybody\u2019s obsessed with this-",
        "We gotta get someone else in there right now.",
        "You\u2019re an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here\u2019s the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?",
        "So you\u2019re taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.",
        "Yes.",
        "Exactly. You can do this.",
        "Stop it! It\u2019s gonna be great.",
        "And listen if anything else happens, just\u2026roll with it.",
        "Who else we got?",
        "Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.",
        "No, no, no, no\u2026",
        "No, no, no, no.",
        "Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.",
        "You hired him?",
        "Did ya?",
        "I\u2019m just kidding. She told me about it.",
        "Oh.",
        "Dwight, please.",
        "Hey, crazy, um\u2026so\u2026that\u2019s it? You\u2019re just-you\u2019re fine?",
        "I don\u2019t know.  Oh! That\u2019s\u2026 not\u2026 yours.",
        "Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn\u2019t seem to realize that it wasn\u2019t his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won\u2019t notice?",
        "Stop.",
        "Sounds like someone\u2019s really trying to convince us that he\u2019s not the Scranton Strangler.",
        "I am Popeye!",
        "I\u2019ve never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number  \u2026no.",
        "So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.",
        "That\u2019s right.",
        "Yikes.",
        "Oh, no.",
        "No. No, I\u2019m not gonna-no.",
        "I don\u2019t care.",
        "Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.",
        "That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.",
        "It\u2019s not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don\u2019t know about?",
        "Oooh! You can\u2019t handle the truth!",
        "We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?",
        "Hey.",
        "When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don\u2019t work hard. Oh, here\u2019s something. Uh, why didn\u2019t you ever call Pam back?",
        "Yeah. I mean, I\u2019m not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I\u2019m just saying\u2026 but you know, to not even call her back is\u2026",
        "Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.",
        "Nope.",
        "Just tell her the real reason.",
        "Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.",
        "Hey, man.",
        "To be honest, I still can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t call her back. Who doesn\u2019t call a dork like that back?",
        "Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach.",
        "Stop.",
        "Elaborate.",
        "So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "Big day.",
        "Nope.",
        "It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.",
        "Ok, your turn.",
        "Right now?",
        "Okay. All right, come on.  Where are we going? Where are we going? We\u2019re gonna take a little field trip.",
        "Okay. Okay. There\u2019s my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What\u2019s that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!",
        "What?",
        "Yes.",
        "This is happening.",
        "No. There\u2019s no extra outfit in the bag.",

        "Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.",
        "Okay, \u201cA,\u201d Halbert. And, \u201cB,\u201d I think a more appropriate statement would be, \u201cThe \u2018Halberts\u2019 are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.\u201d",
        "Hey.",

        "Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.",
        "Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson\u2019s funeral. Things that if you didn\u2019t see them live, you wouldn\u2019t really care that you didn\u2019t see them at all.",

What\u2019s going to happen is he\u2019s going to try and bring up what ever you\u2019re talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he\u2019ll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven\u2019t you noticed that I don\u2019t bring up the Tour de France around him?",

        "Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You\u2019re not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?",
        "Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.",
        "No no no it\u2019s ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She\u2019s laughing and she\u2019s happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.",
        "Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here\u2019s the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.",
        "And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.",
        "Nope.",
        "Ok. Bye.",
        "There you go. Thanks.",
        "Big tip.",
        "What?",
        "We decided to have a Valentine\u2019s day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine\u2019s day dinner thing. It\u2019s a whole thing.",
        "Shh.",
        "Um, bottomless champagne.",
        "No.",
        "All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you.",
        "Wait.",
        "Aww, nuts.",
        "OOH! Boom! Face!",
        "Did it!",
        "Love it. Keep it goin.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Ew.",
        "Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he\u2019s not here.",
        "Definitely not. That\u2019s disgusting.",
        "Hey, you don\u2019t have to\u2026",
        "That was really rough.",
        "No, because the office isn\u2019t what I\u2019d consider a romantic place.",
        "And a shower.",
        "What?",
        "No. We took a walk.",
        "Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.",
        "Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!",
        "I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.",
        "Sorry.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.",
        "That\u2019s fine, it\u2019s great!",
        "Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.",
        "Three months.",
        "Four months.",
        "Eight months?",
        "Eleven months.",
        "Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.",
        "Four hundred and ninety-four months?",
        "Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That\u2019s just\u2026",
        "Why is Packer back?",
        "What!?",
        "You did approve it?",
        "Can I do something for ya?",
        "Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so\u2026",
        "Do I have any say in this?!",
        "Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?",
        "Why are you nodding?",
        "Well, I mean he humped Michael.",
        "Yeah.",
        "",
        "That\u2019s a lot of reasons!",
        "Can I talk to you a second?",
        "So, this hot chocolate thing.",
        "Well, you know you can\u2019t actually poison him.",
        "I really think we should join forces on this one.",
        "What do we think, what would drive him crazy.",
        "Here we go.",
        "You\u2019ve gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can\u2019t get to them.",
        "Okay! Well this isn\u2019t my best, but call Froggy101, say that we\u2019re the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we\u2019re giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it\u2019s his own number.",
        "He\u2026 It\u2019s a crime fighting beaver.",
        "Absolutely, I\u2019ll e-mail you a hundred.",
        "Yeah I couldn\u2019t cut it down.",
        "One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?",
        "Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo\u2019s a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you\u2019re gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool.",
        "It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo\u2019s kept her eye on you!",
        "Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!",
        "All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now!",
        "He\u2019s a jerk.",
        "Wait! Why don\u2019t we come up with a plan we\u2019re all happy about?",
        "Oh, yikes.",
        "How did those get out? I\u2019m sorry.",
        "I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he\u2019s selling these. Dwight he\u2019s telling me things about myself that there\u2019s no way he could have known.",
        "Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.",
        "Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield\u2019s Miracle Legumes.",
        "I\u2019m really sorry. Pam must have put those out.",
        "They\u2019re legumes Dwight, and you\u2019re just gonna make fun of me, so why would I\u2026 You know what, this ends now.",
        "She\u2019s amazing. This is very exciting.",
        "That\u2019s a guarantee.",
        "Don\u2019t think you need the corpse then.",
        "At a gas station.",
        "Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.",
        "Totally reasonable.",
        "Cause it\u2019s a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.",
        "Yeah\u2026 it.s scary.",
        "Not bad right.",
        "Nice.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "It is right. I mean, it\u2019s impossible.",
        "They\u2019re probably worthless.",
        "Leave the telescope.",
        "Holly, will you marry me?",
        "Congratulations!",
        "Wait, what?",
        "We made that.",
        "Yeah, they don\u2019t ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.",
        "Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them \u2018da-das\u2019.",
        "And what happens here is-",
        "We were\u2026 I think she was just trying to-",
        "Wait, so, you don\u2019t go into shock or die or anything?",
        "Listen, you\u2019re the one who decided to leave. Come on, he\u2019s the new boss, you know we have to do this.",
        "Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "We\u2019re back in! Right?",
        "Yep, okay\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "No she doesn\u2019t wa- She\u2019s not here.",
        "Stay in bed!",
        "Having a great time.",
        "Thanks, yeah.",
        "Why don\u2019t you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.",
        "I just don\u2019t understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.",
        "Who\u2019s gonna see us?",
        "Get in the car?",
        "I think I\u2019m gonna go.",
        "I think you got this. Kay?  Alright. Feel better!",
        "I\u2019m sorry, that just wasn\u2019t interesting to me.",
        "",
        "Nope, go back to the script.",
        "Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you\u2019re watching this at home it\u2019s way past your bedtime, by the way how\u2019d this get televised?",
        "I don\u2019t know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. Thank you!",
        "Didn\u2019t I?",
        "I gotta go do this.",
        "I don\u2019t know that we need to dissect it all now, but-",
        "That did. Pretty huge laugh.",
        "And impressions!",
        "You gotta play along man.",
        "So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?",
        "Hey! It\u2019s almost your last day, come sit with us.",
        "You sure?",
        "Did you break the shredder Kevin?",
        "Ahh, what happened to you?",
        "Uhh, she\u2019s still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.",
        "Hey, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "So I\u2019ve been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.",
        "What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?",
        "You\u2019re not leaving tomorrow. You\u2019re leaving today right?",
        "Wow, so that\u2019s it huh? Just, four o\u2019clock and you are gone for good.",
        "Absolutely not. It\u2019s just that sometimes\u2026 goodbyes are a bitch.",
        "You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.",
        "And then tomorrow, I can tell you\u2026 what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had.",
        "Alright.",
        "Listen Michael, I really\u2026 I did text Pam, but\u2026",
        "I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.",
        "You got it.",
        "Hey!",
        "No he doesn\u2019t.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.",
        "Every time there\u2019s a silence, your brain\u2019s like \u201cHeh-heh-huh-huh\u201d .",
        "Careful.  There is no inner circle.",
        "There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.",
        "That\u2019s Toys R Us, I think.",
        "Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled \u201cadministrative\u201d and \u201cassistant.\u201d",
        "Seriously?",
        "What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?",
        "He\u2019s good at his job.  And I like working for him.",
        "And say what?  \u201cHey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?\u201d",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "Hey, you got a second?",
        "Umm, really, it\u2019s nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was \u2014",
        "If it\u2019s alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over \u2014",
        "I know.   Just the guys.  Well, maybe that\u2019s, uh, part of the problem.  I think\u2026so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.",
        "Maybe there\u2019s a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are\u2026a little sexist, or \u2014",
        "Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.",
        "Oh.  Like nobody.",
        "It was \u2014",
        "That\u2019s awesome.",
        "Hey, who\u2019d you end up hiring?",
        "Oh yeah, did he text us?",
        "He didn\u2019t text me.",
        "Don\u2019t worry, the first day\u2019s always the hardest.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Nope.  Just\u2026  Okay.",
        "Well, there is no inner\u2026circle.",
        "So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery .  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.",
        "You know what?  Instead of a game, why don\u2019t we do an exhibition?  I\u2019d love to see that dunk of yours.",
        "Today.  Now, maybe.  \u2018Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don\u2019t have to mime it.",
        "Why not?",
        "Alright, there you go.",
        "15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?",
        "Okay.",
        "Fantastic.",
        "Yup.",
        "Now what?",
        "Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?",
        "Erin.",
        "All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons?",
        "Nope. Baskets have it.",
        "So as it turns out, unless you\u2019re a young child or a prison inmate, you don\u2019t need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that \u2013 people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised.  And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.",
        "Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I\u2019m just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you.  That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her\u2026 I don\u2019t want to mess this up, right? There\u2019s a consensus, people are happy.",
        "Wait\u2026",
        "I\u2019m coming.",
        "You\u2019d slow me down.",
        "Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let\u2019s see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger.  We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine\u2019s at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.",
        "Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?",
        "You define foment.",
        "Oh, it\u2019s just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It\u2019s just a club. Guys talking, you know.",
        "Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion.",
        "And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.",
        "Wow, you\u2019ve really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.",
        "And the desk.",
        "Okay.",
        "I promise\u2026d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so\u2026",
        "You can\u2019t fire me. You\u2019re acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.",
        "You wouldn\u2019t dare.",
        "If you get promoted, and if you haven\u2019t fallen in love with me by then.",
        "If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, \u201cWell that\u2019s pretty premature to think,\u201d but I always say, it\u2019s better to be pre-pre-preprepared.",
        "Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I\u2019m on the spot. I don\u2019t know. Um\u2026 you know what? I think I\u2019m good.",
        "Nope. When Jo\u2019s here, can you work in \u201cShagadelic, baby,\u201d at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?",
        "",
        "Well, I don\u2019t know about that. Just wasn\u2019t for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?",
        "Yep.",
        "Hey, Dwight. What\u2019s up?",
        "Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There\u2019s no debating that. But, I will say\u2026 in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby.",
        "He never called a meeting.",
        "Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?",
        "Really?",
        "\u2026What is it?",
        "You could just be saying it to get the job.",
        "How about this. Why don\u2019t you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.",
        "Okay.",
        "Did you just trademark that\u2026",
        "We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch\u2019s new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone\u2019s bound to be, right?  And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I\u2019m not too worried. But I\u2019m really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe.  Did you know that Gabe\u2019s last name was Lewis? I had no idea.",
        "Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.",
        "Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.",
        "Can you\u2026  You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence\u2026 would be\u2026 in a dialogue with a subordinate?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "He creeps me out.  But, I think he might be a genius.",
        "Oh.",
        "Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?",
        "So I think all we need is a resume, and we\u2019ll be good right?",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s no big deal, just something that looks like that.  Cool?",
        "Can I ask why you\u2019re leaving your current job?",
        "Is this a bad time to be doing this?",
        "Andy? You all set?",
        "So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?",
        "Is it?",
        "Your department\u2019s just you, right?",
        "Good!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Peepa.",
        "Great.",
        "No.",
        "You\u2019re not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.",
        "Okay. That\u2019s vivid.",
        "Yikes.",
        "Well, you know how I like taking bribes.",
        "Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn\u2019t trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Great.",
        "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine.",
        "Howard Cline?",
        "Oh\u2026 Deshaun Williams.",
        "He\u2019s an amazing man. He\u2019s a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser\u2026",
        "Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys.",
        "That\u2019s very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?",
        "I think that\u2019s probably all we need to hear from\u2026",
        "That\u2019s very\u2026",
        "You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.",
        "No, not at all. In fact, I\u2019m not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I\u2019m just gonna pick a name out of the hat.",
        "Uh\u2013",
        "Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.",
        "No, was it good?",
        "Oh, I know this guy.  Hello! Mr. \u201cSoo-ven-yay.\u201d Mr. \u201cJacques Soo-ven-yay.\u201d Nice to meet you. It says here you\u2019re French.  So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.",
        "Assistant to the Regional Manager.",
        "What is it?",
        "Oh, that\u2019s my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn\u2019t hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That\u2019s a travesty.",
        "No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you\u2019re Dwight, and then\u2026 he\u2019s the\u2026",
        "Ohhhh!",
        "This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, \u201cjust making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.\u201d",
        "Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.",
        "Um\u2026 why Kelly?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, I didn\u2019t know you knew her?",
        "No.",
        "You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn\u2019t a good fit.",
        "All right. Name.",
        "Thank you, Mr. Schnoot.  We will let you know.",
        "I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.",
        "All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let\u2019s discuss.",
        "Yes.",
        "Thank you, Dwight.",
        "Well, that was quick.",
        "He\u2019s not a real candidate.",
        "You took the deal.",
        "That\u2019s not okay.",
        "What is happening right now?",
        "No, why would you think that?",
        "Okay.  Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.",
        "No, no, no. Not ever, \u2019cause that\u2019s not gonna happen.",
        "Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I\u2019m going a little bit crazy.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?",
        "I suppose I am.",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay.",
        "Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-",
        "Hey! Hey! Hey!",
        "What about Darryl? We can all agree that he\u2019s a stand-up guy, right?",
        "What? No, no, it\u2019s not a vote.",
        "I don\u2019t know. This conversation really got away from me.",
        "No, they can\u2019t. That\u2019s not how this is gonna work.  We\u2019re going in this room, we\u2019re going to have a meeting. We\u2019re gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she\u2019s gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay?  What the hell happened out there?",
        "The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California\u2026 for the manager position. Who took one look around and left. He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO\u2026 CEO\u2026 her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don\u2019t really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill. And he chose\u2026",
        "Oh, yeah. Pregnant.",
        "No, I told you I don\u2019t like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.",
        "No one should be planking at all.",
        "You watching that commercial again?  Why do you keep watching it, if you know it\u2019s just gonna make you cry?",
        "He\u2019s got a bank vault. That\u2019s a start.",
        "The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he\u2019s gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it\u2019s not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It\u2019s strange.",
        "Can I call you right back? Thank you very much.  Okay.  What is this?",
        "It\u2019s, it\u2019s nothing.",
        "It\u2019s just a list of our names, split into two columns.",
        "Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?",
        "No. Okay. Um, I\u2019ll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?",
        "We don\u2019t need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-",
        "I promise you, we don\u2019t need a warning-",
        "Left.",
        "Why are you- How do you know?",
        "Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert\u2019s notebook.",
        "Okay, it\u2019s not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.",
        "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s-",
        "That\u2019s not it.",
        "Mmum, still wrong.",
        "Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!",
        "Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.",
        "Hey. It\u2019s nothing. Alright? I\u2019ll text you when we get there. Let you know what\u2019s going on.",
        "Nope. No dog video.",
        "Okay. See you guys.",
        "Uhhh, the street?",
        "Oh, I didn\u2019t know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah, she does like Elmo.",
        "Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?",
        "Shhh.",
        "Alright, I\u2019m gonna go warm up the car.",
        "Ryan? A little help?",
        "Uh, I will have the chicken piccata with a side salad.",
        "Good. What? Nothin\u2019",
        "I don\u2019t think we have to do this again cause it\u2019s gonna take a whole.",
        "Come on, man.",
        "Hey, so this isn\u2019t matching up with this\u2026and I\u2019m not sure which one\u2019s right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?",
        "Alright.",
        "Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?",
        "Yeah, alright Kev why don\u2019t you come with us?",
        "Does it save time though? \u2018Cause we\u2019ve been here for about an hour.",
        "K, Kevin, are you saying \u201cSee the world\u201d? or \u201cSea World?\u201d",
        "No, see? Right there, that\u2019s the problem with your method. \u2018Cause I still don\u2019t know if you\u2019re saying \u201cSea World\u201d or \u201csee the world,\u201d and it\u2019s taking a lot of time to explain it.",
        "How many L to a K?",
        "I\u2019ll take five.",
        "Your ex-wife?",
        "Wow. Alright. Can\u2019t wait to meet her.",
        "Hey.",
        "Why don\u2019t you start?",
        "He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?",
        "New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door\u2026",
        "She looks at it when she\u2019s on the potty, and she makes the faces.",
        "We know that.",
        "You have a walking buddy.",
        "What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?",
        "But, what if?",
        "I don\u2019t know, for such a crazy number I\u2019d like something pretty crazy.",
        "That\u2019s pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?",
        "Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?",
        "Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case\u2026let\u2019s get to work.",
        "I can have it to you by the beginning of next week.  Alright? Thanks very much.  Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?",
        "Ok.",
        "Andrew.",
        "No, I didn\u2019t notice anything.",
        "I don\u2019t know what to tell you, man.",
        "Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.",
        "Nah, you definitely weren\u2019t kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in.",
        "Yeah. Big sale. Don\u2019t worry about it though, I don\u2019t really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though\u2026 Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald\u2026can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much.",
        "and I\u2019m back. How are you sir?\u2026.I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?",
        "Gettin\u2019 psyched up?",
        "Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this\u2026",
        "I mean, do you like it? You having fun?  Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun\u2026.and you did that.",
        "But I think it\u2019s big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea\u2026.which, by the way, I can\u2019t wait for.",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "Pull up your pants.",
        "I\u2019d hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70\u2019s theme party, or a 70\u2019s theme meeting, or a 70\u2019s theme convention\u2026",
        "1870\u2019s\u2026",
        "Nope, he means tuna dog.",
        "Do Snowboarders hate animals?",
        "Dwight! At least aim it.",
        "Whoa whoa whoa whoa!",
        "Alright! Nice job, Oscar!",
        "So\u2026ah, who\u2019s gonna take the dog?",
        "What if he jumps out the window and runs away?",
        "Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s pretty good.",
        "Nice job.",
        "Oh man, it\u2019s gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.",
        "I mean, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019d do with all that money.",
        "No, I\u2019d probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I\u2019d either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.",
        "Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?",
        "Which ideally would be me\u2026.",
        "Stop. I\u2019m a barista in your fantasy?",
        "I don\u2019t know about Stephen King, I mean\u2026",
        "Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you\u2026",
        "OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That\u2019s seventy-five boxes per person, so that\u2019s not so bad.",
        "Nice.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!",
        "There\u2019s gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.",
        "Yeah  Not that they\u2019re not smart people.",
        "I\u2019d go with that.",
        "Not that, don\u2019t\u2026",
        "It\u2019s a great idea Kev, I don\u2019t think it applies here though, so maybe we just-",
        "Our fake winnings",
        "It is, yeah. I mean I just don\u2019t know why I\u2019m compromising if it\u2019s my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it\u2019s Maine and you love it.",
        "Nope. You\u2019re, you\u2019re doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now.",
        "A\u2026hot chocolate tea",
        "Kevin Costner.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, it\u2019s not the dumbest idea.",
        "But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.",
        "So sadly, it\u2019s the best idea on the table.",
        "Is he OK?",
        "OK, alright, that\u2019s\u2026look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.",
        "That\u2019s alright.",
        "Doesn\u2019t matter what the name is. Se\u00f1or Loadenstein, that\u2019s stupid.",
        "That\u2019s OK, we\u2019re good.",
        "Porque es muy rapido.",
        "Right. It\u2019s city and country combined.",
        "And I can fish right from the window of Pam\u2019s pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.",
        "Just like now\u2026.too bad the schools are terrible.",
        "But what are you gonna do about that?",
        "Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we\u2019re basically there.",
        "Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.",
        "Dammit Dwight!",
        "Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?",
        "Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don\u2019t know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.",
        "So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright!",
        "Whoa whoa whoa!",
        "No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You\u2019re way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard!  Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.",
        "Good.",
        "Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.",
        "You\u2019ve seen it, right?",
        "There\u2019s this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there\u2019s an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a\u2026 phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it\u2019ll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.",
        "Okay, don\u2019t be gross.",
        "Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?",
        "So, we\u2019ve typed in the address, now let\u2019s take a look at the street view.",
        "Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?",
        "I\u2019m actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing.  I\u2019ve only sold one copy.",
        "Chapter 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.",
        "Oh, hey, how are you doing, I\u2019m Jim.",
        "No.",
        "No, no, no, no, no. No.",
        "Chapter 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c One of the host\u2019s most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.",
        "Chapter 9 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.",
        "Closing ceremonies.",
        "I think I left my wallet in your house.",
        "Right here.",
        "Keys, keys\u2026",
        "I didn\u2019t forget them, they\u2019re right here.",
        "I\u2019m so sorry, I think I forgot that thing\u2026",
        "Whoo.",
        "Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?",
        "Chapter seven: The host should always present something spectacular to draw the eye of his guests.",
        "I don\u2019t know if I can.",
        "Alright.",
        "I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.",
        "No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?",
        "Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?",
        "Mmhmm. No, but what I\u2019m saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?",
        "Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.",
        "Hey it\u2019s Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I\u2019ve read a lot about this really great documentary.",
        "It\u2019s called Ghostbusters.",
        "It didn\u2019t have a buster sign around him?  Why don\u2019t you draw him?  Why don\u2019t we see this whole thing.",
        "I ain\u2019t fraid of no ghost.  Whoa!",
        "You know that\u2019s\u2026",
        "I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.",
        "Party looks fun doesn\u2019t it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.",
        "Are you serious?",
        "That\u2019s funny.  Ok.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Careful, whoa. First of all, it\u2019s not like I think that\u2019s going to help the Eagles win.",
        "No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It\u2019s not\u2026",
        "Thank you.",
        "Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, \u201cMom, there\u2019s a ghost in my closet.\u201d Now, you say one of two things \u2013 one, \u201cYou\u2019re just having a bad dream,\u201d or two, \u201cLet\u2019s go see what it was.\u201d",
        "Ok.",
        "Oh, come on!",
        "Pink is the red-",
        "I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.",
        "Oscar, how are you on that side?",
        "But that would make more sense.",
        "\u2026W R K.",
        "Uh no it\u2019s W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that\u2019s what you are hearing.",
        "I\u2019m just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby\u2019s in a really good place now. So\u00e2\u20ac my pitch is\u00e2\u20ac me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.",
        "Is that off again?",
        "Ok.",
        "Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?",
        "Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.",
        "Dwight, question.",
        "If this doomsday device goes off\u2026",
        "If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?",
        "Ok.",
        "Nope.",
        "Hmm\u00e2\u20ac Heda.  No.",
        "Ok, where is he?",
        "I\u2019ll try both.",
        "Robert.",
        "Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.",
        "You up for a game?",
        "Exactly. Here we go. Let\u2019s do it.",
        "Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving.",
        "In the box.",
        "Is that my phone?",
        "Nah, I think it\u2019s mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.",
        "Oh, oh yeah.",
        "Yes. Right now? Yes.",
        "Here you go.",
        "Awww, sorry. Did it break?",
        "You sure?",
        "What kinda iPhone is that?",
        "Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?",
        "Ha ha. No, I don\u2019t. No, I don\u2019t. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so-",
        "Ah! Classic, right?",
        "I\u2019m alright.",
        "Yep.",
        "Yep. Ah. Oh.",
        "Yeah. That does not feel good.",
        "Ok, he didn\u2019t fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.",
        "I wasn\u2019t here that day.",
        "No- Ok. Well, we\u2019ll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?",
        "Ok, this is crazy.",
        "I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80\u2019s movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don\u2019t do that, I think I\u2019ll be alright.",
        "Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?",
        "No? Come on.",
        "Well, that is\u2026 because you didn\u2019t realize that\u2026 I was left-handed.",
        "Hmm. Doubt it.",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we\u2019d save her from Ryan right?",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah. Super pretty.",
        "The temp?",
        "Nope.",
        "And I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t.",
        "No, I don\u2019t.",
        "No, I\u2019m not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I\u2019m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It\u2019s true, but it doesn\u2019t help anybody.",
        "Okay. Uh, I don\u2019t. So are we good?",
        "Oh, I stand corrected.",
        "Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Not his mom\u2019s car.",
        "Touche?",
        "Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I\u2019m in the clear. If that wasn\u2019t for the matchmaker test, then\u2026 Cathy, he\u2019s a really nice guy.",
        "Dwight!",
        "Dwight! Dwight!",
        "Sorry about that.",
        "Dwight!  Why?",
        "Leave.",
        "Mm-hmm?",
        "Told you.",
        "You okay?",
        "Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?",
        "Stop shoving me.",
        "Really?",
        "Si.",
        "Okay, Dwight, come on.  You can go first.",
        "Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.",
        "No, I\u2019m not worried. Because this lie isn\u2019t for me, it\u2019s for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back\u2026 yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven\u2019t had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.",
        "No.",
        "I am not lying.",
        "Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?",
        "Yeah, but I don\u2019t smoke.",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "Okay, easy. Trust me, I\u2019m around for the long-haul.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Oh okay, she\u2019s going into labor. Make way, everybody!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Okay guys, here we go! We\u2019ll see you!",
        "How do you feel?",
        "Cool. Thanks.",
        "Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?",
        "No, of course we\u2019re not tourists. We\u2019re just people that aren\u2019t from here who are taking a tour.",
        "By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s what I had for breakfast and I think that\u2019s probably why I\u2019m still hungry.",
        "Only two hundred dollars?",
        "Oh wow.  So that\u2019s two miles if you incorporate the walk back.",
        "Yeah sorry everyone else didn\u2019t come.  I think they\u2019re just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Andy \u2013 this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It\u2019s just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you\u2019re our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don\u2019t have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don\u2019t believe me take a look at what\u2019s on my head.  I\u2019m wearing a very pink hat.  I\u2019ve been getting weird looks all day because I\u2019m pretty sure \u201cDM does GB\u201d means something kinda sexual.  But guess who\u2019s wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That\u2019s huge.",
        "They\u2019re terrible.",
        "Tuna?",
        "And to drink?",
        "Oh-ho, I am in.",
        "I\u2019m excited, I\u2019ve actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I\u2019m older now, I can outrun a zombie.",
        "Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?",
        "It\u2019s locked.",
        "That\u2019s weird, if it\u2019s not locked, why isn\u2019t it opening?",
        "Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I\u2019m gonna find him.",
        "We didn\u2019t have one scheduled.",
        "Hey guys let\u2019s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight\u2019s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he\u2019s never, ever going to go back on it right?",
        "What are you up to? Oops look out!",
        "Prank!",
        "You know what it\u2019s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?",
        "Because you\u2019re sitting?",
        "Ok.",
        "Because you\u2019re sitting?",
        "You know I have to do this.",
        "I think you could just do Andy Bernard.",
        "I don\u2019t know. He wasn\u2019t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn\u2019t hire his wife.",
        "Well it\u2019s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.",
        "Well it\u2019s not that easy. It\u2019s kind of sometimes difficult.",
        "No, I don\u2019t think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it\u2019s doing.",
        "Oh, wow. So cute.",
        "Very cute.",
        "Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open\u2026 uh, okay.",
        "Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow.  Creed. I was never here, all right?",
        "Oh boy.",
        "Do I?",
        "I know, I do.",
        "I really wish I could help. I\u2019m not really sure how I can\u2026",
        "That\u2019s the thing. See, I didn\u2019t want to get in the middle of this. Still don\u2019t. But here\u2019s something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.",
        "Perfect!",
        "Yes?",
        "I don\u2019t know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I\u2019m here. And between us, she\u2019s on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don\u2019t know how this helps, but it\u2019s just what I\u2019m thinking.",
        "Yes. All right. Great.",
        "This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I\u2019m not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley\u2019s tie is really the story of the day\u2026",
        "Ok, so that\u2019s a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It\u2019s pretty smart, right?  Hi, how you doing? I\u2019m Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.",
        "You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I\u2019ll just be in, you know.",
        "I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. \u2026Might not have been the best idea.",
        "She\u2019s not your grandmother, is she?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It wasn\u2019t me.",
        "Kathy wants to leave our clump?",
        "Ow, What are you doing?",
        "Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.",
        "What was that?",
        "Can\u2019t do that.",
        "Ah\u2026 I\u2019m gonna s-",
        "Dwight really wants my bonus. He\u2019s trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can\u2019t drink at this thing\u2026.I get really pranky when I drink.",
        "Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card\u2026you want the number? Oh it\u2019s uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.",
        "So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife\u2026from me.",
        "I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?",
        "Hmm\u2026",
        "Nice try, this is ridiculous.",
        "Three times.",
        "Andy, you\u2019ve gotta be kidding me.",
        "OK, you know what? Why don\u2019t we just call animal control\u2026",
        "Yes, I\u2019m calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.",
        "Uh, I don\u2019t know, let me ask.  Uh, were you quilled?",
        "And what\u2019s it\u2019s name?",
        "Oops.",
        "Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk.  Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?",
        "Yes. It is.",
        "I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.",
        "I don\u2019t-",
        "Yeah.",
        "O\u2026K.",
        "Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn\u2019t have got you involved because the truth is, I don\u2019t even really care about this picture, it\u2019s a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like\u2026",
        "Right. You\u2019re right. So maybe it was me who did it\u2026by accident.",
        "I\u2019ll figure it out, get to the bottom of it\u2026.Merry merry.",
        "You alright, Santa?",
        "Yes.",
        "Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.",
        "OK.",
        "Alright. I will definitely do that.",
        "You know what? You\u2019re sitting, and thinking, and it\u2019s probably better if it comes from me anyway.",
        "Yes. They totally do.",
        "Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something\u2026\u2026C\u2019mon, Jim.  I got nothin\u2019.",
        "Cathy wants to leave our clump?",
        "Sorry it didn\u2019t work out. Hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.",
        "That\u2019s ok.",
        "That\u2019d be great, thank you.",
        "All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let\u2019s try again. Get it all out now if you have to.",
        "Okay, done.",
        "All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-",
        "You can write a book about chairs.",
        "Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don\u2019t know what paper is.",
        "Stop right there. I love it.",
        "In Philadelphia.",
        "That\u2019s a great idea.",
        "Yeah.",
        "All right, good stuff.",
        "I thought it was a fun idea.",
        "Okay.",
        "There\u2019s a table over here.",
        "Shawn Marion.",
        "Wrong, for so many reasons.",
        "Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.",
        "All right.",
        "Andy, it\u2019s the last day of the quarter. We\u2019ve already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.",
        "Andy, we\u2019re gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point\u2026whatever percent is pretty good.",
        "It\u2019s always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she\u2019s out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I\u2019ve found out what he likes. And it\u2019s really weird.",
        "I know.",
        "Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.",
        "You know, there\u2019s a glare from over here\u2026 oh wow, that\u2019s magnificent.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, I thought you were making a joke.",
        "I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.",
        "Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.",
        "DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.",
        "You\u2019re looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don\u2019t mean to brag, but New Year\u2019s Eve, I was home by nine.",
        "Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.",
        "I bet I should.  That\u2019s beautiful, I\u2019m going to email that to you.",
        "All right-",
        "I must\u2026",
        "Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night\u2019s been magical.",
        "Really? Why?",
        "Good night.",
        "To both these bears.",
        "To madness.",
        "Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "And there\u2019s my talking point.",
        "To the shame room!",
        "Hey.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was pretty uneventful, actually.",
        "Uh, hit and run.",
        "Nope. Not guilty.",
        "We\u2019re best friends, actually. We\u2019re going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.",
        "Okay.",
        "I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn\u2019t think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.",
        "Aw man, I would but I can\u2019t miss any more work.",
        "Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-",
        "Wow, I\u2019m really sorry.",
        "I never considered that my week off would make everyone else\u2019s job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.",
        "So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.",
        "Oh man, Ernesto\u2019s. That was our favorite restaurant too.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Okay, wait, wait.",
        "No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn\u2019t listening to you.",
        "\u2026and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn\u2019t matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.",
        "Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?",
        "Uh-",
        "The empanada guy!",
        "Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.",
        "Because my car broke down.",
        "Well, I think you handled it pretty well.",
        "Okay, listen, all right? Dwight\u2019s on to us, he\u2019s going to figure it out really soon, so let\u2019s just get ahead of it, let\u2019s tell the truth.",
        "Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone\u2019s attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I\u2019m really sorry, I didn\u2019t know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you\u2019re going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.",
        "Funny? No? Nobody laughing?",
        "Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.",
        "You want a giraffe?",
        "Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.",
        "Whoa, no, no. That\u2019s overdoing it, I think.",
        "Split the difference?",
        "Okay, let\u2019s go.",
        "What?",
        "Wow, what a surprise. That\u2019s crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.",
        "Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?",
        "That was a great idea.",
        "Oh my goodness, let\u2019s take a look at these. They\u2019re usually amazing, so let\u2019s see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.",
        "Oh, Aunt Phyllis.",
        "You know what? I don\u2019t think you need to do things on command. That\u2019s very weird. I\u2019ll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?",
        "I don\u2019t know what else we can do here.",
        "It\u2019s okay.",
        "All right, all right. Okay.",
        "All right, I know, I know. Let\u2019s just get this.",
        "I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?",
        "Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?",
        "Cece!",
        "Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we\u2019re going home, we\u2019re going home. We\u2019re going home, we\u2019re going home. I know, I know, bud.",
        "I know, I know.",
        "I\u2019m gonna grab her, okay.",
        "Hi, all right. I\u2019m just going to go down to the car and I\u2019m going to put her in her seat and I\u2019ll be right back up.",
        "No, no, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll be right back.",
        "Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let\u2019s go.",
        "I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that\u2019s not happening, I\u2019m not averse to just buying them all off.",
        "Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it\u2019s always buried behind like a ton of black licorice?  Bought it all. Now it\u2019s like red city in there. So, enjoy it.",
        "Uh, I can\u2019t get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can\u2019t\u2026",
        "Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right?",
        "It\u2019s not really food, right?",
        "Ok, ok, ok.",
        "\u201cAnd shove it up my butt.\u201d",
        "I\u2019m not gonna eat it.",
        "I\u2019m not-",
        "They hate me, Pam.",
        "No, it\u2019s bad. Darryl canceled go-karting\u2026.",
        "It\u2019s a lunch thing.",
        "I feel like a stranger in my own country.",
        "Ok. Well, hey, you\u2019re not here. You don\u2019t know, Ok? It\u2019s intense. They made me eat black licorice.",
        "Oh ho! Look who\u2019s back reporting for duty.",
        "Nope. It\u2019s over.",
        "Nope. OK.",
        "Ooh, me three.",
        "I just got a text from Robert California that says \u201cbring your clubs to Florida\u201d.",
        "I hope not.  Because I am not going. Two question marks?",
        "\u201cRobert, Hey!\u201d Exclamation point.",
        "\u201cGot your text, awesome idea. Let\u2019s hit the links next time you\u2019re in PA\u201d Dash JH.",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s a golf text.",
        "Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.",
        "Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.",
        "Ok, sending.",
        "Really did  He responded L-O-L.",
        "Now, is it too dark to say that Cici\u2019s having an operation?",
        "I think you\u2019re right.",
        "Total nightmare.",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. They\u2019re incredibly helpful, you\u2019re lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won\u2019t even know I\u2019m gone.",
        "You know Dwight, if you didn\u2019t want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn\u2019t go.",
        "Hold on, just wanna get it on camera.",
        "Essential.",
        "Alright, I\u2019m gonna pack my trunks.",
        "Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that\u2019s gonna make us roomates.",
        "Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you\u2019re showering. Save some water.",
        "Is that the buzzer from Taboo?",
        "Mosquito.",
        "So, what is this special project?",
        "That sounds awesome.",
        "Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?",
        "Bye.",
        "I will.",
        "I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I\u2019m up and at \u2019em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn\u2019t know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-",
        "Puppet.",
        "Yeah. It\u2019s weird being away from them. Never done this before.",
        "Are you sure it\u2019s stress? Because I did poison you.",
        "Oh no, I\u2019m serious. I was thinking, \u201cFor this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?\u201d and then I thought of it. I\u2019ll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?",
        "That\u2019s a good one.  Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?",
        "Yes.",
        "Loggins and Messina.",
        "Man.",
        "Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.",
        "I would love to hear the other mottos.",
        "No way.",
        "It was-",
        "You got to stop with the antacids. It\u2019s not the antidote.",
        "Okay.",

        "All right, guys. It didn\u2019t work out for any of us, so\u2026 we\u2019re still on the same team. Let me get these.",
        "But you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a chance.",
        "Oh, man, I\u2019d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.",
        "Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?",
        "That sounds lovely.",
        "I know why you\u2019re doing this, Dwight.",
        "Last week, I may have gone too far. I\u2019ll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And\u2026 you can fill in the rest.",
        "Now he\u2019s trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it\u2019s fair to be cautious.",
        "How\u2019s it going, man?",
        "Great, yeah, good.",
        "Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?",
        "Pam? No!",
        "No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight\u2019s photo studio slash trap.",
        "No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.",
        "Nope.",
        "But are you a hundred percent sure? I don\u2019t think any of us are.",
        "Nope.",
        "That\u2019s-",
        "That\u2019s-",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.",
        "Alright. Why don\u2019t you just-",
        "-give him to me and\u2026 perfect.",
        "This is great.",
        "Excuse me.",
        "Just do it.",
        "Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.",
        "Let\u2019s do it, shoot it.",
        "Great.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Oh, so that\u2019s it?",
        "No, no, see? This is what we\u2019re talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you\u2019re not drunk\u2026",
        "Oh boy.",
        "Andy, come on.",
        "Hey.",
        "Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.",
        "You are really good at modesty. She's a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids' room. There's a hippo leading a parade of 500 children\u00e2\u20ac\u201d",
        "Oh, yeah",
        "Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.",
        "In Philly, so, that doesn't really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.",
        "An Altima or better.",
        "we good?",
        "No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith's face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.",
        "Done. Explain.",
        "Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.",
        "The new guys called one.",
        "Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?",
        "You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect.  Too easy.",
        "You a sports fan?",
        "Oh. Any team sports?",
        "Phillies fan, though, right?",
        "No, like baseball. A baseball team.",
        "Ok. Good talk.",
        "I have nothing in common with Plop.",
        "Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing.  Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.",
        "Yeah. You know what? I'll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.",
        "Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye.  Yeah!",
        "Spinning would be more fun.",
        "Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma's got breakfast, OK?  We are going to Roy's wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife's ex-fianc\u00c3\u00a9's wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it's your wife's ex-fianc\u00c3\u00a9.",
        "A banana?",
        "Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.",
        "Just\u00e2\u20ac  so weird.",
        "Is this his house?",
        "OK.",
        "Uh, my ex-fianc\u00c3\u00a9.",
        "I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn't know. Um\u00e2\u20ac  actually I did tell Pam and we decided \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno'. But, then I decided \u2018yes\u2019 anyway. So, I'm thinking there's another conversation coming. And, it's hard to know when that will be.",
        "There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?",
        "Thanks for inviting us, by the way-",
        "That was, that was a surprise.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "By the way, man, this place is\u2026 beautiful.",
        "Gravel company?",
        "Not gravel, obviously.  No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-",
        "Yeah, you never know.",
        "OK, Kenny.",
        "He plays piano?",
        "Definitely.",
        "Courtside seats. Sixers.",
        "It was an away game.",
        "No.",
        "Um, ok.",
        "Oh, here\u2019s one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-",
        "You heard that one.",
        "That I thought we were millionaires.",
        "That\u2019s all right.",
        "You all right?",
        "Ready?",
        "John Stamos.",
        "Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what\u2019d they say? That\u2019s awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!",
        "It\u2019s not even real yet. And I\u2019m not gonna tell her \u2019til it\u2019s real.",
        "I\u2019m sorry. This is for a news audition?",
        "I can feel you looking at me.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "That didn\u2019t happen. You would\u2019ve told me right away.",
        "Uh\u2026",
        "God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.",
        "Don\u2019t worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I\u2019ve been wanting to try.",
        "That was really good, Darryl.",
        "Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me\u2014.",
        "Pam always says I look like Nixon. That\u2019s crazy, right? I mean there\u2019s nothing there. True\u2014 Oh no.",
        "You doing alright, man?",
        "Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.",
        "Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?",
        "No, I\u2019m serious. There\u2019s always something better.",
        "Like hypothetically\u2026 if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.",
        "Something cool. Like, sports marketing or\u2026 that sound something like you\u2019d be into?",
        "Right?",
        "Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you\u2019d have to\u2026",
        "Right?",
        "Not even a thought!  It\u2019s not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!",
        "Oh, it\u2019s happening!  Let\u2019s just keep it between you and me for right now.",
        "We, uh, we haven\u2019t talked about. But I think that she\u2019s\u2014I think she understands\u2026 what this is.",
        "What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!",
        "Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?",
        "I don\u2019t know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.",
        "I deserved that.",
        "Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?",
        "I think I got it right here. <i></i>",
        "You got it.",
        "Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly\u2026the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham!  Gotta go through me first.",
        "Getting my wife a week off from work.",
        "Awesome, right?",
        "Well, I don\u2019t know about the rest of you but I\u2019m just gonna say it. I\u2019m nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause.",

        "Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.",
        "What?",
        "What?",
        "Alright, alright, gang. Let\u2019s just settle down. You\u2019re yelling in her face.",

        "Pam, I\u2019m really sorry. I- I\u2019m really sorry about\u2026all that.  Really? Smirking?",
        "Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?",
        "Andy!",
        "You\u2019re the boss. Don\u2019t you think we\u2019d all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?",

        "OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.",
        "Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!",
        "Oh no, I\u2019m gonna push him. You know why? Because you\u2019re getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He\u2019s trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won\u2019t get there. Is that what we want?!",
        "What do we want?!",
        "When do we want it?!",
        "That\u2019s impossible.  Dwight!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "You know he\u2019s doing all this on purpose.",
        "Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-",
        "What?",
        "Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.",
        "No.",
        "I\u2019ll take it.",
        "Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.",
        "That doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "Ok\u2026that\u2019s not\u2026",
        "Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we\u2019re all kinda like your children?",
        "Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..",
        "OK. And they\u2019re all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there\u2019s only one guy who can save them. It\u2019s not me.",
        "It\u2019s pretty good actually.",
        "We bonded. We got to-",

        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to\u2026",
        "Yeah.",
        "What is it?",
        "Um, oh man, I don't actually know.",
        "They weren't really talking that much about money. They just said, We're good with investing and then I\u2026and I\u2026",
        "No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.",
        "You weren't there.",
        "It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had\u2026we should talk about it later.",
        "Pam.",
        "We'll talk about it later.",
        "I thought that concert was pretty great.",

        "Uh\u2026",
        "Okay. We'll, just forget it.",
        "Because it is Halloween. So if you're going to sing a concert, it's a good idea to throw that one in.",
        "And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.",
        "Competent.",
        "Dwight!",
        "No, you chose yourself.",
        "Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.",
        "See these forms\u2026",
        "What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!",

        "You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?",
        "What? Yeah, right. As if.",
        "Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.",
        "I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.",
        "Hey David, how would you like a guy who\u2019s not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?",
        "This is gonna be awful.",
        "I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.",
        "Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I\u2019m gone.",

        "How about this\u2013 You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?",
        "All right.",
        "You know, truth be told, I think all you\u2019ll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I\u2019m gone.",
        "You know, at the end of the day, it\u2019s really only two days. I mean, I\u2019ll be back in the office. If you need me for an emergency, call me. I\u2019ll be there\u2026",
        "Tell me about it.",
        "All right. You know what? Maybe we\u2019ll just\u2026 We\u2019ll go slow.",

        "Oh, it\u2019s like naughty or nice.",
        "Quick question\u2013Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?",
        "Oh, nice. Did you check that list?",
        "But more than once? \u2019cause you could have made a mistake.",
        "Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you\u2019re gonna find out who\u2019s\u2013",
        "Damn.",
        "Ooh.",
        "Oh, you know what? I gotta go.",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s all right.",
        "I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.",
        "Yeah, I know, I\u2019d just like to settle in and get a good night\u2019s sleep.",
        "Ooh.",
        "That\u2019s right.",
        "Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.",
        "You know what? Yeah. Have at it.",
        "Ooh! Are you nuts?",
        "Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn\u2019t hit anybody that hard.",
        "Just\u2013Just\u2013Hey!",
        "That\u2019s enough, I\u2019m done! Okay? Agh!",
        "Aah! Ow!",
        "Oh\u2026what was that? Now I\u2019m gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God.  One second. Oh\u2026",
        "I\u2019m probably never gonna see you again.",
        "Okay, sorry, sorry.",
        "Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.",
        "I\u2019ll call you when I get in.",
        "All right.",
        "Love you.",
        "Yep, I did say that.",
        "What\u2019s going on? Where\u2019s the belsnickel?",
        "What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.",
        "No. I just missed my wife.",
        "And I found out that there\u2019s a bus at 5:00 a.m.",
        "Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog.  Thanks, Phyllis. Where\u2019s Andy?",
        "Oh, hey, man.  Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They\u2019re gonna bring you in for an interview.",
        "Right?",
        "Hey, of course.",
        "Thank you, sir.",
        "Go get \u2019em.",
        "I think they\u2019re going to the conference finals.",
        "Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don\u2019t even-\u2026",
        "I bit my lip at lunch today.",
        "Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.",
        "Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the\u2026",
        "Whatever. It\u2019s not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that\u2019s gonna happen\u2026 You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That\u2019s it, I\u2019m going home!",
        "I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam\u2019s face because let\u2019s be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.",
        "You sound tired. Everything ok?",
        "Uhh, a little bit. It\u2019s a lot of pressure, you know, but that\u2019s what I signed up for right?",
        "Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.",
        "Ok",
        "Thanks!",
        "Love you too. Bye.",
        "Oh man, that\u2019s fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?",
        "Oh no, no, no. That\u2019s ok.  Um I\u2019m sorry, is this the conference center?",
        "You gotta be kidding me.",
        "Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.",
        "Listen, I don\u2019t mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.",
        "Alright.  Oh, sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s my wife, can I take this?",
        "Right!  Hey, what\u2019s up? Everything ok?",
        "It\u2019s still happening right now actually, so uh\u2026",
        "Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything\u2019s okay?",
        "Okay, bye.  So sorry about that.",
        "I love it.",
        "Okay, I\u2019m Kareem. That makes total sense. I\u2019m Kareem. You\u2019re Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.",
        "And that\u2019s all?",
        "No one will believe this back home, but that\u2019s okay. Let me show you how it\u2019s done.",
        "This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.",
        "Sorry, Stinky, can\u2019t do it. Too busy.",
        "Okay. There\u2019s no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.",
        "Hey, I\u2019m in Philadelphia right now.",
        "Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?",
        "No, I hear what you\u2019re saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?",
        "Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.",
        "Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it.  Hey! How are you?",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "That\u2019s so great!",
        "It\u2019s pretty great, right? I mean, we\u2019re coming along\u2026  Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis\u2019s timeline",
        "Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.",
        "Well, I mean, I don\u2019t even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so\u2026 These things go down all the time.",
        "Are you cool to just hang out?",
        "Yeah?  You ready?",
        "Let\u2019s do it!",
        "Mm-hm",
        "And as you know, I was a paper salesman.  Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked.",
        "Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They\u2019re going to make you pay for the fish, and\u2026 they wanted to know when you can start.",
        "I think I\u2019m a little too busy these days to s\u2014  Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.",
        "The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.",
        ": Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end \u2026",
        "\u2026and finds the\u2026 fake grail? No grail?",
        "I don\u2019t.",
        "Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.",
        "Hey.",
        "Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.",
        "Cece\u2019s ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I\u2019ve been working with her on her move. It\u2019s called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It\u2019s kind of like this. It\u2019s pretty cute, right?",
        "Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.",
        "Yeah. Even you.",
        "Bye, Dwight.",
        "Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.",
        "Hey. I was just about to call you.",
        "I am still in Philly, actually.",
        "It\u2019s insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I\u2019m stuck here trying to keep him on board.",
        "Pam, I couldn\u2019t get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.",
        "You\u2019re gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy\u2019s gonna record it. So we\u2019ll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?",
        "Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?",
        "Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you\u2019re not the best with the phone.",
        "Bye.  Yep. See, you\u2019ve still got to press \u201cEnd,\u201d Pam.",
        "Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he\u2019s gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s\u2013",
        "Oh, actually\u2026 uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he\u2019ll be calling in any second.",
        "Hey.",
        "We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It\u2019s like everything I did, he just wouldn\u2019t go for it.",
        "I have no idea where we\u2019re gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.",
        "Can you figure out how to upload Cece\u2019s dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.",
        "You\u2019re not serious, are you? You didn\u2019t get any of the recital?",
        "Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.",
        "Oh, great. So we\u2019ll see somebody else\u2019s kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it\u2019s really not that hard to film a video.",
        "Look, Pam, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It\u2019s gone. That moment\u2019s just gone. I missed it.",
        "You\u2019re not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I\u2019m in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You\u2019ve agreed to this.",
        "Pam, I\u2019m not explaining this to you\u2013 Pam, I\u2019m not going over this again.",
        "I don\u2019t know how else to tell you, okay? I\u2019m doing everything I can every week to bring home something\u2026",
        "I\u2019m doing this just for me? Is that what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m doing it just for me. If that\u2019s what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?",
        "We\u2019ll talk tomorrow?",
        "Okay. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.",
        "You could\u2019ve just called that an alliance too, right?",
        "Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that\u2019s only gonna make things worse.",
        "I\u2019m talking to him this afternoon, but don\u2019t get your hopes up.",
        "Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we\u2019re scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix \u2013 me asking the boss of the company I\u2019m abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So\u2026 problem solved. Thanks, guys.",
        "I\u2019m on the phone. I\u2019m on the phone.",
        "I\u2019m just gonna call you back. Thanks.",
        "I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just nervous.",
        "Sure, yeah, go ahead.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You\u2019re clean, right?",
        "Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don\u2019t listen to it at all because we\u2019re at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so\u2014",
        "Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.",
        "Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.",
        "I need you to breathe in my face right now.",
        "What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?",
        "I knew it, I knew it.",
        "I looked at you coming around, and I said, \u201cWintergreen.\u201d",
        "How is it my fault?",
        "But it\u2019s Dwight who\u2019s bring in all the weirdos.",
        "Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input\u2014",
        "I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife\u2014",
        "Oh. Um\u2026",
        "Okay. I can\u2019t say that that\u2019s not fair.",
        "Oh, yeah, so we\u2019ll just do that later.",
        "Uh\u2026  Well, it\u2019s about Athlead. I\u2019m sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?",
        "There\u2019s a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor \u2013",
        "Yes, okay. Bye.",
        "No, thanks.",
        "Dwight, you can\u2019t just hire someone \u2018cause they\u2019re your friend.",
        "Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I\u2019m not looking south, I\u2019m not livin\u2019.  That\u2019s what I always say.",
        "But you know I wouldn\u2019t hire any of these all-stars.",
        "Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?",
        "I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.",
        "Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?",
        "And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.",
        "Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.",
        "Too much now.",
        "That seems inconsiderate.",
        "All right. I think that went well.",
        "So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that\u2019ll print out\u2014Hey. Meet your new desk mate.",
        "Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.",
        "Okay. I\u2019m really sorry I told the guys I\u2019d be there for the board meeting.",
        "I\u2019ll call you when I get there.",
        "All right.",
        "Take care of my wife. I will be back.",
        "No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I\u2019m gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.",
        "Hey.",
        "We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.",
        "And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it\u2019s, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.",
        "I\u2019m couching it!",
        "And this dude labels his food. He\u2019s the clean one. And, I\u2019m the messy one. How much fun is this?",
        "Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.",
        "Who is this guy? We are killing it.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Nice job, man.",
        "What?  Oh, man! I\u2019m sorry about that.",
        "Oh, um\u2026 Are you really mad about this?",
        "Oh. It\u2019s your go-to therm. Oh, man. That\u2019s a bummer. I\u2019m sorry about that.",
        "No, no. If it\u2019s a big deal, it\u2019s a big deal.",
        "No big deal.",
        "Honestly, I don\u2019t mind.  Did you want me to wash it for you or\u2026",
        "OK. Here ya go.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah. Totally.",
        "It\u2019s mine. Don\u2019t worry.",
        "I don\u2019t think you had to.",
        "I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn\u2019t use that?",
        "That\u2019s not the point.",
        "No, I\u2019m not making bread.",
        "Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I\u2019m trying to make.",
        "It\u2019s all good. Are we all good?",
        "What\u2019s that cooler?",
        "Oh, crap. Were those yours?",
        "Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that\u2019s just \u2018Roommates 101\u2019.",
        "Oh. Oh!",
        "You win.  How good did that feel?",
        "It\u2019s like magic. Or, it\u2019s like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.",
        "By the way, they do need an extra day next week.",
        "They are terrible.",
        "Oh my god. That\u2019s so romantic.",
        "Oh my god. That\u2019s less romantic.",
        "Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That\u2019s good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?",
        "I\u2019m very excited to see Brian. Brian\u2019s a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I\u2019m sorry, but you know him. He\u2019s a good guy.",
        "Hey, Brian.",
        "What?",
        "Oh.",
        "Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I\u2019ve wanted the opportunity to say thanks for\u2026 everything. And I\u2019m really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.",
        "Well, I mean, that\u2019s OK. It doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s over. Right? I mean, couples fight.",
        "What?",
        "Crying?",
        "I don\u2019t know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don\u2019t know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.",
        "Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.",
        "No, you\u2019re right. And, and I\u2019m not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don\u2019t have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn\u2019t there. So, let\u2019s just forget about it.",
        "You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.",
        "Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I\u2019m sure you have stuff to do. So we can just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, drop me at the bus station?",
        "I just feel like we\u2019re gonna fight.",
        "So\u2026 how \u2019bout let\u2019s not?",
        "Oh, um.  Happy Valentine\u2019s Day. Sorry, I didn\u2019t have time to wrap it.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "No problem.",
        "You really wanna fight on Valentine\u2019s Day?",
        "OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.",
        "Hey! There she is.  How you doin?",
        "You look great.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ok, I know where you\u2019re going with this, and this is who I am now. I\u2019m a douche. But look what I can do with my hands.",
        "You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.",
        "Call you right back. What were you saying?",
        "I\u2019ve gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You\u2019re gonna crush it, you\u2019re gonna smash it. OK, good luck!",
        "Hey, how\u2019d the interview go?",
        "I can\u2019t wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don\u2019t eat because I\u2019m ordering in.",
        "I\u2019ll make it worth your while, I promise.",
        "Alright, love you.",
        "Hey! Back here.",
        "Si, senor.",
        "Oh man. I\u2019m so sorry. Are you alright?",
        "Are you kidding? We\u2019re in Philly. We\u2019re having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It\u2019s from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.",
        "Alright. So, tell me all about it.",
        "Tell me about the cologne. How much?",
        "You\u2019re definitely hoarding this by the way.",
        "Austin Powers.",
        "Ferris Bueller.",
        "Not Night at the Roxbury.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?",
        "It\u2019s fascinating.",
        "That\u2019s amazing. Well, listen. You can\u2019t win \u2019em all, right?",
        "So, next interview has to be better.",
        "What do you mean? Of course it will. You\u2019re amazing.",
        "Huh. This is a little out of left field.",
        "And I have started a business in Philadelphia.",
        "My condolences.",
        "OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?",
        "I\u2019m sure\u2026 I\u2019m sure she\u2019s in a better place.",
        "OK.  This is crazy. You can\u2019t make a dirt ball.",
        "OK.",
        "Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.",
        "Oh man.",
        "Oh boy, please don\u2019t. Let\u2019s not let that happen.",
        "What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?",

        "Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple\u2019s counseling.",
        "No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we\u2019re just starting couple\u2019s counseling. Uh, which doesn\u2019t sound any better.",
        "That\u2019s all right.",

        "What?",
        "Okay. The annex it is. I\u2019ll be sitting at your desk if that\u2019s okay with you.",
        "Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.",
        "Oh, wow. But, um\u2014Oh, I get that.",

        "Anything would help.",
        "Oh, also, while you\u2019re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.",
        "Wow, that\u2019s\u2014",
        "You come so prepared. Aspirin.",
        "Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It\u2019s really great.",
        "No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t be too sure about that. Just saying.",
        "Wow, hey.",
        "What\u2019s up?",
        "Okay.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, totally you did.",
        "I need you to stay right here while you think about it.",
        "All right? I\u2019m gonna wait.",
        "I\u2019m sure you did not. What was your question?",
        "Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I\u2019m waiting.",
        "Look who\u2019s back.",
        "Weeknights are actually tough just because\u2014",
        "That\u2019s true, yeah.",
        "Congratulations, buddy.",
        "So.",
        "Let\u2019s hear it.",
        "Nope. Can\u2019t accept that job. It\u2019s not a real job.",
        "I\u2019ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I\u2019d be proud to take.",
        "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.",
        "Oh, don\u2019t look at me cause I think you\u2019re making a terrible choice.",
        "You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.",
        "No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What\u2019s up?",
        "What kind of offer?",
        "What?",
        "Oh, my god!",
        "Wow, that is\u2026 wow.",
        "Yeah, we did. Hey, how long\u2014how long do we think that\u2019s gonna take?",
        "Oh, man. Yeah, I can\u2019t do it.",
        "This, man. I can\u2019t do this to Pam.",
        "I know. And I can\u2019t do it.",
        "Sales form for you to sign.",
        "Aw, thanks, man.",
        "No.",
        "Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.",
        "All depends on the conference room meeting itself.  Uh, okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I will. I will.",
        "The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that\u2019s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I\u2019m not risking that again.",
        "He welcomes you.",
        "Your agenda-taking pleases him.",
        "Let\u2019s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you\u2019re expecting a fax today, please don\u2019t yell out, \u201cMichael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.\u201d Ok? That\u2019s nonsense.",
        "Yes, beautiful girl in the front.",
        "That\u2019s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?",
        "Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who\u2019s excited?",
        "I love Star Wars as much as the next guy\u2014",
        "My god, I\u2019m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.",
        "Potential future nonsense.",
        "I\u2019m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You\u2019ve got a regional manager.",
        "Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.",
        "But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah, right. I mean, unless they\u2019re willing to pass some tests.",
        "Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?",
        "Nothing.",
        "Members of the office, hear ye.",
        "Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.",
        "This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that\u2019s for fueling only. No savoring.",
        "He envies you.",
        "Alright.",
        "By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.",
        "A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?",
        "985,000,000,000,017.",
        "Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?",
        "Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.",
        "That\u2019s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?",
        "Ew, the exact opposite, actually.",
        "Come on.",
        "Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna\u2014",
        "Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?",
        "Do you want a corn dog?",
        "We\u2019ll see. You are an assistant who\u2019s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.",
        "Uncanny.",
        "An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?",
        "Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.",
        "Yeah. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll learn. OK, and go ahead.  Oh, god, nice! She\u2019s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!",
        "Look at that form.",
        "Uncanny.",
        "You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing\u2014none of these people are good enough.",
        "What I\u2019m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I\u2019ve ever said.",
        "Is-",
        "The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.",
        "I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one.  That\u2019s it. You look really, really good.",
        "Hey.",
        "You all right? What\u2019s going on?",
        "Yes, I\u2019m happy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "Pam.",
        "This was my decision, not yours.",
        "You didn\u2019t force me.",
        "You did not force me to do this.",
        "I don\u2019t know how else to tell you.",
        "Resent you?",
        "Is that really what you think?",
        "Not enough? I don\u2019t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it\u2019s against the rules but I\u2019m gonna need a favor from you guys.",
        "You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?",
        "Perform a test.",
        "Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I\u2019m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s the best in the biz.",
        "Unless you think he can\u2019t handle it.",
        "All right.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well I\u2019ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn\u2019t believe me, so  I needed a little help.",
        "OK, I don\u2019t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.",
        "I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.",
        "Ok, um, this is\u2026 \u2014I\u2019ll be right back.",
        "What do we got?",
        "Wow! Congratulations, that\u2019s a really big step.",
        "Right in the sweet spot. I think you\u2019re gonna be really happy.",
        "That\u2019s a lot of pros.",
        "So what is the problem?",
        "I don\u2019t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I\u2019ve been faced with a tough decision, there\u2019s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.",
        "Love.",
        "Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who\u2019s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.",
        "Not as good as you.",
        "You got it.",
        "You watched it.",
        "Well, then I guess you\u2019re ready for this.",
        "It\u2019s from the teapot. Everything you\u2019ll ever need to know is in that note.  Not enough for me? You are everything.",
        "Here we go.",
        "Umm\u2026.",
        "I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it\u2019s good for the environment too.",
        "Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.",
        "Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?",
        "And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.",
        "Okay, the limo\u2019s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready \u2018cause I want to pack in a lot.",
        "Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight\u2019s night, okay?",
        "Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He\u2019s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I\u2019ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight\u2026only good surprises. \u201cGuten Pranken\u201d.",
        "Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn\u2019t going to show up?",
        "Mose has been weird? That\u2019s so unlike him.",
        "Hey man, good to see you.",
        "Hey!",
        "Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? \u201cGuten Prank\u201d number one.",
        "And Jim will say nothing.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Wow! That sounds incredible. . Oh, guys. Limo\u2019s here. Let\u2019s do this. Change if you need to.",
        "Get out.",
        "No, Dwight. You\u2019ll be doing the whacking.",
        "Of course I did.",
        "Yeah!  Guten Prank number two.",
        "Private Room.",
        "Enjoy, enjoy.",
        "Okay, man, easy.",
        "Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?",
        "Oh, it\u2019s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela\u2019s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.",
        "They think it was Mose.",
        "Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you\u2019d ever set foot in in this town?",
        "Mm, hey driver. Why don\u2019t you take us to 3030 Adams?",
        "Is that Mose?",
        "Ooh.",
        "Nope, not a prank. I think it\u2019s time for you to bury the hatchet.",
        "Okay, just talk.",
        "I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow\u2019s his wedding day. You can\u2019t be anything but happy on your wedding day.",
        "Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.",
        "Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or\u2026",
        "Right.",
        "Am I the only one that\u2019s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?",
        "Doesn\u2019t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.",
        "She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that\u2019s fine.",
        "O-Kay.",
        "Um, you know what, I actually didn\u2019t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.",
        "You ready?",
        "Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but\u2026 we have a little bit of a problem.",
        "The minister just told me that it\u2019s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.",
        "I haven\u2019t heard of it, obviously. But I\u2019m out because I am significantly younger than you-",
        "I think it\u2019s definitely\u2026 Well, okay. Either way\u2026",
        "Either way, Dwight\u2026 I can\u2019t be there for you. I\u2019m sorry.",
        "I just\u2026really wish there was something I could do.",
        "Best prank ever.",
        "See, now you don\u2019t owe me anything.",
        "I gotta get out of this dress.",
        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "No, really, what\u2019s going on?",
        "Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?",
        "That\u2019s why it\u2019s so clean.",
        "I mean, you were gonna do this without me?",
        "Oh\u2026 okay. Where would we go?",
        "I promise you, you don\u2019t have to do this for me.",
        "The last\u2026",
        "Hold on a second.  The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about\u2026",
        "You wanna do this?",
        "You really want to do this?",
        "Oh my God!",

        "There it is.",

        "Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you.",
        "Aw, thank you. I\u2019ve been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat?",
        "Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson\u2019s snowball company, so you\u2019ll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things.",
        "So listen, why don\u2019t you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you can\u2019t handle the changes.",
        "I would take until the end of the day if I were you.",
        "Oh, that\u2019s Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the \u201cMrs.\u201d just to piss off the new wife. Well, let\u2019s take a gander around this place.",

        "Michael?",
        "I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager.",

        "I\u2019m Jolene Bennett, Jo for short. I\u2019m a breast cancer survivor, close, personal friends with Nancy Pelosi, and Truman Capote and I slept with three of the same guys.

I am CEO of Sabre International, and I sell the best damn printers and all-in-one machines Korea can make. Pleased to meet you.",

I can see it on your faces, I mean, what\u2019s going on now? I mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin? Right? I mean, Sabre? What\u2019s that? Some company I\u2019ve never heard of? Down in Tallahassee? Where is that? Near Mars?",
        "Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm\u2019s reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we\u2019re gonna take that arm, and we\u2019re gonna start selling printers.",

        "Well, I think you\u2019re both being a little too modest.",
        "You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I\u2019m gonna defer to your judgment.",
        "I think you  will become the salesman, and congratulations!  You\u2019re gonna be the new manager of this branch!",
        "You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don\u2019t need so much management?",
        "Fine. I don\u2019t care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it.",
        "Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don\u2019t ride \u2019em. Lotta people try to ride \u2019em.",
        "Oh, I love this, so much fun! There\u2019s such team spirit in this room! \u2018Morning Darling!",
        "Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I\u2019m leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I\u2019m gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they\u2019re onto something.",
        "Oh good morning sweetheart.",
        "I\u2019m sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?",
        "Is that a lump of coal?",
        "Have I been that naughty?",
        "Err, thank you very much. We, we don\u2019t get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I\u2019m used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you\u2019ve ever tasted.",
        "Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay.",
        "Now, after all the talking I\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like.",
        "Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn\u2019t invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist.",
        "You know it doesn\u2019t have to be an invention.",
        "I am so proud of Sabre\u2019s \u201cPrint In All Colors\u201d initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply.   Daryl?",
        "Okay hush now.",
        "But you wouldn\u2019t need more trucks?",
        "Oh look at you.",
        "I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here?",
        "Yeah. Take Jim\u2019s old office.",
        "Yeah, I want to hear more from you.",
        "All right.",
        "Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody\u2019s mind? I\u2019m leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!",
        "Yes, well okay. Florida ain\u2019t that far away.",
        "Well, anytime now.",
        "Oh honey you didn\u2019t buy a ticket?",
        "Oh honey. I\u2019m not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?",
        "Enough!",
        "No, that\u2019s very generous of you, but I\u2019m all set.",
        "Yes it is.",
        "How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?",
        "Oh no no no!  Are you feeling ill?",
        "Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can\u2019t have you getting Callie and Jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with Dwight Howard next week.",
        "Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don\u2019t you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay?",
        "Yes?",
        "Oh! You\u2019re sick!  Dangit! That\u2019s exactly why I sent that receptionist home.",
        "Get everybody sick in the office.",
        "We don\u2019t need any heroes here honey. It\u2019s time for you to get on home now.",
        "You\u2019ll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.",
        "Hey there.",
        "Well there\u2019s chatting time and there\u2019s working time. I\u2019m still on working time.",
        "Well, if you feel like you\u2019ve done a solid days work\u2026",
        "Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you\u2019ve done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home.",
        "Anything else I can help you with?",
        "Oh, you don\u2019t become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off.  You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!",
        "Hello?",
        "Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.",
        "Okay.",
        "Sorry Sugar. What\u2019d you want?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Overnight all my damn bags home. I\u2019m carrying nothing but my Sable gloves.  I\u2019ve had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.",
        "Anything I can do for you Puddin\u2019?",
        "Hmm.",
        "All right then.",
        "Michael?",
        "I look forward to that too.",
        "Howdy. I hope I\u2019m not interrupting anything.",
        "\u2018Course you all, no doubt, know why I\u2019m here.",
        "Turns out our printers are famous. They\u2019re all over the news. It\u2019s an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn\u2019t quite as racy, but uh\u2026 let\u2019s give it a go.",
        "I\u2019m not sure you do, teddy bear.",
        "Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don\u2019t know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving \u2019em free toner, and we keep \u2019em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.",
        "Can you now?",
        "It\u2019s a little form, says \u201cI did not do it.\u201d",
        "All that\u2019s just birthday information, Michael.",
        "Why don\u2019t you come with me? We\u2019ll start out with the honcho, what\u2019cha say?",
        "When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she\u2019d ask one question: What do we do when we find the guilty party? And if they said, \u201cCome down on him with that swift hammer of justice!\u201d, innocent. A clear conscience don\u2019t need no mercy. But if they said \u201cOfficer Bessie, well they may have had a reason, blah blah blah blah\u201d, well nine times out of ten, that\u2019s the anus they\u2019d check.",
        "So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?",
        "Uh, that\u2019s, uh, Guantanamo Bay.",
        "Well, I guess we\u2019re all right, Michael.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay Dwight.",
        "Well, I\u2019m inclined to believe you.",
        "Yeah, I noticed you\u2019ve had a great year. Good boy\u2026 you turning that money into more money?",
        "I don\u2019t like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain\u2019t investing in property, then you\u2019re dumber than a dummy.",
        "Well, buy property. That\u2019s my advice.",
        "Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was.",
        "And we didn\u2019t find anything on your computer.",
        "Except this.",
        "I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I\u2019m just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid?",
        "The way I look at it, there\u2019s only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn\u2019t know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder.",
        "Michael.",
        "Michael Scott\u2026 what do you know?",
        "If it doesn\u2019t matter, then tell me.",
        "Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.",
        "Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who\u2019s giving me the silent treatment\u2026 Speak to me\u2026 speak.  Come with me.",
        "Hahahahahaha.",
        "Michael.",
        "Let\u2019s just talk.",
        "Honey, you don\u2019t seem like your normal self.",
        "Mama Jo knew there was something up.",
        "Oh, I hate that.",
        "Who\u2019s Holly?",
        "When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I\u2019d break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there\u2026 and they\u2019d make a Barbie out of me.",
        "I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.",
        "Oh honey, surely you don\u2019t want that.",
        "Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.",
        "I hope your rough patch ends soon.",
        "Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.",
        "Let me see what I can do.",
        "Why is this my problem, Michael?",
        "Lower yourself, Gabe. I don\u2019t wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won\u2019t fire the boy.",
        "Which are?",
        "Oh, God. How far has it gone?",
        "Well, I got a nephew too. But he don\u2019t work for me. You know why? Cause he\u2019s a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can\u2019t come in my house.",
        "If you keep him, Michael, I\u2019m gonna hold you accountable for him. You\u2019re on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities.",
        "Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys.",

        "But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I\u2019ve always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?",
        "Oh.",
        "Yep.",

        "Six.",
        "So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress!  One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything.  I mean not everything, Jim.  I promise, I\u2019m not that kind of\u2026",

        "You look so pretty.",
        "Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.",

        "Alan\u2019s cartoon is so funny, right?",
        "And they\u2019re, like, so smart. I don\u2019t even know what they mean half the time.",

        "No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.",

        "No, he\u2019s a freak.",
        "Here you go.",
        "It\u2019s not a dress. It\u2019s a kurta.",
        "You look so handsome.",
        "I know.",
        "I\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t get why you won\u2019t go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.",
        "Well, go with Dwight. He\u2019s single, too. Right?",
        "Um\u2026 Diwali is awesome\u2026 and there\u2019s food\u2026 and there\u2019s going to be dancing\u2026 and\u2026 Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um\u2026",

        "Like, an Indian Halloween?",
        "Um, customer service.",
        "What? I\u2019m not Muslim!",
        "She\u2019s so wonderful.",

        "Jim!",
        "Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!",
        "Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!",
        "I just told you.",
        "Looks like salmon.",
        "I eat beef.",
        "Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.",

        "Hello, Ryan.",
        "Oh, thank you. Do you always get presents for your ex-girlfriends?",
        "Well, I didn\u2019t get you anything, because you have treated me inconsiderately, and I\u2019m not gonna stand for that anymore.",
        "Wait, Ryan, you\u2019re not mean. You\u2019re adorable. I\u2019m so sorry. I got you a present, too. But then when I got to work, I didn\u2019t see anything on my desk from you, so I threw it away. And then Asuncion took the trash out, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s in the dumpster. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m the worst.",
        "No, you paid money for that CD.",

        "Sometimes.",
        "Don\u2019t dump me while I\u2019m in the dumpster. Just go back inside if you\u2019re so cold. I\u2019ll just stay in the dumpster.",

        "And what are these? Are\u2026 Why are there egg yolks in here? Aren\u2019t you supposed to eat the yolks?",

        "Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.",

        "So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let\u2019s just say that I just sent back <i>Love Actually</i>, which was awesome.   And they sent me <i>Uptown Girls</i>, which is also awesome.  But guess what, now I want to see love actually again,  but it\u2019s at the bottom of the que!  Oh no, what do I do!?  What I do, is this.  I go online, I go click, click, click.  And I change the order of the que, so that I can see <i>Love Actually</i>  as soon as I want to.  It\u2019s so easy, Ryan.  Do you really not know how Netflix works?",

All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say \u201cCustomer Service, this is Kelly!\u201d  Except don\u2019t say \u201cKelly,\u201d say your own name.  Or if you\u2019re bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones,  and I talked like this for the whole conversation!",

        "The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you\u2019re sorry. Do that and you\u2019ll be fine. Make sense?",

        "Was he still there?",
        "I\u2019m so cold, I\u2019m gonna faint.  If I faint, it\u2019s totally your fault, Jim.",
        "Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good\u2026",
        "Why would he say that?",
        "Oh, yeah, and then, yell at Creed, because you know what?  Looking can be as bad as touching.",
        "Ignore her, those glasses are so cool.",

I\u2019m gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, \u201cHi Ryan.\u201d And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, \u201cDamn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison.\u201d",
        "Can I be your bridesmaid?",
        "Just leave me alone!",
        "I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So \u2026 gonna look amazing.",
        "I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.",
        "It\u2019s just some of us are taking this really seriously.",
        "I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It\u2019s going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don\u2019t get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It\u2019s from Mexico.",
        "Oh, hello Ryan.  You look well.",
        "Cool.",
        "Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I\u2019m dating Darryl, still, and we\u2019re like crazy in love so\u2026",

        "I never know when you\u2019re kidding.",
        "What?",
        "Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I\u2019ll just take up smoking.  I\u2019ll do it.  I don\u2019t care.",
        "Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.",
        "And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.",

        "What are you talking about?",
        "You always say that, and I almost never know.",
        "Are you accusing me of something?",
        "You just can\u2019t come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn\u2019t give you such bad customer reviews.",
        "Dwight, get out of my nook!",
        "Yeah, he\u2019s weird.",
        "OK.",

        "I was raped.",
        "OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn\u2019t come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn\u2019t even show up, and so you\u2019re bad friends.",
        "See? I wasn\u2019t lying.",
        "I was lying.",
        "No problem.",
        "For you.  I\u2019m with Darryl.",
        "Is that supposed to impress me?",
        "No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I\u2019m not gonna flaunt it and I\u2019m not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.",
        "What are we doing?  This is so wrong.",
        "Mmmm\u2026. mmm. This can\u2019t happen again.",

        "Mmhmm.",
        "Punch him, Toby!",
        "Hi, Michael.",
        "Can\u2019t do what?",
        "Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.",

        "Okay?",
        "Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.",
        "Yeah, \u2019cause this is kind of a drag.",
        "I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.",
        "There\u2019s Andy, he\u2019s in his car. You guys, what is he doing?",
        "Yeah, shut up Kevin.",
        "No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn\u2019t hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank!",
        "Dwight!",
        "A vacation.",
        "I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.",
        "Screw you.",
        "Oh yeah? Screw you too.",
        "My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn\u2019t even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.",
        "Screw you guys. You\u2019re dead to me.",
        "Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don\u2019t forget your birthday, I would never do that.",
        "I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.",
        "In a way, it\u2019s good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.",
        "Ice Cream.",
        "Stop yelling at me!",
        "I didn\u2019t do anything!",
        "I was kickin\u2019 it.",
        "My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father\u2019s. And I just thought it\u2019d be really romantic, like \u2018Thelma and Louise,\u2019 but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can\u2019t believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!",
        "You did? I wanna see the cake.",
        "I hate it.",
        "Well, there\u2019s no flowers\u2026 or toys\u2026 or\u2014 I mean, there\u2019s nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn\u2019t have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!",

        "Yeah, thanks.",
        "Well, his heart was in the right place.",
        "You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.",
        "Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it\u2019s like a fairy tale.",

        "Aww.",
        "Michael, it\u2019s time.",
        "Michael get to the good part.",
        "So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it\u2019s to pick up my little sisters from school.  We\u2019re really tight. We\u2019re like the Kardashians..",

        "Is Ryan going?",
        "Here\u2019s the deal.  I really want to go but I\u2019m not gonna go if Ryan doesn\u2019t go, because it\u2019s kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I\u2019d really like to be there to support Jim.",
        "I love rivalries\u2013 Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It\u2019s so much fun. But I guess if I\u2019m really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I\u2019d have to go with L.C.  Heidi\u2019s a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.",

        "Oh my God.",
        "I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you\u2019re supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.",
        "You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you\u2019re everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.",

        "What drama?",
        "So unnecessary.",
        "I mean, if the salesmen weren\u2019t acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn\u2019t be so bad \u2013 did you ever think of that?",

        "And what was with Jesse\u2019s sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it\u2019s just. It\u2019s irresponsible.",

        "Oh my God what song was that?",
        "What song was it?",
        "Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim?  \u2018Cause we missed it!",

        "Don\u2019t do it Kevin, that\u2019s the fake kind of apology.",
        "This is textbook. It\u2019s so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it\u2019s some offense to have feelings. Don\u2019t do it Kevin.",
        "Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You\u2019re blocking my table with your giant body.",

        "What?",
        "Why should I pretend that you are my boss?",
        "Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.",
        "You really would?",
        "Sure thing, Mr. Howard.",
        "Mom, Ryan\u2019s taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he\u2019s not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won\u2019t ever stand us up again.",

        "All the time.",
        "Lame?  You worked at Anthropology?",

        "You chose this job over that job?",
        "I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can\u2019t do this.  I can\u2019t do this.  I\u2019m sorry.  I just can\u2019t do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn\u2019t had a real job here in years.",
        "No, he\u2019s just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He\u2019s like Rango.  He doesn\u2019t work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn\u2019t save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.",
        "He\u2019s not saying anything!",
        "That\u2019s not fair, I mean, I\u2019ve been working here for such a long ti\u2013",
        "Oh my God, what is wrong with you?",
        "It\u2019s none of your business, actually. It\u2019s very medical and personal.",
        "Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.",
        "Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.",
        "Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?",
        "Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?",
        "Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.",
        "Well, I manage my department, and I\u2019ve been doing that for several years now. And, god, I\u2019ve learned a lot of life lessons along the way.",
        "Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.",
        "What was that?",
        "Am I not a serious candidate?",
        "I don\u2019t have any, assh***.",
        "Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?",
        "Uh,\u2026 can it be in private?  Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not about you.  As Minority Executive, I think it\u2019s my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.",
        "Very, very interesting. And you know what? I\u2019m impressed.",
        "I don\u2019t know, Jim, \u2019cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.",
        "Yeah, it was a great deal.",
        "I don\u2019t know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?",
        "That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I\u2019m a singer, I\u2019m a fashion designer.",
        "You are not leaving without giving me a hug.  Ughh.",
        "I\u2019m sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!",
        "I don\u2019t care. They can just vote.",
        "Very smart.",
        "I can\u2019t get down.",
        "How is this a pizza party?",
        "Yeah, well, that\u2019s just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.",
        "Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?",
        "Everybody hates those endings!",
        "Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It\u2019s so gross.",
        "This point system is really insulting.",
        "That\u2019s a tablecloth.",
        "No! I mean, let him, he should just explore other options\u2026",
        "Bowties, no offense, are a black thing. They\u2019re for rappers and NBA players. I cringe when I see Tucker Carlson trying to pull off a bowtie. It\u2019s like yeah Tucker, you\u2019re so street.",
        "So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?",
        "Oh don\u2019t try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.",
        "That\u2019ll work.",
        "Bye.",
        "Oh, god.",
        "I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year\u2026.I mean obviously I wouldn\u2019t come in till noon and I wouldn\u2019t do anything I didn\u2019t wanna do. I mean I\u2019m getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.",
        "I don\u2019t get the reason for this party.",
        "What\u2019s the reason, Andy? What\u2019s the reason?",
        "I am so cold.",
        "This is ridiculous! Why can\u2019t there just be two Kate Middleton\u2019s?",
        "Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn\u2019t even here.",
        "Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?",
        "What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?",
        "Well, Toby and I did, yeah.",
        "1, 2, 3!",
        "Thank you.",
        "Fine.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "I guess.",
        "I try not to think about it.",
        "Never marrying.",
        "What emails are you talking about?",
        "That\u2019s not that bad actually.",
        "Um, no we\u2019re not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.",
        "Wha\u00e2\u20ac what\u2019s Dwight\u2019s mothers name.",
        "Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!!  Shut it down! Shut it down!",
        "Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don\u2019t want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.",
        "It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy\u2019s hot.",
        "Eww!",
        "I mean, I guess he\u2019d be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he\u2019ll get hair plugs.",
        "Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It\u2019s called being a nice person.",
        "I\u2019m gonna write something mean on his wall.",
        "Oh my God, kill me!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Pitiful.",
        "Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.",
        "Isn\u2019t Gettysburg like three hours away?",
        "I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.",
        "I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.",
        "It\u2019s really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.",
        "Eww, what is that?",
        "Cool.",
        "Do you think that\u2019s what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?",
        "Well help me, OK? Just, uh take\u2026",
        "Yo.",
        "On it.",
        "Jessica, did you just fart?",
        "And that, is how it\u2019s done.",
        "No, it\u2019s Lamar Odom. If it\u2019d been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he\u2019s at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.",
        "What!",
        "Cause it\u2019s like, really\u2026",
        "Having fun.",
        "Tu Bishvat!",
        "Hey, is it true that you\u2019re not allowed to spend time with your girlfriend during the month of Tu Bishvat?",
        "I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Ryan lies to me and says he has a whole Jewish holiday for an entire month\u2026..",
        "Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?",
        "I don\u2019t know. It looks pretty great to me.",
        "Yeah, thanks. I\u2019m really glad I found it.",
        "Shh. Of course I\u2019m superstitious. What are you talking about?",
        "Oh God.",
        "You\u2019ve broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it.",
        "Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?",
        "So then this means nothing to you.",
        "Damn girl! Your body!",
        "You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.",
        "Why?",
        "Hell yeah.",
        "Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.",
        "For you maybe.",
        "I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to live here without you.",
        "Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.",
        "We\u2019re screwed.",
        "Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it\u2019s for me.  Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!",
        "Andy, pick up the phone!",
        "I\u2019m dying!",
        "Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.",
        "Guys, we\u2019re not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.",
        "I thin we\u2019re gonna need to here those texts.",
        "No. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.",
        "Boring.",
        "Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, \u2019cause three dots means \u2018to be continued\u2019, four dots is a typo, but five dots means \u201cWhoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.",
        "Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.",
        "Oh, my god!",
        "Will someone please explain what\u2019s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it\u2019s like my life is buffering.",
        "So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar \u2014 \u201cHow to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.\u201d",
        "No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.",
        "I was a twelve year old bully.",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.",
        "Good. Let\u2019s go.",
        "You think you\u2019re so pretty! Well you\u2019re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!",
        "Take that! Not so pre-violent anymore!",
        "Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.",
        "Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?",
        "Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn\u2019t lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.",
        "Oh, great.",
        "It\u2019s no bother, you guys are our friends.",
        "Why?",
        "Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.",
        "God I don\u2019t even remember what that fight was about.",
        "He\u2019s so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, \u201cKelly, that will be the color of our children.\u201d",
        "Which time?",
        "Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.",
        "I wasn\u2019t going to interrupt.",
        "Ryan.",
        "You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.",
        "I do.",
        "I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?",
        "That was really cool.",
        "Just keep chatting. I\u2019m just checking my makeup in your webcam.",
        "Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.",
        "I\u2019m throwing out all my mirrors.",
        "Now you look at me like you\u2019re adoring me, I\u2019m gonna look at the camera like I don\u2019t even know you\u2019re there.",
        "I don't need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.",
        "Enjoy the snow losers.",
        "Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.",
        "Hey, Ryan!",
        "Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?",
        "Drake is your baby\u2019s name?",
        "That is an amazing name. I\u2019m obsessed with Drake. His last album\u2026 it just touched me to pieces.",

I\u2019m serious about this stuff.  I\u2019m up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It\u2019s a recipe passed down from Malone\u2019s for generations.  It\u2019s probably the thing I do best.",

        "Dude, what if, since you\u2019re feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool?",
        "Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.",
        "Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?",
        "It was me.",
        "Whoa.",
        "I\u2019m right here!  Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.",
        "Okay. Watch my toes.",
        "That\u2019s racist! I don\u2019t know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.",
        "Wow!",
        "Kelly, that is mine! This is mine!",
        "No!",
        "Is it black? \u2018Cause that would be hilarious.",
        "You know.",
        "A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.",
        "Oh, did I win the pool?",
        "Yeah, Oscar\u2019s the dad, I\u2019m Oscar\u2019s dad and Angela\u2019s my mom.",
        "Got that, bimbo?",
        "Hi!",
        "Phillip is so fat.",
        "You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn\u2019t prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.",
        "I\u2019m going to call him Little Kevin.",
        "I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.",
        "Little Kevin.",
        "Extremely, but I\u2019m gonna fight through it.",
        "Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman\u2019s gotta take off his cape.",
        "Hey!",
        "Because I feel like that I\u2019m in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there\u2019s like a crazy mismatch or something\u2026",
        "When do we leave?",
        "Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge?  Hey guys, look at me, I\u2019m huge.",
        "Are those the lyrics?",
        "One order.",
        "Dude, you didn\u2019t tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!",
        "One order.",
        "It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery\u00e2\u20ac",
        "Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?",
        "Listen, it\u2019s important. You\u2019ve gotta hear this.",
        "I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?",
        "It\u2019s not a kid on a bike. It\u2019s a man in a car.",
        "Yeah",
        "Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?",
        "Bye.",
        "Whether it\u2019s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.",
        "Cookies, eh?",
        "Oh, the springtime thinks that it\u2019s the best. And fall time thinks that it\u2019s the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine\u2019s thinks that it\u2019s the best. But gather round, peeps, I\u2019ll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that\u2019s the truth.",
        "I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.",
        "I do.",
        "Oh, I definitely do.",
        "Hey guys, come on. Don\u2019t fight over me.",
        "No. Wait, no. I\u2019m buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and\u2026 69ed.",
        "Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts\u2026 no offence Oscar.",
        "That\u2019s true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby\u2019s probably in bed with some model.",
        "This is tough. \u2018Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I\u2019ve reached my decision. I have decided\u2026 that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.",
        "No, it\u2019s not worth it? That\u2019s too bad. \u2018Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.",
        "Hungrier.",
        "Hungrier.",
        "Oh yeah, I\u2019m talking triple digits.  Again.",
        "Go.",
        "Perfect! Now people will think I\u2019m doing hot girls all day.",
        "Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I\u2019ll do anything.  I\u2019m even gonna kiss Meredith.  That is\u2026 hmph\u2026 that\u2019s ah\u2026 so good.",
        "Nice.",
        "When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.",
        "I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, \u201cLook, a balloon.\u201d",
        "oooh",
        "Huh. Yeah, that\u2019s weird. He\u2019s usually here by now. Right guys?",
        "Hot tub party?",
        "I do.  Come on everyone\u2026",
        "Come on Jim, you\u2019re killing her!",
        "None taken.",
        "Shh, here she comes!",
        "You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?",
        "Welcome home.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She\u2019s sweet. I just wish there was pockets.",
        "Get lower.",
        "Dwight couldn\u2019t get it up for Nellie?",
        "Tip-top shape.",
        "Ooh, ooh!",
        "Yeah. Man, you\u2019re insane right now. Ravi\u2019s the whole package.",
        "Yeah, man, he\u2019s absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.",
        "because he fired you which means apparently you\u2019re living in your car now.",
        "Wait, what? You\u2019re going to the fundraiser tonight? That\u2019s going to be weird.",
        "It\u2019s going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.",
        "Hey, I hear you! I hope you\u2019re right. It just seems like it\u2019s going to be really, really weird.",
        "Oh man, this is weird!",
        "Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one\u2019s raping this guy!",
        "No! It was my idea to not be raped!",
        "Whoa, Dwight, I don\u2019t think you understand.",
        "So Dwight doesn\u2019t understand silent auctions. I guess he\u2019s the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn\u2019t have one!",
        "I\u2019m sorry, are you guys nuts? He\u2019s not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.",
        "No. No he\u2019s not.",
        "You\u2019re welcome!",
        "Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!",
        "My dog Ruby doesn\u2019t do anything, she just lays there all day! She\u2019s so chill.",
        "Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She\u2019s so dainty!",
        "Doesn\u2019t really poop. It\u2019s perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.",
        "She smells horrible. It\u2019s unbelievable. But I don\u2019t want to put her in the bath, because I\u2019m afraid that she\u2019ll drown.",
        "People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they\u2019re just jealous, right!  Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!",
        "The branch closed. Forever.",
        "Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you.  Ooh!",
        "Wait, C-R-A-Z\u2026",
        "Even I know that\u2019s weird.",
        "Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I'm not that good at puzzles.",
        "So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn't get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.",
        "The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?",
        "Angela's cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can't eat cats. You can't eat cats, Kevin.",
        "I'll take him.",
        "I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!",
        "Go ahead",
        "Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?",
        "A wheel is supposed to spin.",
        "Okay, that's what I'm talking about! Big money, big money!  Mug duty?",
        "This sucks.",
        "Yeah, I don't think that you understand wheels.",
        "Oh boy! What\u2019s happening?",
        "Heifer\u2019s International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It\u2019s a great prank.",
        "What\u2019s the craziest place you\u2019ve ever made whoopie?",
        "Totally. George Clooney.",
        "What is the craziest place you\u2019ve ever made whoopie?",
        "And John Wayne?",
        "Wayne Johnson? The Rock?",
        "Yeah, that\u2014you\u2019re being really mean, Andy.",
        "That\u2019s me. <i>",
        "As would I.",
        "My name is Kevin.",
        "That is my name.",
        "They call me Kevin.",
        "Cause that\u2019s my name.",
        "Next stop pies!",
        "At five? That\u2019s only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.",
        "Wh\u2026",
        "314 pies.",
        "Well, it\u2019s the\u2026carry the four\u2026and\u2026it doesn\u2019t work.",
        "Well now I don\u2019t even feel like pie. Wait\u2026no it\u2019s back.",
        "Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we\u2019re just gonna barely make it.",
        "I insult you, Oscar.",
        "I insult you! To your face!",
        "Then why don\u2019t you do something about it?",
        "You don\u2019t have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face!  Yes!",
        "Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.",
        "It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMonster Mash.' I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!",
        "That\u2019s beautiful. No, I totally get that.",
        "I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.",
        "What happened?",
        "Yeah, I think this day could get worse.",
        "I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.",
        "I\u2026 did not.",
        "Oh really, Angela? That\u2019s interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh!  I have to go to the bathroom!",
        "I have to go to the bathroom!",
        "I have to go to the bathroom!",
        "",
        "Please, stop.",
        "Please, stop.",
        "I can\u2019t, it\u2019s too much!",
        "Yeah, Oscar\u2019s in big trouble.",
        "Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I\u2019m getting a promotion?",
        "Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn\u2019t screw up your secret with Angela. I\u2019ve been really worried about that.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oscar, we\u2019re in the middle of talking.",
        "Oh that is nice. Classy move.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.",
        "You know what Angela? I- Oh my god.",
        "Come on Oscar, we\u2019re not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support.",
        "It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!",
        "I totally forgot about the affair for a minute.  Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn\u2019t even know.  Her life is a complete sham!",
        "Nice!",
        "That\u2019s the winter season., three months.",
        "What\u2019s happening in three months?",
        "Make it go taller.",
        "No, not taller this way, taller this way.",
        "You\u2019re not getting this, Peter. Make it go wider\u2026 up!",
        "Me and Pete are building a tower.",
        "Obviously. He\u2019s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he\u2019s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.",
        "Huh?",
        "Yep, yep, yep.",
        "Okay, I got this one.",
        "No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Nice. Pretty soon, we\u2019re gonna be at the ceiling.",
        "I am Oscar Martinez.",
        "Wha\u2013 wh\u2013",
        "Nice! Yeah.",
        "Nice. Nice.",
        "You did it.",
        "So we\u2019re not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?",
        "Well, you are the one in charge of it.",
        "Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?",
        "No.",
        "Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.",
        "\u201cnow, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.\u201d",
        "Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he\u2019s like, \u201cYippie-Ki-Yay, mother\u2013\u201d",
        "Yes, you are right. Forgive me.",
        "Nope.",

        "No.",
        "Here man.  You need that more than me.",
        "Yeah",
        "I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.",
        "An Escalade.",
        "Big mistake.",
        "So does this mean you\u2019re gonna take Darryl back?",
        "Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? \u2018Cause I\u2019m free, literally forever.",
        "No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.",
        "I wonder what happened over there. I\u2019ve been sitting here the whole time.",
        "Hey, so how was it? I mean\u2026 the sex with Jan.",
        "Taste test? I\u2019m in!",
        "Yeah, we\u2019re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.",
        "Alright everybody, who\u2019s in?  Angela?  Don\u2019t make us come over there.",
        "Alright, let\u2019s go.",
        "No way.",

        "Pam, look out!",
        "It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.",
        "So long, noise!",
        "Well I can\u2019t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.",
        "Yeah!",

        "A lightbul\u2013",
        "Whoa.",
        "Whoa.",
        "That\u2019s a flush.",
        "Ooh, I haven\u2019t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?",
        "Ooh, it\u2019s when you get a free sandwich after you\u2019ve already eaten ten sandwiches.",
        "Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that\u2019s the guy that Erin\u2019s flirting with?",
        "Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart\u2026 and a little bit your penis.",
        "Let\u2019s get this over with, Pam.",
        "Meredith, I tell you all the time.",
        "Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping\u2026  8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation\u2026",
        "Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can\u2019t come to your son\u2019s birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?",
        "OK. I understand. I\u2019ll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.",
        "Opening with pub pastries? That\u2019s a bold play. They\u2019re saying, it\u2019s only gonna get better from here? Good luck.",
        "Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.",
        "You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you\u2019re just using them. Again, the food was very good.",
        "Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I\u2019ve been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It\u2019s been yummy. But now, Andy\u2019s coming back. So, I guess it\u2019s goodbye chunky, lemon milk.",
        "OK, I\u2019ll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.",
        "Ew! I\u2019ll be your foot buddy.",
        "He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?",
        "You know Pam\u2019s mural? Well, Frank\u2026",
        "Whoa.",
        "Pete\u2026",
        "Pete what?",
        "I\u2019m Kevin.",
        "Didn\u2019t you two used to do it?",
        "Oh, why don\u2019t your famous stomachs help you now?",
        "Yep. Acidic, all right.",
        "Packer, we accept.",
        "They do. It\u2019s awful. And, it\u2019s getting worse every day.",
        "You don\u2019t know that.",
        "James Bond was a spy.",
        "Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.",
        "Oh, that was fantastic.",
        "Why would you ask me?",
        "My night was just like that.  Meaning normal.",
        "Nope. I did not see you either.",
        "Ah.",
        "Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.",
        "Uh oh. She\u2019s doing it again.",
        "What\u2019s going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?",
        "Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.",
        "This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.",
        "Did you see this?",
        "Andy, are there documentary groupies?",
        "Of course.",
        "What was that word they said when they showed me \u201cSkrald mand\u201d? What\u2019s that mean in Danish? Cool guy?",
        "Cool. Superhero.",
        "Ooh, there\u2019s Angela! I work with her!",
        "Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t know, and you didn\u2019t freaking know. But I knew!",
        "Yes, we did it!",
        "Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.",
        "Ohh.",
        "Yes!",
        "Uh huh.",
        "Of course.",
        "Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.",
        "No.",
        "This is flatter.",
        "I can\u2019t. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.",
        "Fine.",
        "I\u2019m not giving up.  I\u2019m going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.",

        "Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee!  Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It\u2019s a guy thing, Pam. I\u2019m sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go.  I\u2019m Hitler. Adolf Hitler.",
        "Relax. Everything\u2019s under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That\u2019s important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it.",
        "Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don\u2019t you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.",
        "I\u2019m sorry?",
        "If you\u2019re unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.",
        "I think I\u2019m a role model here. I think I garner people\u2019s respect.  Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.",
        "People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope\u2026 Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it\u2019s really beyond words. It\u2019s really incalculable.",
        "Now I know there\u2019s some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.",
        "Assistant to the Regional Manager.",
        "I\u2019m about to tell everybody. I\u2019m just about to tell everybody.",
        "You don\u2019t know what it is.",
        "I don\u2019t need your permission.",
        "Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.",
        "Not gonna happen.",
        "It won\u2019t be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.",
        "No.",
        "Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I\u2019m a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.",
        "I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.",
        "Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.",
        "No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they\u2019re gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh\u2019s people, but I\u2019m the head of this family, and you ain\u2019t gonna be messing with my chillin.",
        "Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.",
        "Introduce yourself. Be polite.",
        "Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.",
        "That\u2019s his profit.",
        "OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?",
        "What is that?",
        "No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.",
        "Discipline. Kinky!  All right, here\u2019s the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.",
        "And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight\u2019s personal effects into Jell-O.",
        "Nice. That\u2019s the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.",
        "Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.",
        "Pudding. Pudding\u2026 I\u2019m trying to think of another dessert to do.",
        "So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I\u2019ve created here is that I\u2019m a friend first, and a boss second\u2026 and probably an entertainer third.  Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk\u2019d and all that kind of stuff?",
        "You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?",
        "Just follow my lead. Don\u2019t pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don\u2019t want to\u2026",
        "Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.",
        "Why? Well, theft and stealing.",
        "Post-it Notes.",
        "50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you\u2019ve made a profit\u2026 margin. You\u2019re gonna run us out of business, Pam.",
        "Yeah. I am.",
        "But the best thing about it is that we\u2019re not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and\u2026 Just clean out your desk. I\u2019m sorry.",
        "You been X\u2019d punk!  Surprise! It\u2019s a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you\u2026 God, we totally got you.",
        "I don\u2019t know about that.",
        "What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It\u2019s the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, \u201cMr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?\u201d Wow. Wow. Didn\u2019t work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.",
        "Yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on Pam.",
        "Messages?  </p>",
        "Curly? Very good. Curly Joe DeRita.",
        "Well, comedy\u2019s kinda my thing. Watch this, here\u2019s Curly Joe. Mmm. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Oh, I forgot. Here we go.  I\u2019m Hitler. Right.  Me, me, me, me, me, me. Curly Joe Hitler.   </p>",
        "Oh, John Belushi. What a crazy guy. Phew, freaked myself out this morning.",
        "Yeah. I thought I found a lump. I checked the, uh\u2026 I check the jewels every month. This time\u2026 You know, it\u2019s a little different. It was fine. It was fine. But freaky, man, you know. Testicular cancer, God. Cancer, whoa testicles. So\u2026 What\u2019s, um\u2026 What you eating?",
        "Oh, place around the corner. Nice. All right. See you later.  </p>",
        "Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?",

It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been pushing, that I\u2019ve been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it\u2019s very important that we have this. I\u2019m very, very excited.",
        "Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?",
        "Did you have a good weekend going there?",
        "Oh yeah, I bet it was fun.  Oh, hey! This is Oscar\u2014",

        "Yes.",
        "OK.",
        "Hey, hey why don\u2019t you run it by me and I\u2019ll run it by him.",

        "Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.",
        "How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I\u2019m white and Chris is black?",

        "Sure.",
        "Here\u2019s the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of\u2026 racial awareness and it\u2019s probably more advanced than you\u2019re used to. That\u2019s probably throwing you off a little bit.",
        "OK, well I know. You told me that several times.",

        "Pam, Michael Scott. How\u2019s tricks?",
        "Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I\u2019m busy, busy, busy. Can\u2019t step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody\u2019s doing. Everybody cool out there?",

        "I have to make a call after I finish\u2026 my work. You know what? Uh, just don\u2019t let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I\u2019m just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?",
        "Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.",
        "Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?",
        "Ah, what? Which memo?",
        "Is it a good plan?",
        "Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?",
        "No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don\u2019t you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",
        "OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there\u2019s some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?",
        "Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn\u2019t matter. The point is, they\u2019re not unhappy anymore. They\u2019re out there thinking, \u201cWow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He\u2019s cool. I\u2026 what a great guy. I love him. I\u2026 <i>love</i> him.",

        "Oh, Christ.",
        "Well, what? You could be referring to anything.",
        "Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?",
        "Oh come on! That\u2019s horrible! Aaah\u2026 Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and\u2026 what time is it, what time is it?  Ah, it\u2019s after five. Oh, oh it\u2019s awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.",

        "Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.",
        "It looks like there\u2019s gonna be downsizing. And it\u2019s part of my job, but\u2026 blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re foir-ed. Uh, you\u2019re foir-ed.\u201d It just makes people sad, and an office can\u2019t function that way. No way.  \u201cYou\u2019re foir-ed.\u201d  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, \u201cYou\u2019re hired, and you can work here as long as you want.\u201d But that\u2019s unrealistic, so\u2026",

Just fudge the numbers.\u201d Not bad, pretty funny, I don\u2019t appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here\u2019s the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I\u2019ve already set the bar really high. And they\u2019re all worried about their jobs, you know. It\u2019s kinda dark out there.

        "I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.",
        "Good. Excellent, it\u2019ll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we\u2019re going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody\u2019s gonna want to do it and I know everybody\u2019s gonna complain and bitch and I don\u2019t want to have to deal with that.",
        "Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.",
        "No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s lower, so\u2026",
        "All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don\u2019t you call it that, I\u2019ve earned the right.",
        "And here we have \u201cMister Roger\u2019s Neighborhood.\u201d Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He\u2019s temping upstairs.",
        "And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.",
        "No, it\u2019s Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.",
        "And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.",
        "You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it\u2019s part of the job!  Rapport!",
        "So, um, one o\u2019clock sharp and we\u2019ve got a game on.",
        "Oh, I see, you\u2019re chickening out on me. You\u2019re bailing on me.",
        "Oh, well, I\u2019m glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I\u2019m down here it doesn\u2019t seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can\u2019t take it. OK, fine, have it your way.",
        "All right, see you at one.",
        "Are we ready for the game?",
        "I\u2026 yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.",
        "Nerd. That is why you\u2019re not on the team.",
        "Uh,  \u201cI\u2019ll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.\u201d",
        "OK, so, let\u2019s put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.",
        "Um, what do you play? Center?",
        "Uh\u2026",
        "Uh, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember saying that.",
        "Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um\u2026 other starters\u2026 Me, of course. I heard it that time.",
        "] Um\u2026 Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?",
        "I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.",
        "No.",
        "No, no, ridiculous.",
        "Close. All right, uh\u2026 Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.",
        "Sorry Phyllis.",
        "No, I\u2019m team captain.",
        "No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.",
        "No.",
        "Jim, you\u2019re in charge of the vacation schedule now.",
        "Threat neutralized.",
        "Off the backboard!",
        "Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?",
        "Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.",
        "Oh, yeah right.",
        "Oh, yuck, that\u2019s worse than you playing. \u2026 \u2018Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That\u2019s where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you\u2019re on the team! All right, cool! Very good.",
        "Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?",
        "Oh ho, oh, he\u2019s running. He\u2019s running. He\u2019s running, but he can\u2019t hide because you know what? One o\u2019clock, you better bring your \u2018A\u2019 game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!",
        "Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I\u2019m gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.",
        "What?",
        "OK. Cool, you\u2019re on.  Don\u2019t screw this up.",
        "Classic beginner\u2019s mistake, eating before a game.",
        "Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let\u2019s bring it in! Here we go!  OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you\u2019re fired. That\u2019s a joke.  OK, let\u2019s do it.",
        "All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?",
        "OK.",
        "OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.",
        "Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got\u2026 Um\u2026OK, all right, you guys.",
        "Aw, come on Dwight.",
        "On. Just put it on.",

        "OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That\u2019s a foul.",
        "OK, I\u2019ll take it.  OK.",
        "When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It\u2019s gone, I\u2019m in the zone.",
        "What is wrong with me today?!",
        "Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don\u2019t know\u2026 I might just be a basketball machine. What\u2019s Dunder Mifflin? I\u2019ve never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um\u2026 well, that\u2019s probably gonna happen, actually.",
        "Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut!  Whoa!",
        "That is cool. Is that like the Robot?",
        "Nice! Come here!",

        "Foul! Foul!",
        "Oh, that hurts.",
        "What\u2019s your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?",
        "No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.",
        "Yes, it was. You know what, I\u2019m just being fair.",
        "Game over. Game over. That is it! I\u2019m sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that\u2019s just\u2026 we\u2019re having a friendly game. It\u2019s a shame. This is a damn shame, but we\u2019re like a family here and that just, that won\u2019t fly.",
        "Thanks Dwight.",
        "Well, let\u2019s just say whoever was ahead won.",
        "It was us? Really? I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.",

        "Hey, hey\u2026",
        "You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would\u2019ve been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I\u2019m embarrassed it was even that close though. So\u2026 nah, of course, we\u2019re coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.",
        "Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.",
        "Come on. Let\u2019s not be gloomy here man. We\u2019re all in this together. We\u2019re a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody\u2019s coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.",
        "The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don\u2019t win. But we did because we were ahead.",
        "Uh, yes. Thank you for noticing.",
        "Uh, they look that good? Wow.  Oh, Pam please behave. Mike Myers, genius. Um, no actually I got them at a fancier place. Target.",

        "Yes, yes. Assistant to  the regional manager.",
        "No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s lower.",
        "What was that?",
        "That look?",
        "Like trying to find the camera, to give the camera a look. Okay, we\u2019re done. Is that your stomach? I keep hearing somebody\u2019s stomach.  God.",
        "Oww whoo whoo! The Answer was on fire!",
        "Oh, man! Man I tell ya. Iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches.",
        "No, neither am I. We both look good.",
        "Do I have a nickname on the court, um? Well, The Answer would be nice, but it\u2019s taken. So, uh, probably The Question. The Answer dishes to The Question. The Question back to The Answer. Answer over to The Question. The Answer, whew,  three points. The Question, whew, whew,  six points. Nothing but net. Question, who\u2019s the best player in the league? Answer, The Question.

        "It\u2019s not a Jewish joke, so don\u2019t worry.",
        "No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One \u2018o clock. Big game, big game.",
        "Mmm. No, you said you could man. We\u2019re counting on ya. You know you\u2019re playing point guard.",

        "Birdie. He\u2019s not the guy with the cheeks. Kenny G. Is\u2026 if you knew jazz, you\u2019d know who I mean. Kenny G. God. Glad I remembered that. Jazz people know who he is.",
        "Stanley, gotta play hurt.",
        "I just want you know, you\u2019ve been a big disappointment to me today, okay.",
        "I\u2019m in. I\u2019m in. Here we go.  Zone, Phyllis! We\u2019re playing zone!",

        "Okay",
        "Uh, huh.",
        "Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That\u2019s cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?",
        "Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that\u2019ve been promoted to\u2026",
        "I didn\u2019t mean me!",
        "Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.",
        "It\u2019s illegal. Can\u2019t do that.  Next best thing.",
        "Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That\u2019s just stupid.",
        "Pam!",
        "Burger with cheese!",
        "And fries!",
        "And shake! What? Go ahead.",
        "No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.",
        "Pam. Pam. Come on, I\u2019m busy. So just tell her to go away.",
        "Oooh, alright I\u2019ll talk to her.",
        "All right girls break it up, you\u2019re being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.",
        "Don\u2019t say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?",

        "Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I\u2019m  against violence in the workplace.",
        "Nobody cares what you think.",
        "So uh, you know what? I usually don\u2019t allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It\u2019s yours. All day.",
        "Well, lets put \u2019em in the hallway. Give \u2019em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.",
        "I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that\u2019s the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she\u2019s in Phoenix. Illuminating.",
        "This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I\u2019m right on the other side of this wall.   used to be a window here. There\u2019s not anymore. So, that\u2019s where I will be.",
        "So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don\u2019t hesitate to ask. I\u2019m right here.",
        "Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the \u2018bucks.",
        "It\u2019s like a slang for Starbucks. They\u2019re all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don\u2019t have the good stuff here.",
        "Nah, it\u2019s not. it\u2019s spppplllibbb",
        "No, here\u2019s the thing. Y\u2019know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they\u2019re always putting up walls and I\u2019m always tearing \u2019em down, just breakin\u2019 down barriers, that\u2019s what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?",
        "Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.",
        "There ya go. Nice steaming cup o\u2019joe.",
        "I have an idea.  Why don\u2019t I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?",
        "Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?",
        "Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?",
        "You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we\u2019re all millionaires. I\u2019m probably closest. So here\u2019s Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.",
        "Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.",
        "I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he\u2019d never heard that before he worked here?",
        "I know, it\u2019s unbelievable.",
        "Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.",
        "Toby, Katy.",
        "Toby\u2019s divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?",
        "You and your wife, and you have kids.",
        "Oh that so \u2013 that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?",
        "Okay. Alright. Cool.  See ya in a bit.  Oh, she\u2019s cute.  Cutie-pie. Back to work.",
        "I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike.",
        "Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?   So how\u2019s that uh, coffee from earlier?",
        "Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing.  So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?",
        "Busted.",
        "Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something.  I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.",
        "Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.",
        "Oh, I know what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re not prying this out of my hands, but don\u2019t tempt me because I\u2019ll give it to you!",
        "Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It\u2019s a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It\u2019s not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!",
        "Oh the rotating um, steam wand.  What? What\u2019s the matter?",
        "Oh, oh! God. I\u2019m sorry. Is there\u2026?",
        "Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.",
        "Seriously. No, really.",
        "God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I\u2019m out of here at five sharp.",
        "I can go earlier. \u2018Cause I\u2019m the boss. You know, whatever. I\u2019m out of here slaves.",
        "What?",
        "Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.  Five o\u2019clock sharp.  I will give you and your purses a ride home.",
        "Excellent.",
        "Great. Cool. Cool.  Yeah, okay.",
        "I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..",
        "No it\u2019s not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I\u2019m onto\u2014",
        "No, no, no it\u2019s not against the rules.  She\u2019s not a permanent employee so it\u2019s not.",
        "But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.",
        "She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.",
        "Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot\u2026",
        "No. I cannot promise you that.",
        "Listen, Dwight.",
        "Dwight, no. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s too early to tell. I don\u2019t know how I feel.",

        "Very easy to clean.",
        "Okay. Like he\u2019s going to win anyway, right?",
        "Did we get any mail?",
        "Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin\u2019. Just checkin\u2019, double checkin\u2019, checkin\u2019 on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and\u2026",
        "Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?",
        "Ryan.",
        "Would you like to help me with a special project?",
        "Alright.",
        "Okay, just throw out all the empties.",
        "Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.",
        "No.",
        "Uh, what flavor?",
        "Blue\u2019s not a flavor.",

        "What, stop! Whoa! That\u2019s my Drakkar Noir.",

        "Give me a break. Umm\u2026 Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl\u2019s outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?",
        "I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.",
        "No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?",
        "She would have definitely slept with me.",
        "Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!",
        "What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her \u201cpartner\u201d in to work?  Would that be crossing the line?",
        "What if they made out? In front of everybody?",
        "At home? And I told everybody everything about it.",
        "Okay. Well, then let\u2019s act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be\u2026 Okay! We\u2019ll use the doll. Pam. Pam?",
        "I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um\u2026 we have to watch, uh, Toby\u2019s video that he\u2019s showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?",
        "That\u2019s what she said. Pam?",
        "That\u2019s what she sai   Nope, but\u2026 Okay. Well, suit yourself.",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\u2026 Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.",
        "Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we\u2019re watching that Corporate gave us\u2026 Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.",
        "So you are the lawyer, Mr. O\u2019Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.",
        "Well, it\u2019s probably because you don\u2019t get \u2019em.",
        "When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don\u2019t come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn\u2019t arrest a guy who\u2019s just delivering drugs from one guy to another.",
        "The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can\u2019t say anything.",
        "Where\u2019s the line? Where\u2019s the line, Jan.",
        "No, I\u2019ve seen the video.",
        "No, I didn\u2019t.  Huh, what?",
        "Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out\u2026 we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.",
        "Mmmhmm. Yes.",
        "THAT\u2019S WHAT SHE SAID!",
        "Come on.",
        "Mwah!",
        "You would have done the same. You just didn\u2019t think of it first.",
        "It\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026",
        "Okay.  Hello.  Jan. Mr. O\u2019Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.",
        "I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.",
        "This guy does it all.",
        "What?",
        "So I\u2019m not in trouble?",
        "I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can\u2019t be too careful about what you say. Mo\u2019 money, mo\u2019 problems.",
        "Okay. Well, let\u2019s get you out of here, James. Um\u2026 I think we\u2019re under an hour still, so\u2026",
        "I know. We\u2019ll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.",
        "No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.",
        "Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.",
        "No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.",
        "I don\u2019t know about that.",
        "Well, I have a late birthday and usually September\u2019s a cut-off point.  You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There\u2019s a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.",
        "Yes, your corner. Go.",
        "Mmmhmmm.",
        "They didn\u2019t get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.  C\u2019mere, c\u2019mere, c\u2019mon!  Come on! Come on.",
        "Oooh!",
        "I\u2019m not worried.",
        "You know what? The only thing I\u2019m worried about\u2026 is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.",
        "Times have changed a little. And even though we\u2019re still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can\u2019t take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.",
        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "What?",
        "I don\u2019t get what you mean.",
        "Well, you said I looked thin, so what does\u2026 Does that mean I\u2019m like thin weird or thin handsome or\u2026",
        "Yes, well, of course. Of course.",
        "No, but I\u2019m saying hypothetically if we were dating\u2026",
        "Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out.",
        "You say yes, and we go out.",
        "And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.",
        "I\u2019m an early bird, and I\u2019m a night owl. So I\u2019m wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.",
        "Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.",
        "Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don\u2019t you take a couple hours. The office is yours. \u201cHome Alone,\u201d \u201cRisky Business.\u201d Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.",
        "Ok.  Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.",
        "Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.",
        "Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they\u2019d throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.",
        "Maybe.",
        "Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.",
        "Sign the papers at the condo.",
        "Uh, I don\u2019t need one.",
        "I don\u2019t need a representative.",
        "No, No.",
        "No. Dwight. I\u2019m fine.",
        "Well, this isn\u2019t about work. This is closing on a condo, it\u2019s completely personal.",
        "Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.",
        "Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.",
        "As my associate.",
        "No it is not.",
        "Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that\u2019s the way they talk in movies.",
        "We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don\u2019t you have everybody work on their expense reports and I\u2019d like them in by the end of the day.",
        "Very good.",
        "We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?",
        "Good. The Small Business Man?",
        "Maxim? American Way? Cracked?",
        "How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?",
        "NO, well can you get on that, because I don\u2019t just read Cracked.  Thank you.",
        "Ok. See you soon.",
        "I don\u2019t know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?",
        "What? No, Dwight. It\u2019s fifty degrees outside.  Don\u2019t\u2026 please\u2026",
        "I\u2026 Just\u2026 Would you put it up?  Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.",
        "I do not understand what you spend your money on.",
        "Home, sweet home.",
        "Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back\u2026 wait\u2026  no, it\u2019s this one, right here. Home, sweet home.",
        "Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He\u2019d always get rolled over by something.",
        "Nice to meet you too.",
        "Yeah, small. I\u2019m buying it and I\u2019m not renting it. So, it\u2019s still an upgrade. He doesn\u2019t know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.",
        "Oh. Good. That\u2019s good. It\u2019s good to be accommodating of that.",
        "This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness.  Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.",
        "I\u2019m putting my bed right over here.",
        "Well, then I will get a warrantee.",
        "Well then I won\u2019t get a warrantee.",
        "So that\u2019s the problem, is solved. What?",
        "Uh\u2026 Ten year.",
        "What? Wha? You said ten.",
        "Ok, ok, ok.",
        "Alright.",
        "Ok. Alright. Oh boy.",
        "Um. Oh.  Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?",
        "Um. I\u2019m going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.",
        "Oh, man.",
        "Uh.",
        "The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026",
        "\u2026know if you showed me this same unit or not.",
        "Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.",
        "As far as I can tell, I\u2019m the best-looking person here.",
        "There\u2019s a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It\u2019s just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you\u2019ve no place to go but down.",
        "No, no, no.",
        "I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.",
        "Ehhhh\u2026.",
        "I made the right decision. I\u2019m glad I signed. I\u2019m a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We\u2019re having fun.",
        "There\u2019s something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.",
        "No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you\u2019ve really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.",
        "Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.",
        "I\u2019m thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we\u2019ll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you\u2019re, you know, you\u2019re gone.",
        "What the hell is a terrarium?",
        "Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.",
        "We take separate cars.",
        "Why would we do that?",
        "No.",
        "EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I\u2019m sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I\u2019m \u2026 Ok.",
        "Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.",
        "Nobody likes beets.",
        "Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don\u2019t you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I\u2019d love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.",
        "Stop it!",
        "Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What\u2019s going\u2026 What\u2019s going on?",
        "Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It\u2019s very cool. It\u2019s a three bedroom, gay-friendly.",
        "You know.",
        "Really?",
        "What\u2019s this?",
        "I don\u2019t really know what to say. Um, I\u2019m not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.",
        "Get up here, Dwight.",
        "Yep, not as good as gold.  Why are you playing the national anthem?",
        "Oh.  What the hell is that?",
        "Oh, okay. I\u2019ll tell you. Let\u2019s see here. Three bedroom, two bath\u2026",

        "Are we ready?",
        "Are we gonna do it?",
        "Ah, the volunteer Sheriff station.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, anything bad?",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "No.",
        "I don\u2019t need a gun.",
        "Hello! How are you? I\u2019m, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we\u2019re going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what\u2019s the vibe? What\u2019s the vibe of this place?",
        "Oh\u2026 That\u2019s gonna change.",
        "Because I loves to party and I\u2019m gonna be partying my butt out at this place.",
        "Here\u2019s a question for you. I have a convertible. Is it safe that park that in my driveway.  All right. See you soon. Good guy. Um, cool.",
        "Oh, Carol. Hello, how are you?",
        "Good to see you.",
        "What?  What are you doing in there?",
        "Oh, my God. Dwight.",
        "You know what I might do, I might make this into a kids\u2019 room.",
        "I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place. I\u2019m gonna get married and I\u2019m gonna have kids.",
        "I\u2019m not gonna date a 55-year-old woman.",
        "No, it\u2019s not. Just shut up.",
        "You\u2019re an ass. Shut it.",
        "No, you don\u2019t.",

        "Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he\u2019s kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.",
        "Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent!",
        "Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?",

        "Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.",
        "Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That\u2019s rule number two.",
        "So what was rule two?",
        "Okay, well, let\u2019s\u2026 . let\u2019s kind of take it a little slower.",

        "Shut, it. Can I\u2026 can I just do it please?  Uh, it\u2019s equal.",
        "Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.",

        "Stop. Dwight. You know what? You\u2019re acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He\u2019s not your five year old brother, Dwight. He\u2019s a valued member of this company\u2026 and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.",
        "I did not go to business school. You know who else didn\u2019t go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So\u2026 so it\u2019s not the same thing. At all.",

        "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "No, I\u2019m not trying to trick him. I\u2019m trying to be a good mentor. So\u2026",
        "No.",
        "No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.",
        "I\u2019m not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.",
        "Happy Halloween, everyone!  Oh\u2026 that\u2019s great!",
        "Ohh\u2026 OK.",
        "I know why she\u2019s calling. It\u2019s the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow I\u2019m supposed to put on a costume and smile.  Okay.",
        "Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.",
        "Well, I\u2019m gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it\u2019s best to wait till the end of the day.",
        "I don\u2019t know\u2026 yet. I will have to call her back.",
        "Okay\u2026 Sherri?",
        "If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?",
        "Thanks.",
        "I\u2019ll call her back.  Wish I could fire Sherri.",
        "Okay! I\u2019m sorry.",
        "No?",
        "Bye.",
        "I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It\u2019s\u2026 these are people\u2019s lives you\u2019re talking about.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeeesh.",
        "Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do.",
        "Because it\u2019s very scary stuff.",
        "You\u2019re worried about the party? There\u2019s a man\u2019s life at stake here.",
        "No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance\u2026 and who you think deserved to be fired \u2013 who would that be?",
        "And\u2026 sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.",
        "I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog.",
        "Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.",
        "Hey.",
        "You guys excited about the party?",
        "It\u2019s gonna be fun.",
        "Oh, boy\u2026 look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.",
        "All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?",
        "Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I\u2019ll approve the overages. Sound good?",
        "Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I\u2019m  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I\u2019m going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.",
        "Well, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.",
        "Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.",
        "\u201cBend It Like Beckham.\u201d",
        "Yeah. That would be perfect.",
        "Well, I don\u2019t really have two heads. So\u2026",
        "Who do you think it should be?",
        "No, Jim brings in money.",
        "Eh.",
        "It\u2019s not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.",
        "What? There was someone left off that list? Who?",
        "You\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t even think of him.",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s actually a really good idea.",
        "Yeah\u2026 I could.",
        "I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what he said.",
        "What?",
        "That is not a very nice thing to say about him.",
        "Are you kidding?",
        "I agree. He\u2019d land on his feet.",
        "So. How did it go with Stanley? How\u2026 how\u2019d he take it?",
        "Ahh, come on.",
        "I don\u2019t wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I\u2019m certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just\u2026",
        "Oh, God.",
        "Fantastic!",
        "What?! That would\u2019ve solved all my problems.",
        "Oh, you idiot.",
        "If you left, I wouldn\u2019t have to fire anybody.",
        "Big deal. Oh, it would\u2019ve worked out so well. Can you get it back?",
        "You can call. Can you call \u2019em?",
        "Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.",
        "Can I speak to you a minute?",
        "Help. Me.",
        "I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.",
        "Yes.",
        "I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.",
        "No, no, no. That\u2019s just the first thing\u2026 came\u2026 in head.",
        "Yes, that\u2019s a good idea.",
        "Aaaahh! I\u2019m gonna kill myself!",
        "I\u2019m going to kill myself, and it\u2019s your fault!",
        "Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they\u2019re saying this has to be done by the end of the month.",
        "I\u2026 this is Creed.",
        "I\u2019m improvising, so just try to keep up.",
        "And I\u2019m very angry, and I want\u2026",
        "I\u2019m gonna kill you. I\u2019m going to kill you for firing me.",
        "Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just\u2026 yeah.",
        "Uh, hey\u2026 Creed?",
        "Could I talk to you for a second?",
        "You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you\u2019d wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.",
        "I\u2026 we\u2019re gonna have to\u2026 You\u2026 you want something better.",
        "No, you wanna leave.",
        "Why\u2026 why are you making this so hard?",
        "I think you\u2019re right.",
        "No, of course  you can\u2019t go. We haven\u2019t even started this horrible process of\u2026 okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you\u2019re a great guy, and I like you, you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re, goodbye.",
        "Hmm?",
        "What old days? What are you talking about?",
        "It\u2019s right here on the desk, yeah.",
        "I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t\u2026",
        "I can\u2019t change anything. This is the way\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t\u2026 okay, just listen.",
        "Don\u2019t\u2026",
        "Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?",
        "I have to fire someone today, okay?",
        "Okay, well\u2026 I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you\u2019re always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.",
        "Don\u2019t\u2026",
        "Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?",
        "Well, he\u2026",
        "Well, maybe I did.",
        "Huh. No! I can\u2019t, no. I can\u2019t go back. I would look like an idiot.",
        "No.",
        "No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and\u2026",
        "I just hope that you and I can remain friends.",
        "Devon, wait, please.",
        "Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili\u2019s. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.",
        "I  love Halloween. You know, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just fun. Every year, it\u2019s just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson\u2019s boob. It was topical. People got a\u2026 a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.",
        "He\u2026 Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.",
        "You look great! And you\u2019re a princess?",
        "A fairy princess. You\u2019re very\u2026 .",
        "You\u2019re a lion.  Wow, I want to hear your, your\u2026 Oh!  Oh, okay, that\u2019s all yours. That\u2019s all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.",
        "Of course. You\u2019re always working hard.",
        "Keep it up. And there\u2019s Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do.",
        "No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything\u2019s great. Just keep living your lives. Everything\u2019s gonna be fine.  You are all such wonderful, innocent people.",
        "What? What?",
        "Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it\u2019s you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can\u2019t say that I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s a relief.",
        "You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you\u2019re not doing your job. Why don\u2019t you just resign?",
        "Just know that if I could have fired you, I would have.",
        "You know what? That\u2019s my foot.",
        "You guys\u2026",
        "I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct?",
        "I don\u2019t know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?",
        "Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.",
        "All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided.  Wow, that\u2019s  a fast elevator.",
        "Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative.",
        "Leave me alone, okay?",
        "Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement.",
        "Why?",
        "It\u2019s just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Just trying to be your friend.",
        "Of course, I did. I always\u2026 Yes, I do.",
        "Are you pulling my leg or\u2026",
        "You have no clue why I\u2019ve asked you in here?",
        "Oh, here we go. This\u2026 um, here\u2019s the deal.",
        "His name was Devon.",
        "The human being man\u2019s name was Devon.",
        "Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "Uh, well, I am. A little. Justifiably. My Halloween is ruined.",
        "Do you? I don\u2019t think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me.",
        "You\u2019re glad?",
        "Thanks. Thanks so much. You think it was good?",
        "Think I did a good job? Great. I feel good. I\u2019m gonna give myself a pat on the back.",
        "There. I\u2019m doing it. Right there. Great.",
        "Yeah, blah, blah, blah.",
        "You people are revolting. By far, the least popular people here. I should have fired you. Who knew Devon was so popular and had so many friends. So well-loved.",
        "I don\u2019t want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.",
        "Uhh, yes, I did, here\u2019s the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.",
        "Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.",
        "Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.",
        "Last year they were out of order, weren\u2019t they Pam?",
        "Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That\u2019s pretty good. Um, actually, I\u2019m sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.",
        "Is it a priority? Oh I don\u2019t know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People\u2019s legs are crushed under rubble. \u201cPlease, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can\u2019t because we don\u2019t have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn\u2019t a priority.\u201d Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That\u2019s the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.",
        "Catch-22. Yes. Why don\u2019t you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what\u2019s your cell?",
        "Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.",
        "This is Tito.",
        "Calling from\u2026",
        "Pick up.",
        "This is Mike Tyson.",
        "And this is more a ying-yang thing. The \u2018Michael\u2019 all cursive, the \u2018Scott\u2019 all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.",
        "Yeah, yeah, I don\u2019t think that would happen.",
        "Because I would kick his ass.",
        "So? I\u2019ve beaten up black belts.",
        "They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I\u2019m just lucky I got out.",
        "And after that, nobody ever messed with the \u2018Damn Rascals\u2019 ever again.",
        "You were a Jet?",
        "Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t\u2019s and dot some i\u2019s. Alright, I\u2019m going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That\u2019s my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.",
        "I\u2019m friends with everybody in this office. We\u2019re all best friends \u2013 I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren\u2019t dentist appointments. And that\u2019s when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.",
        "Just hit me. You\u2019ll see.",
        "Oh, queer\u2026  eye. Queer eye. That\u2019s a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.",
        "Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.",
        "Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented \u2018Armageddon\u2019\u2026",
        "\u2026 he cried at the end of it. He did.",
        "Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?",
        "Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.",
        "Fuuuaaaahhhhh\u2026 oohhhhh!",
        "Yeah.  Thank you.",
        "Go away.",
        "I haven\u2019t signed them, ok?",
        "Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can\u2019t stop you from being mugged. He\u2019s just not tough enough.",
        "Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That\u2019s ridiculous. I could murder him.",
        "Oh, so that\u2019s what they are saying?",
        "Ok, alright, where is Dwight?",
        "Ok.",
        "Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.",
        "No, Really?",
        "Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.",
        "Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.",
        "Really?",
        "You know what? You\u2019re just lucky that we are at work right now.",
        "No, they must have class.",
        "Look\u2026",
        "Hey, Toby.",
        "I\u2019ve got an idea: why don\u2019t you leave right now. Why don\u2019t you walk away from the room, \u2018kay? Fine. We\u2019ll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.",
        "I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.",
        "I think it is. A guy told me about that.",
        "Oh.",
        "Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn\u2019t have any rules. Maybe one \u2013 no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.",
        "Hey!",
        "What the hell was that?",
        "No.",
        "Alright, that\u2019s the way you want it.",
        "Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.",
        "I\u2019m comin\u2019 atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.",
        "I got his pants.",
        "Dwight, you have\u2026 No, you have something\u2026 God, you look like such an idiot!",
        "Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.",
        "You can\u2019t see. You can\u2019t see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win.  Eight points. Nine points.",
        "Open your mouth.",
        "You talkin\u2019 to me? You talkin\u2019 to me? \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work\u2026 Oh, oh check this out. Come here.  There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This\u2019ll be hilarious.  Oh, we\u2019re playing phone tag.",
        "My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?",
        "Yeah\u2026 uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?",
        "He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I\u2019ll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?",
        "If you\u2019re doing anything crazy, give me a shout.",
        "Alright, bye.",
        "Dwight?",
        "This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?",
        "Well,  busier. Making the time.",
        "Well, you don\u2019t even have anyone to go home to, Toby.",
        "I know, but I\u2019ve been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it\u2019d might help me out. What do you say? Let\u2019s gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.",
        "I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?",
        "And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.",
        "I know, I know, I know, I wouldn\u2019t be offering it if I didn\u2019t think you could handle it.",
        "No, no, title change only.",
        "No, no. Three month probationary period. Let\u2019s not tell anybody about this right now.",
        "Absolutely but not really.",
        "Yes you do.",
        "And, ditto.",
        "I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.",
        "Yeah, I don\u2019t think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I\u2019m just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I\u2019m talking about.",
        "I\u2019ve never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.",
        "No, that\u2019s not how I meant it.",
        "Shut up, Dwight.",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang.  Oh, stretchin\u2019. I like to stay tight. Compact.",
        "Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?",
        "God, you look like such an idiot.",
        "Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn\u2019t much of a fight, actually.",
        "I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.",
        "I went medieval on his heinie.",
        "Hey, Stanley. I don\u2019t tell you how to do your job, do I? He\u2026",
        "Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That\u2019s not how business works, okay?  Okay.",

I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I\u2019m not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not.   Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we\u2019re gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.   Adios!",

I don\u2019t even, I don\u2019t even use a plate anymore.  Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg  I know, I know!

I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, let\u2019s, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one: \u201cWhat should we do to prepare for Y2K?\u201d",

Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it\u2019s something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that we\u2019ve learned this, let\u2019s continue.  See, this is good, we\u2019re learning and we\u2019re figuring some stuff out.  \u201cYou need to do something about your coffee breath\u201d-",

        "Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was\u2026 He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don\u2019t know how she dealt with that as long as she did.",

But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.",

        "Shut it. No, it\u2019s not. Okay, just give it a shot.",
        "Okay, Meredith is up first. Here\u2019s the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else\u2019s gift that they\u2019ve already gotten, like the oven mitt.",
        "Yankee Swap! That\u2019s what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.",
        "I think this is going great.",
        "Everyone wants the iPod. It\u2019s a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.",
        "Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.",

        "Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.",
        "Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don\u2019t know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.",

        "Yeah, that sounds good.",
        "Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What\u2019s better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It\u2019s really the greatest day of all time.",

        "Dwight is\u2026 Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.",
        "Well, thank God you didn\u2019t steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.",
        "Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt.",
        "See, that\u2019s what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, \u201cMan, I wish I got that.\u201d I mean, that\u2019s just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, just makes you kind of feel good.",
        "Hello, everyone.",
        "Ah! Ha ha ha!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Stanley! Bo banley.",
        "Banana fana fo fanley.",
        "Be my mo manley.",
        "Stanley.",
        "Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Maybe, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Well, no. But\u2026 okay, don\u2019t spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.",
        "It\u2019s cheaper.",
        "This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I\u2019m going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.",
        "It is now time to unveil the destination of this year\u2019s retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It\u2019s a booze cruise!",
        "No. This is mandatory. But don\u2019t worry, you know what? You\u2019re gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.",
        "Well, this\u2026",
        "Yeah?",
        "To throw you off the scent.",
        "Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.",
        "Well, that\u2019s not my fault, okay? Just.. we\u2019re not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you\u2019re all thinking, \u201cWho is this smart little cookie?\u201d Her name is Brenda\u2026 something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.",
        "I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and\u2026 it wasn\u2019t the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I\u2019ve incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.",
        "Leader\u2026 ship. The word \u201cship\u201d is hidden inside the word \u201cleadership,\u201d as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we\u2019re all in the same boat. Teamwork!",
        "Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?",
        "Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.",
        "All right, let\u2019s not get hung up on the furnace. This just\u2026 it\u2019s the sales\u2026 I see the sales department down there. They\u2019re in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!",
        "Titanic?",
        "No, I\u2019m Leo DiCaprio! Come on!",
        "No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They\u2019re happy down there in the furnace room. And they\u2019re dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they\u2019re singing their ethnic songs, and\u2026 actually, that might be warehouse.",
        "The\u2026 no, no. No, I didn\u2019t\u2026 okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I\u2019m saying is\u2026 leadership. We\u2019ll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.",
        "A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.",
        "Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey.  Uh\u2026 the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring\u2026  We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.",
        "I\u2019d rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.",
        "Okay.",
        "In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It\u2019s nebulose.",
        "Hey, look! I\u2019m king of the world!",
        "And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!",
        "Okay! So\u2026",
        "Right.",
        "But don\u2019t worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.",
        "I\u2019m your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna\u2026",
        "Rock it!",
        "If the boat\u2019s a-rockin\u2019, don\u2019t come knockin\u2019!",
        "Yep.",
        "We\u2019re all gonna have a good time tonight!",
        "Hm? Okay. Yep.",
        "Having fun?",
        "Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.",
        "Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so\u2026 right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.",
        "So, okay.",
        "But before that, I have to do my presentation.",
        "All right, we\u2019ll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!",
        "Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that\u2019s always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.",
        "Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?",
        "No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.",
        "Okay, well, obviously you don\u2019t know anything about leadership.",
        "Okay.",
        "Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.",
        "I don\u2019t want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?",
        "Well\u2026 could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!",
        "Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!",
        "Then I\u2019ll give you away!",
        "Captain Jack is a fart face. I\u2019m on medication.",
        "Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It\u2019s time to be boss. It\u2019s time to motivate. Let\u2019s blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We\u2019re going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it\u2019s my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren\u2019t enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It\u2019s a scary\u2026 it\u2019s a\u2026",
        "It\u2019s a predicament, and it\u2019s something that each and every one of us has to think about.",
        "I\u2019m in the brig. See? The boat\u2019s not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was\u2026 if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.",
        "Is somebody there?",
        "Captain Jack has a problem with authority.",
        "He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.",
        "Well, it\u2019s nice for you. Your friend got engaged.",
        "Roy said the first one didn\u2019t count.",
        "Really? You\u2019re kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan\u2026",
        "Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.",
        "Well, if you like her so much, don\u2019t give up.",
        "BFD. Engaged ain\u2019t married.",
        "Never, ever, ever give up.",
        "It\u2019s a fake wheel, dummy.",
        "Hello.",
        "Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Have a seat.",
        "Oh, every man\u2019s dream.",
        "Two ladies at once. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, you heard something. Um, yeah, it\u2019s a booze cruise, but it\u2026 There\u2019s more to the story than that. It\u2026",
        "Leadership off-site. Uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme\u2026",
        "Yeah, I don\u2019t even know why I said booze cruise. I don\u2019t even think there\u2019s booze on the boat.",
        "Of course.",
        "Of course, of course. Yes. Yes. Look, I have a whole program planned. Jan, this program is going to change people\u2019s lives. I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.",
        "Hello.",
        "Oh, cool. Cool. And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night. Awkward. That\u2019s\u2026 You know what. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?",
        "Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?",
        "Thanks.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "I\u2019ll see you later.",
        "I\u2019ll call you later.",
        "That\u2019s like\u2026",
        "I\u2019ll call you, too.  So. You are probably gonna get carded, so I can make you a fake ID. We have a laminating machine.",
        "I\u2019m not giving you the answer. Deck hands is one. And\u2026",
        "No, I\u2019m first mate. You\u2019re second mate. I\u2019m first mate, as the captain.",
        "Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well\u2026  Tell you about Toby later, he\u2019s awful.",
        "Oh, hey, Toby. So\u2026 It\u2019s an analogy.",
        "Idiot.",
        "No, no, no. That\u2019s his punishment for not being here on time. Too bad, anchor!",
        "Your problem now, Captain Jack.",
        "Flash cards.",
        "You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.",
        "That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let\u2019s, uh,\u2026 Let\u2019s rock. Let\u2019s rock some stuff here, okay?  Okay\u2026 I\u2019m hearing a little too much reverb.  Can we down the reverb? All right. Follow my lead.  Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What?",
        "You know what? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in\u2026",
        "That\u2019s not in tune. I don\u2019t know if you can\u2026",
        "\u2026make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don\u2019t know. It is a defective ax, my friend.",
        "Good luck.",
        "Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I\u2019m old.",
        "Yeah! Toast!",
        "That\u2019s my line! That\u2019s my line, That\u2019s\u2026 I always say that at weddings. So I\u2019ll just think of something else to say. I\u2026",
        "Thanks.",
        "Pam! It\u2019s Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.",
        "I\u2019m hurt, I have hurt myself.  Oh my God!",
        "Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!",
        "No, I want you to pick me up.",
        "I am hurt. I hurt my foot.",
        "I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up.",
        "OH GOD!",
        "Oh God!",
        "OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.",
        "I enjoy having breakfast in bed.  I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.  And since I don\u2019t have a butler, I have to do it myself.  So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill.  Then I go to sleep.  When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again.  Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.  It is delicious, it\u2019s good for me.  It\u2019s the perfect way to start the day.  Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot\u2026 that\u2019s it.  I don\u2019t see what\u2019s so hard to believe about that.",
        "Pam, could you come get me?!",
        "Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?",
        "There\u2019s no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan\u2026 tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell \u2019em that?",
        "I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.",
        "No one wants to pick me up!?",
        "I\u2019m not sick! I\u2019m burned!",
        "Don\u2019t\u2026 is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.",
        "I don\u2019t want Dwight!",
        "I don\u2019t have a girlfriend.",
        "It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.",
        "Hellooo? \u2026 Please don\u2019t send Dwight!",
        "Morning everyone.  Don\u2019t freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I\u2019ve been through.",
        "Did you explain why?",
        "Burned my foot, Pam.",
        "Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you.",
        "Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping\u2026",
        "Thank you.  Pam, messages please?",
        "Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and\u2026",
        "No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!",
        "What?",
        "I don\u2019t want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who\u2019s undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too much to ask.",
        "No, I don\u2019t want some aspirin, yeah I\u2019m a little fussy.  Aspirin\u2019s not gonna do a damn thing.  I\u2019m sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.",
        "What?  Part of your duties are to what?",
        "You just said \u201cpart of your duties are to\u201d something.",
        "Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you?",
        "Where is my cornbread?",
        "Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?",
        "Where are the yams?",
        "Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?",
        "And they had no yams?",
        "How strange.  Because they always have yams.",
        "Pam\u2026 PAAAM!?",
        "Come here please.",
        "I want you to rub butter on my foot.",
        "Pam, please?  I have Country Crock.",
        "Uh, ow.  Ryan! \u2026 Ryaaaaan \u2026 RYYYYAN!",
        "No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, I\u2019m not gonna call Jan.  She\u2019d just worry\u2026 drive down here and make a big thing\u2026 Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?",
        "No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!",
        "I fell off the toilet.  I\u2019m caught between the toilet and the wall.",
        "Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam.",
        "Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me.  and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.",
        "No, he\u2019s not.",
        "I just saw him.",
        "Ugh, forget it.  I\u2019ll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!",
        "Can I have everyone\u2019s attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who\u2019s supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it\u2019s like to be disabled?  Oscar?",
        "No, never heard of it.  No, a <i>real</i> disability, not a woman\u2019s trouble.",
        "Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I\u2019m sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.",
        "Ok,  what does this look like to you Stanley?!",
        "Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.",
        "I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody\u2019s in there!",
        "While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.",
        "Good question.  Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia : AIDS.",
        "I don\u2019t think so, no.",
        "He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works.  A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?",
        "What you mean uh hmmm\u2026 ?",
        "Ok.",
        "Yes, right in here, come on in.",
        "This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.",
        "You are so brave. You are so brave.",
        "But it\u2019s hard for you! Right? Because you\u2019re in a wheelchair.",
        "Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?",
        "Oh my God, that\u2019s three times as long as it takes me.",
        "How did you get in your wheelchair?",
        "Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.",
        "Well, that\u2019s good, he still has a sense of humor.",
        "Well they notice it.  Don\u2019t you?  You notice it.  It\u2019s the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Ok\u2026",
        "Ignore him.  You know what?  We\u2019re not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick\u2026",
        "Yeah\u2026",
        "Ok.",
        "Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.",
        "Hey!",
        "You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.",
        "Did you get the yams?",
        "Ok, I\u2019ll just have the pudding.",
        "Yeh.",
        "You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.",
        "Yeah, baby, I am feelin\u2019 better.  My body\u2019s literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.",
        "Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.",
        "Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.",
        "Why don\u2019t you go with him?",
        "I can\u2019t take you, I don\u2019t have my car and yours is all vomity.",
        "Oh, ok, that\u2019s, great.  No, I can\u2019t drive.  Jim why don\u2019t you drive.",
        "We\u2019ll go.  I\u2019m still recovering. So let\u2019s just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.",
        "Shotgun!",
        "The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout \u201cshotgun\u201d when you\u2019re within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That\u2019s how  the game\u2019s played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.",
        "Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith\u2019s problem?",
        "Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She\u2019s not gonna find one driving this thing around.",
        "Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I\u2019m so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.",
        "I know, just sayin\u2019.",
        "Dwight, what are you drinking?",
        "Give it to me.",
        "Dwight\u2026  You just keep your eyes on the road.   Give me the bottle or you\u2019re fired.",
        "Give it to me Dwight.",
        "Give me the bottle!!",
        "Gimme the bottle, Dwight!",
        "Just give it!",
        "Stop, stop it! Stop spraying!  Gimme the bottle!",
        "Stop spraying me!  Gimme the bottle!",
        "Dwight, what is your middle name.",
        "Something with a \u201cK\u201d.",
        "What do I write under \u201creason for visit\u201d?",
        "Nothing.  I wrote \u201cbringing someone to the hospital\u201d.",
        "No\u2026 you know what Jim, this isn\u2019t about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him.",
        "Hi Dwight.",
        "Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?",
        "Well, you don\u2019t have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.",
        "Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?",
        "Ok, what kinda machine is that?",
        "That\u2019s my joke, damnit Dwight.",
        "It\u2019s ok, they\u2019re with me.",
        "Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.",
        "Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  We\u2019ll, see you when you get out.",
        "Fine. Fine.",
        "Uh, that\u2019s what she said.  See, haven\u2019t lost my sense of humor.  No, no need, it was a non-stick grill.",
        "Right, I\u2019m gonna spend the day in the hospital, bujehh.  Bureaucracy and germs.",
        "Yes, so, no thank you.",
        "What?",
        "Wow, I don\u2019t want to hear\u2026 you talk.  Pam, could I have a word with you in my office?   Oh, oh, oh.  Alright.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019ve been sayin that.",
        "Did you know I used to be in HR?",
        "I used to be in HR.  I was a Hell raiser.",
        "Right?",
        "Alright. Movin\u2019 on.",
        "Ry-an.  You\u2019re here.  Whatcha got, whatcha got?  Alright, Panic Room, Maverick, Nell, Sommersby, The Accused.  Where\u2019s Little Man Tate?",
        "Oh come on.",
        "Oh man.  It\u2019s not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy.",
        "No.",
        "No, I\u2019m not calling your weirdo cousin.  Twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm.",
        "Guh-od.",
        "Ok, I\u2019ll stand near you.",
        "Next-ish.",
        "Shh shh shh shh.",
        "No. Do you?",
        "Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where\u2019s the funny? Give it to me.",
        "What\u2019s up-dog?",
        "Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that\u2019s brilliant!",
        "Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?",
        "Mmm, what flavour coffee is that?  Up-dog?",
        "I don\u2019t know, nothin\u2019, what\u2019s up with you?",
        "No, damn it!",
        "What does what mean?",
        "Just forget it.",
        "Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?",
        "Gotcha!  Oh, God.  Crap! Nothin\u2019 how ya doing?",
        "Damn it.",
        "Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don\u2019t have to do in the spring?  Anything.  They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.  Well I say that an empty desk means a\u2026",
        "No, that\u2019s not\u2026 no, that\u2019s not what I was going to say.",
        "Yes.",
        "On a Friday?",
        "I will do all the talking.",
        "What difference does it make whether your here?",
        "Hi, Oscar its Michael.",
        "Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?",
        "Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know it\u2019s cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.",
        "What are your symptoms?",
        "Umm, hmmm.",
        "I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you\u2019re still sick.  So have a great long weekend.",
        "He sounded sick.",
        "That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking.",
        "Yeah. Drop what you\u2019re doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can\u2019t function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.",
        "Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don\u2019t you wear your hair like that all the time.  It\u2019s much sexier.   Man, this must be torture for you.",
        "Hey Jim-bag.",
        "Really?",
        "Who else knows?",
        "Wow!",
        "Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.",
        "My lips are sealed.  My lips are sealed\u2026 Bangles.",
        "Can you hear me, they talk about us\u2026",
        "Hey, whatcha gettin\u2019?",
        "Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?",
        "Any of em?  So, uh, what\u2019s the 411? Any news on the \u201cP\u201d situation?",
        "P-A-M. P-A",
        "No it\u2019s okay, we\u2019re talking code.",
        "Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?",
        "Alright, well, cool.  Still deciding?",
        "Peach iced tea. You\u2019re going to hate it.",
        "It\u2019s Grrrrrrape! Soda.",
        "Not so much.",
        "Nothing.",
        "Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.",
        "Um, I don\u2019t know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.",
        "Ok.",
        "Good.",
        "Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin\u2019 for lunch?",
        "Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why don\u2019t, why don\u2019t I take you out to lunch? My treat.",
        "Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some \u2018za. Talk about you know who.",
        "I know just he place.",
        "Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?",
        "Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.",
        "Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o\u2019clock. Hi.",
        "We\u2019re not worthy. We\u2019re not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.",
        "I\u2019m his boss actually.  And I treat him well. I\u2019m taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.",
        "Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?",
        "Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken.",
        "No, I\u2019m gonna have the gourmet hot dog.",
        "What do you like best about Pam?",
        "Is it her boobs, or\u2026",
        "Really?",
        "Never get\u2019s any of my jokes.",
        "Her boobs, definitely.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "Ohhh happy birthday Jim!",
        "Woo! Yeah!",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Hilarious. Hey.",
        "Just go to his house and see if he\u2019s sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.",
        "Just do it.",
        "Expenses.",
        "No. It\u2019s\u2026 I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s a business lunch.",
        "No he did not. I don\u2019t need his permission.",
        "Uhhh it\u2019s ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don\u2019t understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?",
        "I put a cigarette through a freakin\u2019 quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.",
        "Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?",
        "You\u2019re not his friend, you don\u2019t know. He is in love with a girl he works with who\u2019s engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?",
        "You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam\u2026 and me.",
        "I know, I know, I know.",
        "I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just\u2026 I know. I\u2019m just, I just hope that, I just hope that  this doesn\u2019t affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.",
        "Ok, I\u2019m fine, no I know, I\u2019m good, I\u2019m good, it\u2019s just.",
        "Yeah I\u2019m good.",
        "Yeah I\u2019m fine. Look, about you and Jim.",
        "No, I feel it\u2019s my responsibility as your boss slash friend.",
        "It wasn\u2019t that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.",
        "Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I\u2019m done. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m out.",
        "People are always coming to me. \u201cMichael, I have a secret.  Your the only one I trust.\u201d No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend.  This movie, Portrait of a\u2026 Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call\u2026 More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to live like that. I like it here. I don\u2019t want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.",
        "Oh, Pam with the dirty talk.",
        "Oh!",
        "No, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that\u2019s much harder to do.",
        "No, no, no, no. I don\u2019t want to chip my mug. Please get that off the floor.",
        "All right. Jack Nicholson for birdie.",
        "It\u2019s a celebrity tournament.",
        "Do you see it?",
        "Do you feel it?",
        "God\u2026 damn it, Dwight! That\u2019s great.",
        "That won\u2019t be necessary.",
        "No, I am the King bee,",
        "No, King is higher. Then Ace. I am the Ace bee.",
        "Keep. I will finish that later.",
        "Yeah, I know when it\u2019s from, Ryan.",
        "Keep the change. Here you go buddy, happy birthday.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "No, no, no, no. I have the long sleeve. And actually, you know what we should do? We should wear them tomorrow to work, it\u2019ll be hysterical.",
        "Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You\u2019d better try it on, make sure it fits.",
        "Spamster!",
        "Hamster.",
        "Welcome back!  How was your vacation?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Did you get lucky?  Oh!  Boink!",
        "I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay.  Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!",
        "Wow!  What happened in there?",
        "There is stink in there, my God!  What is\u2026 what is that?",
        "Is it a bird?",
        "Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could\u2026 right in the middle of the carpet.",
        "Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.",
        "Check it out.",
        "Check it out.  Don\u2019t be a wuss, just get\u2026 no, I\u2019m not holding your coffee.",
        "What is it?",
        "What is it?  No, just tell me what it is.",
        "I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.",
        "How do you know that?  What is it, then?",
        "Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great.",
        "That is worse.",
        "I am a big Fear Factor fan.  I\u2019m a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um\u2026    I can\u2019t stand it , I can\u2019t stay in here another second.  No!",
        "Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.",
        "Oh\u2026 It\u2019s \u2026",
        "Yeah \u2026",
        "No, no, no!  Seriously, I don\u2019t mind sharing.",
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Old bullpen.",
        "Don\u2019t ape me.",
        "This is great.",
        "The pressures of my office are insane.",
        "I just\u2026 you couldn\u2019t understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ed Truck.   Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, \u201cOh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work.\u201d  What a jerk.  He\u2019s\u2026 You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.",
        "You know who used to sit at that desk?",
        "Mm-mm.  Todd Packer.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He was, but, uh\u2026 that desk was empty.  He\u2019d come in and sit there sometimes.",
        "When I was in training, many years ago\u2026 not so long ago\u2026 I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office .  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that <i>they</i> were crazy.",
        "I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.",
        "Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.  Okay.",
        "Another time, Packer held this guy\u2019s head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasn\u2019t hired.",
        "Charley horse!",
        "Charley horse!",
        "Oh, okay.  Gah.",
        "Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office.   It was hysterical.",
        "Dwight.",
        "Let\u2019s send up Accounting.",
        "Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead.",
        "Hey guys.",
        "Ahem.  What\u2019s up?",
        "Yeah! Oh ho ho",
        "No, no, no, no.  We don\u2019t do that.  We don\u2019t do that.",
        "Watch out, Pam. You\u2019re next!",
        "Maybe!",
        "Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?  I don\u2019t know.  It could be done out of hate.  It could be done out of love.  It could be completely neutral.  Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.  And, well, she doesn\u2019t do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.  I hate her.",
        "You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense.",
        "Stop.",
        "Stop it.  Stop.  It.   Don\u2019t.  Don\u2019t.",
        "All right.",
        "Hi, guys.",
        "I\u2019m just walking around.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "Oh, and I\u2019m not?  Why would you say that? Because I\u2019m having fun?  You guys just are workin\u2019 for the weekend, aren\u2019t you?  I\u2019m workin\u2019 for the week.  Sales team, listen to me.  This is what we\u2019re gonna do.  I\u2019m gonna up the ante a little bit literally.  Right here, I\u2019m gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.  Sound good?",
        "Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and I\u2019m going to \u2026  \u2026 I\u2019m gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jim\u2019s clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Let\u2019s see who winds up with the cash, shall we?",
        "Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!",
        "God, this is gonna be fun.",
        "So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring.  Very good, nice doing business with you.  Thank you.  Yes!  Oh, yeah!  Read it and weep.  Oh!  Oh, look at that!   Look at me, Phyllis!  Oh, what is that?  That\u2019s my sale!",
        "Nothing.",
        "No.  Just \u2026",
        "You know what, guys?  It\u2019s none of your concern.  It was official business, so just\u2026",
        "Yeah, paper business.  Is this done?",
        "Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.",
        "This was no act of God.  A person did this.  A person who works in this office.  Maybe all of them.",
        "You know what?  Today is not a good day for a sales contest.  We\u2019re\u2026 we\u2019re not\u2026 we\u2019re not doin\u2019 this today.",
        "You wanna talk about fair?  Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?  You explain to me how that was fair, and I\u2019ll explain to you how this is fair.  Plus I just\u2026 I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.",
        "I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about.",
        "Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I\u2026 you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we\u2019d be done .   Very well.  Then you are all punished.",
        "You\u2019re all on a time out.  Just sit there quietly.   No.  NO!",
        "Do you remember Ed Truck?",
        "How would I know?",
        "My biggest fear is turning into him.",
        "I wasn\u2019t talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you?",
        "Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin\u2019 back.",
        "Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don\u2019t wanna be up there right now.",
        "Oh, no, no, no.  You\u2019re good.  It was clerical.  You\u2019re good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.",
        "I didn\u2019t get a good look at\u2026 it, but it smells horrible.",
        "Really?",
        "Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?",
        "Well\u2026 s-sure I can.",
        "Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father.",
        "Well, okay.  Different management styles.",
        "Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.  I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.  But now, no.  I don\u2019t have the relationship with these people that I thought I did.  I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, \u201cUh\u2026 no. I only give my organs to my real friends.  Go get yourself a monkey kidney.\u201d",
        "Yes.",
        "Who is this?  How did you get this number?",
        "Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin\u2019?",
        "Uh\u2026 no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it?",
        "Really?",
        "Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it?",
        "Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?",
        "Are you kidding me?  Oh!",
        "That was Packer!  Oh, you\u2019re\u2026 you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar\u2026 Oh, God!  Of course it was you.",
        "Oh.   Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer!",
        "It takes an advanced sense of humor.  I don\u2019t expect everybody to understand.  It was done out of love, just like I thought.  It\u2019s ah\u2026 God, these people are so\u2026 these are good people.  We have fun.  We just have fun!  Oh, I\u2019m just so sorry that I threw the thing out.",
        "What\u2019s going on? Anything here?",
        "Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or\u2026",
        "Ah. Small?",
        "Huge?",
        "Would you say the sale that I made earlier was huge or\u2026",
        "What was that?",
        "You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you?",
        "Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?",
        "No, I did not.",
        "Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.",
        "Do you know a joke?",
        "Call a client right now.",
        "And tell him the joke.",
        "Strike while the iron\u2019s hot. A joke always works.",
        "Just sell it.",
        "Give me the phone.",
        "Give me the phone.",
        "Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.",
        "The old one two. Let\u2019s do it.",
        "Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he\u2019s a little\u2026 Little dim. He\u2019s the janitor\u2019s brother, so\u2026",
        "Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can\u2019t even find their way to work? That is Dwight.",
        "What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.",
        "Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I\u2019m glad it timed out that way.",
        "Hey, what\u2019s going on?",
        "Yeah\u2026 I\u2026 You know what\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.",
        "Hold\u2026 Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today\u2019s woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads\u2026",
        "No, just uh\u2026 you have come a long way, baby.  But I just\u2026 just want to keep it within reason.",
        "They did this up in Albany\u2026",
        "And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so\u2026",
        "Well, I\u2019m their boss, so I feel like\u2026",
        "Anybody want any coffee or\u2026",
        "Women in the workplace\u2026 yeah, translation \u201cI have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.\u201d Oh! Sorry. \u2018Women of the workplace.\u2019 About what? I don\u2019t know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!",
        "Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You\u2019re a guy\u2026 too\u2026 sort of. Let\u2019s do this!",
        "Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let\u2019s just clap.",
        "Let\u2019s just clap. Ready?  Yeah! Yeah!",
        "That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!",
        "Just having a little \u2018guys in the workplace\u2019 thing.",
        "Why can\u2019t boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?",
        "We have nowhere else Jan. This\u2026",
        "OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There\u2019s another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there\u2019s another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man\u2019s work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.",
        "Oh, I think it\u2019s going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven\u2019t been there in months.",
        "So let\u2019s meet the warehouse! Let\u2019s get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?",
        "You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There\u2019s Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And\u2026 uh, she\u2019s our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.",
        "Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina\u2026 Roy\u2026",
        "Roy and Pam. It\u2019s a Ram. It\u2019s a Ram thing.",
        "Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there\u2019s someone down here who shouldn\u2019t be. A little \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don\u2019t see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.",
        "Oh\u2026 well\u2026 okay\u2026 yeah, you know what? I don\u2019t think\u2026 You.. You\u2019re\u2026 My job sucks compared to this. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d like it up there.",
        "Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?",
        "Check this out! Look at that! Look at that  bwup-bwa!  Hello! How are\u2026  Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.",
        "Hey, you\u2019re going to, going to hurt yourself.",
        "Stand clear.",
        "I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine.",
        "Oh, oh, oh!  We\u2019ll get somebody to clean that up.",
        "We ought to have this thing serviced.",
        "So! Guy\u2019s gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That\u2019s going to happen, you know. We\u2019re guys, so\u2026",
        "No, why? Why would I\u2026 ? You could\u2026",
        "Stay or\u2026",
        "Let\u2019s start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?",
        "OK.",
        "OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh\u2026",
        "I\u2026 That was just\u2026",
        "I was breathing.",
        "I hate shushing. You know, that\u2019s the thing! What the\u2026 ok\u2026 what is our beef as human men.",
        "OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That\u2019s what guys do\u2026 and we love it.",
        "I feel you.",
        "Yes.",
        "Ah, you do. So\u2026",
        "I know. God! What is that?",
        "It blows. It blows, man. Gah\u2026",
        "No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.",
        "You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union\u2026 of guys.",
        "Dockworker\u2019s?",
        "Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.",
        "The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.",
        "Yeah-es.",
        "This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna\u2026 Can I help you? Um\u2026 I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points\u2026",
        "Don\u2019t get hysterical.",
        "Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.",
        "Let\u2019s\u2026 be\u2026 rational\u2026 here. What are the pros? What are the cons?",
        "Don\u2019t talk to me that way please. Just\u2026 they\u2019re going to want to hear this from you.",
        "But we\u2019re bonding down there!",
        "I mean I just don\u2019t want to have to tell them something they\u2019re not going to want to hear.",
        "Ok. Come on Jan. After all we\u2019ve been through\u2026",
        "We have a history\u2026",
        "\u2026between us.",
        "I won\u2019t",
        "I\u2019m just saying we have something\u2026 Ok. Whatever.",
        "Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?",
        "Hi.",
        "Yuh, yuh, yes! I\u2026 I have essentially\u2026",
        "I have essentially. Yes. I\u2019ve taken some\u2026",
        "I\u2019m just going to put this over there.",
        "You did uh\u2026 okay.",
        "Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?",
        "Hey. Um\u2026 look guys, I\u2019m sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.",
        "Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.",
        "Thank you to our hosts.",
        "Ahhh! Excellent.",
        "Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.",
        "And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I\u2019m a little overwhelmed.",
        "There\u2019s a lot of choices. You got to help me here.",
        "Which one of these is coolest? What do you think?",
        "No, no.",
        "Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, \u201cI am so lame.\u201d Know which one I want? There\u2019s one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It\u2019s like\u2026  You know what I\u2019m talking about?",
        "What are you guys talking about?",
        "Cool.",
        "Working on it.",
        "Yup.",
        "And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I\u2019m a little overwhelmed.",
        "There\u2019s a lot of choices. You got to help me here.",
        "Which one of these is coolest? What do you think?",
        "No, no.",
        "Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, \u201cI am so lame.\u201d Know which one I want? There\u2019s one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It\u2019s like\u2026  You know what I\u2019m talking about?",
        "Yes.",
        "What are you guys talking about?",
        "Cool.",
        "Working on it.",
        "Yup.",
        "All right.",
        "Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today.  Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.",
        "Nope. The opposite of that.",
        "Ok, good.",
        "I probably will, why do you ask?",
        "Yeah.",
        "<i>What</i> is your problem?",
        "This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine\u2019s Day. It\u2019s New York. City of Love.",
        "Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?",
        "Alright.",
        "Dude, I\u2019m gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!",
        "Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.",
        "The meeting isn\u2019t \u2019til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I\u2019m gonna go get me a New York slice.",
        "Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you\u2019re in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that\u2019s pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat.  We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.",
        "Everybody takes the subway in New York. It\u2019s fast, it\u2019s efficient, gets you there on time. It\u2019s a way to  Okay, there\u2019s a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.",
        "This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it\u2019s, that\u2019s Tina Fey . That\u2019s Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi?  OH, I\u2019m sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey.  Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn\u2019t. So\u2026 Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.",
        "I would love to live in New York someday. It\u2019s a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It\u2019d be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.  OK, umm, I think, that\u2019s either the Hudson or the East, so we\u2019re back,  should be back this way. There\u2019s a lotta pressure on me right now. It\u2019s like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin\u2019 Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it\u2019s over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let\u2019s do it.",
        "There they are. What\u2019s up? Hey hey.",
        "Josh Porter, high five.  Bam.",
        "Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers.",
        "You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?",
        "So what\u2019s going on? What I miss?",
        "Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and\u2026",
        "Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that\u2019s not. Cool it.",
        "Maybe because she\u2019s my girlfriend.  Was, or not my girlfriend. She\u2019s\u2026 we hooked up and\u2026",
        "You know, months ago, just once, It\u2019s, just stupid. Just forget it,",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Ditto.  How are you Jan?",
        "What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more.",
        "Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that\u2019s the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we\u2019re not just in the paper business, we\u2019re in the people business. Let\u2019s meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special.  This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley\u2019s dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark\u2019s of the foundation of the business we\u2019re hoping to build our bases on.",
        "Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won\u2019t. You know, not what this is about.",
        "And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it\u2019s like to walk a mile in Oscar\u2019s shoes. Or try on Phyllis\u2019 pants.  Maybe even one of Angela\u2019s famous brownies. And you\u2019ll know, that you\u2019re home.",
        "Questions?",
        "Yes, thank you.",
        "Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm\u2026",
        "Oh, ok. Alright.",
        "No you\u2019re not.",
        "Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So\u2026",
        "Yes. I\u2019m sorry. I will fix this. I\u2019ll talk to him. I\u2019ll talk to David.",
        "I am serious. And don\u2019t call me Shirley. Airplane.",
        "No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here\u2019s the deal. It\u2019s my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously.",
        "I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he\u2019s not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool.",
        "I know. It was borderline at best and\u2026 And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I\u2019m really sorry. It will never happen again.",
        "Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.",
        "Yeah, Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.",
        "Oy vey\u2026 schmear.",
        "I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.",
        "I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman\u2019s body? The brains. Because I don\u2019t think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.",
        "Great. Thank you.",
        "Okay, here\u2019s the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, \u201cOh there\u2019s nothing between us and stop talking about it.\u201d And \u201cBorder-line harassment when you call me at home.\u201d But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine\u2019s Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.",
        "You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.",
        "Let\u2019s think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then\u2026",
        "Could go either way. We don\u2019t know what they are going to say.",
        "Have to think it through. Because if they say no\u2026",
        "No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don\u2019t like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long.  Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh!  Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.",
        "Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys\u2026 Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.",
        "Hey, Dwight.",
        "You all right Ryan?",
        "Pam!",
        "That\u2019s what she said!",
        "Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?",
        "Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um\u2026 And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.",
        "Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just\u2026 I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you\u2019re awesome! Here\u2019s a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here\u2019s a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.",
        "That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.",
        "That\u2019s because you\u2019re incapable of doing it because you don\u2019t know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there\u2019s no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.",
        "But I can teach you enough so that you don\u2019t embarrass me or the company.",
        "Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.",
        "Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t try and think of a question to humor me. Just\u2026 try not to be such an idiot.",
        "Insult.",
        "But seriously, what\u2019s the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",
        "It\u2019s a joke, Dwight. It\u2019s not a Sex Ed class.",
        "Yeah, you\u2019re right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?  The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman\u2026 is boobs!",
        "I do. Both of them.",
        "No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn\u2019t matter what you say. It just matters that you\u2019re saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.",
        "Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!",
        "Congratulations.",
        "You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.",
        "No, no! It\u2019s not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They\u2019ll eat it up. They\u2019re a great audience.",
        "He\u2019s kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don\u2019t know why because it wasn\u2019t funny\u2026 and it was just horrible.",
        "Yeah.",
        "All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s do it.",
        "As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can\u2026 and did\u2026 twice.  You saw the plaque, right?  All right. We\u2019re all going to go around the room and we\u2019re going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.",
        "Pam! I\u2019m public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.",
        "Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.",
        "Oh ho hokay. You know what? That\u2019s not a toast. You\u2019re not standing up.",
        "Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.",
        "Well, it\u2019s mostly made up. So\u2026",
        "Dwight is not going to do a job. It\u2019s sad. And they\u2019re expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.",
        "Confidence, Dwight.",
        "It\u2019s time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.",
        "All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It\u2019s a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We\u2019re down here. Right.",
        "Dwight, they called your name.",
        "All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I\u2019m going to cover for you.  All right!",
        "Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",
        "I\u2019m very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. \u2026And now the black guy from the \u2018Police Academy\u2019 movies. A robot.  Michael Winslow, anyone?",
        "Car starting.   All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.",
        "Good luck. That is a tough crowd.",
        "I got thirsty. How\u2019d it go?",
        "You would not believe what happened here.",
        "Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.",
        "Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like \u2018I don\u2019t have my ID, please give me one.\u2019 And he was like \u2018I can\u2019t do that. I can\u2019t serve you.\u2019",
        "She might have been. So she says \u2018Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I\u2019ll show you my ID.\u2019 She hasn\u2019t come back yet. She\u2019s probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?",
        "Dwight gave a great speech. That\u2019s the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?",
        "That\u2019s it? You\u2019re going to end with \u201cetcetera\u201d? Okay, what\u2019s this big organizational system that\u2026",
        "That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.",
        "It\u2019s your delivery\u2026",
        "Our biggest worry.",
        "My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That\u2019s why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you.",
        "See, I have your attention now, don\u2019t I? You\u2019re scared, but now you\u2019re ready to learn.",
        "No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We\u2019ll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.",
        "All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.",
        "Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.",
        "Yeah, well, you know what? We need to\u2026 All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let\u2019s go.",
        "Anything your heart desires.",
        "Louder!",
        "Good. Good, good, good. That\u2019s good. Now see, that\u2019s not so hard, right? All right. Who\u2019s next? Who are we going to\u2026 Ryan. Ryan\u2019s next.",
        "Don\u2019t be shy, shy boy. Don\u2019t be shy. Get up there.",
        "Stop! Stop! Stop! That\u2019s, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It\u2019s certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so\u2026",
        "Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.",
        "Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.",
        "Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.",
        "You\u2019re weird.",
        "Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don\u2019t know. There we go.",
        "Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w\u2014",
        "\u2026 Oh, God is that today?",
        "Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid\u2019s environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I\u2019m going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in \u201cRaw,\u201d and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in \u201cDaddy Daycare.\u201d both great movies, but, still.",
        "Well, I\u2019ll be in my office.",
        "They\u2019re cool.",
        "Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I\u2019m Michael Scott, and\u2026 I\u2026 am in charge of this place\u2026 ahh, what\u2019ll make you\u2026 understand\u2026 I am\u2026 like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.",
        "Okay, I\u2019m Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?",
        "I work with a bunch of nerds.",
        "Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you\u2019ve really grown up. You know what? Don\u2019t mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the\u2026 frat boys away from her.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, middle school\u2019s amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.",
        "It\u2019s not that children make me uncomfortable, it\u2019s just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I\u2019ve never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.",
        "They want how many spiral pads?",
        "Okay.",
        "Just compare last year\u2019s order to this year\u2019s. Uh-huh. Yeah, I\u2019m looking at it right now.  \u2026 Yes. We\u2013yeah, they\u2019re very\u2013they\u2019re different.  Yeah, we can stick with last year\u2019s, you\u2019re just going to have to supplement it, somehow.",

        "Nice to meet you.",
        "Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I\u2019m the conductor.  But I\u2019m sort of the conductor of the office here, right?  You want to try?",
        "All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu\u2026camonga!",
        "Dwight! Dwight!",
        "What the hell are you reading to them?",
        "Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don\u2019t want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.",
        "What\u2019s a Nazi?",

        "Don\u2019t! Don\u2019t! Don\u2019t talk about Nazis in front of\u2014 you know what? They\u2019re going to have nightmares, so why don\u2019t you just shut it?",
        "Why don\u2019t you just leave? Okay?",
        "Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?",
        "Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool.",
        "This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these?  You know what that is? That\u2019s paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?",
        "No, we don\u2019t actually cut the paper. That\u2019s a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.",
        "Yes it is, well, w-w\u2013you need someone in the middle to facilitate\u2026",
        "I\u2019m not just a middle\u2026 man\u2026",
        "You are describing Office Depot, and they\u2019re kind of running us out of business.",
        "\u2026There\u2019s Creed! Let\u2019s take a look at what he\u2019s doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of\u2026 something. Right?",

        "You know, there\u2019s something interesting about me you might want to know. I \u2026 used to be \u2026 the star of a kids show.",
        "It\u2019s true. I did.",
        "I am totally serious. There was a show called \u2018Fundle Bundle\u2019 and I was the star.",
        "It\u2019s true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this.  Ryan, can you come here a second?  I would like you to go to my mother\u2019s house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled \u2018Fundle Bundle\u2019. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.",
        "I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?",

        "Alright, nowwww\u2026 what kind\u2026 of pizza do you like?",
        "I don\u2019t get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives\u2026 They\u2019re adults, for God\u2019s sake.",
        "I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called \u2018Fundle Bundle.\u2019 Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?",
        "That\u2026 is Miss Trudy. Can\u2019t tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can\u2026 fast forward. And\u2026 I want you\u2026 to\u2026",

        "Thank you.",
        "You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.",
        "Well, sure, playing the field is great, don\u2019t get me wrong, but there\u2019s more to life than notches just on my bedpost.",
        "Tell me something honestly, do you\u2026 think\u2026 that it is too late for me to have kids?",
        "What about\u2026",
        "\u2026Jan. Kay.",
        "\u2026Or biologically.",
        "Thanks, that\u2019s, no, that\u2026 that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I\u2026",
        "Oh\u2026 kay.",

        "Hey, uh, no, please? You can\u2019t leave yet. There\u2019s still one more thing we need to do.",
        "You\u2026 who are on the road\u2026 must have a code\u2026 that you can live by\u2026  and so\u2026 become yourself\u2026 because the past\u2026 is just a goodbye\u2026 and teach\u2026 your children well\u2026",

        "Sure.",
        "Okay. There you go.",
        "So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.",
        "Don\u2019t worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are\u2026 the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.",
        "You know what? That\u2019s a nice attitude, Ryan, I\u2019m just helping you invest in your future, my friend.",
        "Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!",
        "You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? \u2026Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich.  Alright.",
        "Alright, let me explain. Again.  Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we\u2019re all going to make. It\u2019s not a pyramid scheme, it is a\u2026 it\u2019s not even a scheme per se, it\u2019s\u2026  \u2026 I have to go make a call.",
        "Oh ho ho! What?",
        "Thank you! That\u2019s really nice.",

        "Don\u2019t! Nope! Please, don\u2019t want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.",
        "Let\u2019s get the party started.  Not the way I taught you!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, great, put her through.",
        "Hey, you.",
        "It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.",
        "Really? \u2018Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.",

And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.",
        "Stop it. Stop! What is that?",
        "Yeah, well, it\u2019s on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.",
        "You\u2019re making it worse. I bet Luke Perry\u2019s friends don\u2019t treat him like this .",
        "What?",

        "Mm-kay. Get whatever you want.  And choke on it.",
        "When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn\u2019t even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So\u2026 <i>That</i> was the worst birthday I think I ever had.",
        "Kevin? Respect the birthday please.",
        "Are you done? \u2026Good. Okay.",
        "Uhhh\u2026 blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm\u2026",
        "\u2026 I asked for trick candles.",

        "There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.",
        "Yeah, but it\u2019s not brain cancer. And it shouldn\u2019t stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.",
        "And laughter\u2026 also.",
        "Why are you here? I didn\u2019t even invite you to my birthday party.",
        "Nyeh, I work here.  Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn\u2019t speak for everybody and I am your boss, I\u2026 think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.",
        "Well, you\u2019re pretty much driving everyone else here crazy\u2026 crazy with worry.",
        "Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we\u2019re going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.",
        "How dare you sir. You are gross.",
        "That should not be there.",
        "No, it\u2019s alright. It\u2019s already up. Just leave it. Where\u2019s Kevin? Come on! Let\u2019s get our skate on!",
        "Yeah, I\u2019ve been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you\u2019re on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.",
        "Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin\u2026 um, it\u2019s pretty scary. And I\u2019m thinking that uh, next time you\u2019re in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.",
        "Kevin. You heard anything yet?",
        "Okay. Well. Live strong.",
        "Alright.",
        "Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or\u2026",
        "Oh, these\u2026 all your kids?",

        "Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would\u2026 be\u2026 chaos.",
        "Okay, who\u2019s this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!",
        "Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.",

        "Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don\u2019t know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I\u2019m sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.",
        "Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.",
        "I can do that, it is my office.",
        "Hmmm. Ha.  Alright. Great.",
        "It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.",
        "No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, \u201cHey, you know what, he\u2019s right? What he\u2019s doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.\u201d",
        "I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.",
        "Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn\u2019t smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.",
        "Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",
        "Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?",
        "Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?",
        "Yes it is.",
        "Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down?  In addition to Toby\u2019s urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.",
        "I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.",
        "Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I\u2019m going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.",
        "Really?",
        "Jim it\u2019s okay. You can t\u2026  This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you.  It\u2019s okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you.  Oh, he\u2019s doing it, okay.  It\u2019s okay.  Oh. Okay, are you sure?  That looked like it was going to be good. Alright.  Okay, well.",
        "The point I\u2019m trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don\u2019t quite hate \u2019em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.",
        "Yes, I will not be.",
        "Okay, well Dwight just know that I\u2019ve been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn\u2019t planning on going to the bathroom and I don\u2019t even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.",
        "So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.",
        "Just forget it.  Just the urine.",
        "Just. I need your urine.",
        "Yes in a cup, we\u2019re not animals, Dwight.",
        "It\u2019s none of your business.",
        "Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.",
        "I need clean urine for the lady.",
        "Don\u2019t think of it that way. It\u2019s like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there\u2019s no controlling it. It just\u2026 goes",
        "A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.",
        "No, just look. Look. Just\u2026 just fill up the cup.",
        "Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.",
        "What\u2019s wrong? Where\u2019s your costume?",
        "Why?  Wha\u2026",
        "Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I\u2019ve decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "So you wanna? Thanks.",
        "Okay.",
        "Good.",
        "No. Oh. Uh\u2026",
        "Alright.  Well, Thank you.",
        "Exactly. I know. It\u2019s amazing.",
        "Shut\u2026 Shut it. No. Just\u2026 Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.",
        "No, no! Your instinct. That\u2026 Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don\u2019t! That\u2019s, that\u2019s\u2026 Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.",
        "No? okay, fine.",
        "Okay, well, I really think that\u2026",
        "Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers\u2019 quarrel.",
        "Okay, let\u2019s get personal for a second, shall we?",
        "Well\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t\u2026 Let\u2019s just not talk about it, okay?",
        "Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam\u2019s. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We\u2019re doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.",
        "That\u2019s a nice tie.",
        "That is\u2026 who makes that?",
        "Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?",
        "What\u2019s the dealio?",
        "What\u2019s the problem?",
        "So what, you\u2019re having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Okay.",
        "What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So\u2026",
        "Okay\u2026 what?",
        "Yeah, well\u2026 that\u2019s not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part\u2026 assuming we don\u2019t get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?",
        "A mediator\u2019s tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.",
        "No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.",
        "Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You\u2026 you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",
        "Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.",
        "Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using \u201cI\u201d emotion language and no judging or \u201cyou\u201d statements.",
        "Come on, seriously, that?",
        "Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let\u2019s see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.",
        "Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.",
        "Okay\u2026 well, brainstorm. Own the solution.",
        "Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win \u2013 make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose \u2013 take the poster down, compromise \u2013 Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is\u2026 make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.",
        "It is done!",
        "Yes.",
        "Are those all the other complains?",
        "I would like to see those please.",
        "You can\u2019t do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.",
        "Okay.  There! No more conflict.  I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty.  All right\u2026 is that it?",
        "Ohh\u2026 God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?",
        "This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed\u2026 huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.",
        "You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.",
        "How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee?  And\u2026 did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?  That is outrageous! I love this place\u2026 and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering\u2026  Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?",
        "That\u2019s what she said.  The thing is, Angela\u2026 you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does \u201credacted\u201d mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked \u201credacted\u201d\u2026 ?",
        "Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.",
        "All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let\u2019s do it! And \u2026 okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.",
        "Uh\u2026 \u201dDoes she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn\u2019t she do that at home?\u201d  Who else? Why don\u2019t we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?",
        "Here is a Kelly complaint: \u201cRyan never returns my calls.\u201d Ugh, join the club.",
        "Makin\u2019 progress.  Yes?",
        "What?!",
        "Stanley.",
        "You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.",
        "Someone complained that the men\u2019s room is \u201cwhites only\u201d. Stanley, you know that\u2019s not true.",
        "Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela\u2019s giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.",
        "And\u2026 also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",
        "Oh\u2026 ok.",
        "Okay, well\u2026 all settled, then.",
        "OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?",
        "All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.",
        "Uh. Dwight.",
        "Okay! Calm down.",
        "Hey, hey!",
        "Stop.",
        "Okay\u2026",
        "Dwight\u2026",
        "Stop\u2026",
        "Oh\u2026 kay\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "Yes.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You know your I.D. says you\u2019re a security threat?",
        "Okay\u2026 you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!",
        "Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn\u2019t work, everybody would still be in the cage.",
        "Okay, so Dwight, in your own words \u2013  \u201cSomeone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.\u201d  \u201cEveryone has called me \u2018Dwayne\u2019 all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.\u201d",
        "\u201cThis morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.\u201d  \u201cJim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman\u2019s room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.\u201d  Gah. \u201cThis morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.\u201d",
        "\u201cEvery time I typed my name, it said \u2018Diapers\u2019.\u201d",
        "\u201cBy the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.\u201d",
        "The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I\u2019ve never had one. They sound awful.",
        "Hey, there\u2019s like, 300 more of these. Let\u2019s get to them later.",
        "Maybe, I haven\u2019t decided yet. Let\u2019s get to work.",
        "Okay. Oh\u2026 actually, tomorrow\u2019s not good. How about later in the week?",
        "Good. Okay.",
        "Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you\u2019re here?",
        "Well\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 what, a computer camera, right?",
        "It\u2019ll take like two seconds.",
        "Ugh\u2026 All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter.",
        "Come on, everybody.",
        "We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.",
        "Good, let\u2019s check that out.  Ew, okay, all right. One more. We\u2019ll take one more.",
        "What?",
        "You just press the button.",
        "Okay, good. Check that out.",
        "That\u2019s terrible.",
        "Let\u2019s pay Mr. Price Gouger.  Okay\u2026 we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go.",
        "It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.",
        "One, two.. Didn\u2019t say three, did I?",
        "But, I\u2019m sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can\u2019t outrun your problems.",
        "And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here\u2019s the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.",
        "On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.",
        "Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it\u2019s illegal in Pennsylvania, but it\u2019s for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, \u201cMichael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.\u201d Makes you feel good.",
        "I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It\u2019s more of a David-and-Goliath thing.",
        "Top 80 percent!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!",
        "Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we\u2019re having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.",
        "I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.",
        "Oh, come on. Come on.",
        "You know, it\u2019d be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.",
        "Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we\u2019ve remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.",
        "Okay, everybody. Tonight\u2019s event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.",
        "Well, they need our money. They don\u2019t have cookies like the Girl Scouts.",
        "Well, Oscar, if you don\u2019t like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.",
        "So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.",
        "Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.",
        "Well, then, they need our money more than ever.",
        "Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We\u2019re gonna\u2026",
        "Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not\u2026 that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn\u2019t exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.",
        "No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.",
        "What?",
        "That\u2019s a dog.",
        "That\u2019s a shawl.",
        "No. Humans with AIDS.",
        "Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.",
        "There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. \u201cI need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.\u201d  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It\u2019s one of my dreams.",
        "I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?",
        "It\u2019s Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.",
        "Well, actually, it\u2019s my warehouse.",
        "Why are you here?",
        "Not. I said, not that.",
        "That\u2019s ironic.",
        "That you are afraid.",
        "Dinkin\u2019 flicka.",
        "Give me some.",
        "Yes",
        "Who?",
        "Do I know a Carol Stills?",
        "Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it <i>real</i> good?",
        "Hi, Carol. How you doing?",
        "Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.",
        "Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It\u2019s okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.",
        "Actually, I\u2019m sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.",
        "Yeah, it\u2019ll be good. You know what? Why don\u2019t you come by? Bring the papers, I\u2019ll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.",
        "Yeah. It\u2019ll be fun. What do you\u2026 What do you\u2026",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?",
        "Okay, put her through.  Jan Levinson, I presume?",
        "Hey, Jan. How you doing?",
        "I am?",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "AIDS.",
        "Okay, sounds great.",
        "Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just\u2026",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah?",
        "What?",
        "Okay.",
        "Problem. Good.",
        "Good, All right. Sounds great.",
        "Bye.",
        "Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.",
        "Hey, hey.",
        "Hey, Carol.",
        "You look great.",
        "Oh, well\u2026 Kiss.  That\u2019s how we do it in the paper biz. It\u2019s European and\u2026 Yes? Ah, Dwight",
        "Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.",
        "Okay.",
        "Billy, your nurse is hot.",
        "Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.",
        "Chili\u2019s is great.",
        "Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.",
        "Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let\u2019s get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.",
        "All-in.",
        "Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I\u2019m not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?",
        "What are\u2026 That\u2019s insane.",
        "Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn\u2019t that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don\u2019t be stupid. Just take it back.",
        "Okay, all right, whatever.",
        "You really screwed that up.",
        "Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren\u2019t involved, I would always be winning.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",
        "Jan.",
        "Look, okay, I think we\u2019re all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.",
        "After you said you weren\u2019t coming, I invited Carol to come and I don\u2019t think that I did anything wrong.",
        "Um\u2026",
        "Hey. What\u2026",
        "All right!",
        "Four!  Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites.  All right, here we go!",
        "Yeah!",
        "So close. So close.",
        "Hey, okay.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Okay. Thanks for coming.",
        "Okay. Talk to you Monday.",
        "Good night. She\u2019s a good boss.",
        "Oh, she\u2019s great.",
        "Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I\u2019ve got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.",
        "Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun.",
        "How about a location?",
        "Where the hell is that?",
        "Okay, all right.",
        "No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.",
        "We already have that. So\u2026",
        "No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey\u2019s good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.",
        "Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn\u2019t so hard. All right, here we go. \u201cOffice Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.\u201d",
        "\u201cOne of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an\u2026\u201d Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we\u2019re\u2026 Okay, we\u2019re starting over.",
        "Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.",
        "Paper money.  Yeah. The company\u2019s doing fine.",
        "Hey. Okay. You know what? Don\u2019t even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don\u2019t think about it.",
        "Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that\u2019s really more than half the battle.",
        "No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody \u201cfaggie\u201d. Why would anybody find that offensive?",
        "That\u2019s what faggie means!",
        "It wasn\u2019t just an action movie, it was Die Hard!",
        "Exactly!",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "OK, a little too far, crossed the line.",
        "I would have never called him that if I knew.  You don\u2019t\u2026 You don\u2019t call retarded people \u201cretards\u201d.  It\u2019s bad taste.  You call your friends \u201cretards\u201d when they\u2019re acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend.",
        "Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.",
        "No.  No it\u2019s not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people \u201cfaggie\u201d since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don\u2019t know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I\u2019m just\u2026 I, I can\u2019t even imagine\u2026 the\u2026 thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me\u2026 how\u2026 you do that to another dude.",
        "Can you tell who\u2019s gay and who\u2019s not?",
        "What about Oscar?",
        "Well, he <i>is</i>.",
        "There could be others\u2026  I need to know.  I don\u2019t want to offend anybody else.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.",
        "Hey, what about Angela?   She\u2019s hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman.",
        "I don\u2019t know, I can imagine her with another woman, can\u2019t you?",
        "Do some research.  Find out if there\u2019s a way to tell by just looking at them.",
        "That\u2019s ridiculous.",
        "Let\u2019s call him and get the website.",
        "Well, they\u2019re sold out.",
        "I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so\u2026",
        "What?  What does that even\u2026",
        "Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It\u2019s not like gay\u2026 shame festival.",
        "I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?",
        "I don\u2019t kn\u2013",
        "Anything\u2019s possible.",
        "Well, I\u2019m not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!",
        "The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.",
        "Trick question!  Cause you can\u2019t always tell, so\u2026 how would I know.  Is that the right answer?",
        "Nothing wrong with this stuff.  At all.  This is fine.  You know what.  Gay porn, straight porn, it\u2019s all goooooood!  I don\u2019t particularly get into this.  But uh, you know what.  I totally see the merit!  And actually\u2026 it is quite beautiful.",
        "All right, everybody in the conference room!  I don\u2019t care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!  JUST GET IN HERE!  RIGHT NOW!",
        "Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love\u2026 to other men.",
        "We\u2019re all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays aren\u2019t necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or\u2026 accountants.  Oscar, why don\u2019t you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  I\u2019m doing this for you.",
        "Who should be the judges and juries of our society?",
        "Yes, that\u2019s a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?",
        "That\u2019s great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!   See?  Everybody has a chance!",
        "But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do!",
        "Right!   And I take that as a compliment.",
        "Well, I just like to look good OK, so \u2014",
        "No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!",
        "No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is: <i>Gay, good</i>.",
        "Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just\u2026 I would be waving that rainbow flag.",
        "You misunderstand\u2013 OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, I\u2019m gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you can\u2019t catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend \u2014",
        "\u2026and I just don\u2019t care who sees it, doesn\u2019t bother me!",
        "All right, um\u2026 sorry.",
        "I\u2019m sorry I called you faggie.  You\u2019re not faggie.  You\u2019re a a good guy.",
        "You know what, I\u2019m going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.    I did it.  See.  I\u2019m still here.  We\u2019re all still here.",
        "Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!",
        "We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we can\u2019t lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love\u2026  anyway?  Maybe it\u2019s supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar\u2026 and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?",
        "I am glad that today spurred social change.  That\u2019s part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didn\u2019t, at least we put this matter to bed.  \u2026that\u2019s what she said.  Or he said.",
        "Oh, there\u2019s Gill.  Oscar\u2019s roommate.  I wonder if he knows?",
        "I will do my job to the best of my abilities.",
        "I will do my <i>regional manager</i> job to the best of my <i>cap</i>ability.",
        "Specifically, Jan, I will make at least ten phone calls to clients.",
        "Yes, I have to begin every day by letting Jan know what I intend to accomplish, and then I have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what I <i>did</i> accomplish. But it\u2019s not mandatory. It\u2019s something that I\u2026 wanted to do\u2026 and so it\u2019s voluntary, really. Even though she\u2026 makes me. I think she just wants to hear my voice. Because we\u2019re no longer lovers, and she\u2019s just hurting. But things are going well with Carol. I\u2019ve seen her seven times in the last few months, and I\u2019m growing very fond of her kids. Tommy, who I call Tomas, and the little girl\u2026",

        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, good. By yourself?",
        "Aw. Well, hang in there, okay?  You know what? You should get one of this big body pillows. That way you wouldn\u2019t miss you-know-who so much.",

        "Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.",
        "I know.",
        "Well\u2026",
        "Just do it, okay?",
        "Um\u2026 find out if there\u2019s a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?",
        "Eight months?",

        "Right there. Ah.",
        "Per diem.",
        "Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He\u2019s been stuck working under Josh, the poor man\u2019s Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.",

        "Yeah, do it!",
        "Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?",
        "Um. Okay, um.",
        "You got that?",
        "Write it down.",

        "Hey hey!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, that\u2019s how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain\u2019t no party like a Scranton party, \u2019cause a Scranton party don\u2019t stop.",

        "Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.",
        "Okay! Excellent. Oh\u2026",
        "Shut it.  Hey, Pam, what\u2019s up? Yep, yech\u2026 no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes.  Say hi to Pam!",

        "Come on!",
        "Fine.",
        "Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it\u2019s talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it\u2019s moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I\u2019m done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.",

        "People have been filtering in and out.",
        "What?",
        "Sure. You like Cosmos?",
        "Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?",
        "I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales\u2026 I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that\u2019s just\u2026",
        "I\u2019m not better than Josh.",
        "Oh my God. You don\u2019t even know. She\u2019s single now.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I will. I\u2019ll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you\u2019re feeling.",

        "Best friends.",
        "Some people need dozens of friends to say, \u201cHey, look at me, I\u2019m popular.\u201d But not me. I\u2019m very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you\u2019ll just know. Because a real relationship, it\u2026 it can\u2019t be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.",
        "Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?  Ha, ha, ha.",

        "I know.  I told her I didn\u2019t know whether you\u2019d wanna do it\u2026 because you\u2019ve always been so loyal to me.  You\u2019ve been my most trusted ally.",
        "Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think\u2026 you should do it.",
        "Perfect, well, we\u2019re settled.",
        "All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I\u2026 am assistant regional manager.",
        "Ohh..",
        "Can\u2019t you?  That\u2019s so nice.",
        "Well\u2026 I guess we should go tell the troops.",
        "Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I\u2026 am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.",
        "You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.",
        "Because, Dwight\u2026 never lies.",
        "Because that\u2019s all it takes.",
        "Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody\u2026 about loyalty?",
        "Oh, I\u2019ll be fine.",
        "No, no, I don\u2019t, but\u2014",
        "I\u2026 won\u2019t.   I won\u2019t.",
        "Well, I guess it\u2019s time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.",
        "It\u2019s a corporate lease Dwight, you\u2019ve earned it.",
        "What?",
        "But you said you liked it.  You\u2019ve always admired it.",
        "Take it back.",
        "That\u2019s my car.",
        "THAT\u2019S MY CAR.",
        "I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.",
        "Jan called me about your little meeting!",
        "I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.",
        "Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring\u2014 HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?",
        "Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!",
        "Not.  Good.  Enough!",
        "I have a laundry machine!",
        "I don\u2019t know if I can trust you anymore.",
        "You can get up.  Get up.  And you can hug it out, bitch.",
        "Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just\u2026 let it go.  And walk away.  And they\u2019re done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn\u2019t translate.",
        "Yep.  Yeah, we hugged it out.  But, it turns out, I was still a little angry.  So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and I\u2019m making him do my laundry for a year.",
        "Okay.",
        "It is not your business, Dwight.",
        "What do you know about management, Dwight?",
        "I\u2019m not firing anyone.",
        "\u2026 What?",
        "Okay. Here we go. Everybody, you know what? It dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, Let\u2019s get back in there.  Come on. Movie Monday! Come on, Stanley let\u2019s go.",
        "Ryan?",
        "Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.",
        "So, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the McDreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he\u2019s in love with her\u2026",
        "Really?",
        "Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?",
        "Oh, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m going down.",
        "All right, I\u2019ll be right back.",
        "There you go.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "Don\u2019t mind if I do.  See you in a minute.",
        "There you go, fresh from the warehouse.",
        "There\u2019s coffee in the kitchen, Pam.",
        "All right.  Okay.",
        "I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained.",
        "All right.",
        "Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me?",
        "Oh, wow.",
        "Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died.",
        "Yes, I am.  It\u2019s very sad.  Because he was my boss.",
        "That\u2019s right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I\u2019ll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.",
        "So did you hear the news?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It\u2019s\u2026 pssssh\u2026 .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.",
        "",
        "Yeah.  Mmmmmm.",
        "Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin\u2019.",
        "The older you get, the bigger the chance is you\u2019re gonna die.  You knew that.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I\u2019m sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.",
        "So, I\u2019m not exactly sure how to say this\u2026",
        "What are you doing?",
        "I didn\u2019t\u2026 he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that\u2019s when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.",
        "I don\u2019t understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn\u2019t even work here.",
        "You really don\u2019t get it, do you?  You don\u2019t understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.",
        "A statue.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.",
        "We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move\u2026",
        "I think that is a great way to honor Ed.",
        "Life-size.",
        "Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.",
        "Mm hm.",
        "Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.",
        "But Ed truck can\u2019t because he is\u2014",
        "DEAD.",
        "That\u2019s perfect.",
        "Oohh\u2026 can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.",
        "What?",
        "Well, you know what?  I didn\u2019t wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can\u2019t stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he\u2019s on his way home\u2026 wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!",
        "Well, you know what?  There\u2019s something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don\u2019t wanna talk about it, you don\u2019t wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!",
        "There are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, they\u2019re all denying the fact that they\u2019re sad.  And that\u2019s   hard.  And it\u2019s making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I\u2019ll have done my job.",
        "I am going to throw you this ball.  When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.  Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And\u2026 it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears\u2026 and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer\u2026 and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone\u2026 and I\u2019m crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly\u2026 terribly alone.",
        "Okay, fine.  Hurry back.",
        "Okay, we can start.  Um\u2026",
        "Yeah.  Pam, you\u2019re a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?",
        "Okay, why don\u2019t you throw the ball to somebody else.",
        "Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.",
        "Okay\u2026 I\u2019m going to toss the ball to Pam.",
        "Wow.  If you wanna cry, that\u2019s okay.",
        "Do you want to talk about it anymore?",
        "Wait a second.  That\u2019s Weekend at Bernie\u2019s.  Do you think that this is a game?",
        "All right, we\u2019re starting over.",
        "You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.",
        "Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk.",
        "How do you know?",
        "That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?",
        "Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn\u2019t.  You\u2019re not a veterinarian.  You don\u2019t know ANYTHING!",
        "Oh, God!",
        "Oh my God!  Oh my God, come on \u2026",
        "Oh shhhh\u2013oot!",
        "No, he\u2019s not.",
        "No, he\u2019s not.",
        "Well, you can\u2019t get diseases from a bird!",
        "We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s dead.",
        "Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.",
        "Well, I\u2019m sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.",
        "No, no, no!  That\u2019s enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now.  Find a box for him.",
        "It\u2019s okay.  It\u2019s okay.  Shh\u2026 yes, I know, I know. It\u2019s been a tough day, but it\u2019s good to let it show.",
        "What are\u2026 What are you doing?",
        "No, God, no it\u2019s not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?",
        "Glad you could all make it.",
        "Dwight, do you have the box?",
        "You made this?  Wow.  That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s very nice.",
        "Yes.",
        "Shhh.",
        "Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that\u2019s baloney, because grief isn\u2019t wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.",
        "Oh, wow. He\u2026",
        "Does his family know?",
        "But I\u2019m the first in the office?",
        "Okay, yes, sure, I will do that\u2026",
        "\u2026\u2019Cause I\u2019m the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over?",
        "Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I\u2019ve had more time to be sad.",
        "I would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because I am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor. We need to find out what is blocking you. And that way, we\u2019ll be able to honor Ed the way he deserves to be honored. May he rest in peace.",
        "What was that, Kevin?",
        "No, you said something, didn\u2019t you?",
        "You think that\u2019s funny.",
        "You are disgusting.",
        "No, that can\u2019t be right.",
        "Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn\u2019t it?",
        "You\u2019re ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.",
        "Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I\u2019ve ever met.",
        "No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We\u2019re gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we\u2019re going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?",
        "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, \u201cAre you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?\u201d These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.",
        "Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can\u2019t grieve if you\u2019re all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said.",
        "I found an exercise in Toby\u2019s binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna do that. I don\u2019t wanna talk about that. That is too private.\u201d Here\u2019s how it works. I\u2019m going to throw you this ball.",
        "",
        "That\u2019s\u2026 Hold it, hold it, hold it. Start, like, right in there.  Just dig.",
        "Okay, give it to me. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. All right.",
        "Nothing. Let\u2019s just\u2026 all right.  Guys, do you have a box we could use?",
        "Uhhh\u2026 nothing.",
        "Yeah, nothing. How was your day?",
        "Wow. Well. Ok. I don\u2019t care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?",
        "I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?",
        "Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.",
        "Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.",
        "Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I\u2019m just going to have my soft pretzel, then I\u2019ll get to work, and I\u2019ll be super productive. Look out for me.",
        "Oh, shhh\u2026 Come on.",
        "Uh huh.",
        "Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?",
        "No, I think you\u2019re cutting in line.",
        "No, I\u2019m not going to settle down.",
        "Get in the back please.",
        "Boooooo. Thank you. . That\u2019s right.",
        "No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I\u2019d like to see. You read my mind.",
        "I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You\u2019re an angel.",
        "Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.",
        "Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I\u2019ll be back.",
        "Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.",
        "Thank God.",
        "Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?",
        "All right! Thank you!",
        "Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What\u2019s going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let\u2019s make a deal. So what is the deal?",
        "Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second\u2026",
        "Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.",
        "And I will be taking questions.",
        "Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I\u2019m going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we\u2019re getting a lot done, don\u2019t you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!",
        "Hey, what time is it?",
        "AM or PM?",
        "Oh, good.",
        "Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.",
        "Yes. Right. Good.",
        "Goodnight!",
        "Well, that\u2019s really not the way I roll, because sometimes I\u2019m in the zone, and sometimes I\u2019m in the zoning out.",
        "Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I\u2019ll do it.",
        "Yes, big if.",
        "A woman spurned.",
        "I always do.",

        "Would you look at that?   Damn it, Dwight! Come on.",
        "\u201c9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist. Met with Jan, RE: log. Lost log. Found log.\u201d \u201c10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points.\u201d That\u2019s on the wrong page.",
        "Okay. That sounds good.   Yes. Actually, today\u2019s a good day to do that.",
        "What makes them so good?",
        "I mean, they\u2019re just dough twisted up with some candy. They taste so good in my mouth.",
        "Nice dress, Ryan.",
        "OK.",
        "Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it  it\u2019s ada blah blah blah, it\u2019s so super fun and it\u2019s going to be great.  Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.",
        "How come you didn\u2019t get me one?",
        "Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do\u2026 sign me up\u2026 because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.",
        "It\u2019s important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.",
        "Wha? Really? You should! It\u2019s fun.",
        "I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di\u2026 don\u2019t really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don\u2019t want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.",
        "Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I\u2019m a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.",
        "Kelly?",
        "Um\u2026 why don\u2019t you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.",
        "All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn\u2019t \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019.",
        "Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians.  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. \u2018The Village\u2019, \u2018Unbreakable\u2019, \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019, \u2018Sig\u2026 \u2018",

        "And another thing about the Indian people\u2026 they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who\u2019s seen that before?",
        "Thank you, Kevin.",

        "No. This is delightful, charming culture.",
        "My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It\u2019s just sex. People\u2026 everybody does it. I\u2019m doing it\u2026 with Carol! Probably tonight.",
        "What does that look like to you?",
        "No one\u2019s even going to notice.",
        "Hey, Kevin. It\u2019s a costume. Why don\u2019t you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.",
        "I\u2019ll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions\u2026",

Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um\u2026 okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you\u2019re all thinking \u2018who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?\u2019 Well, I\u2019m not crazy. Maybe I\u2019m crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.",
        "What do you say?",
        "I didn\u2019t hear you.",

        "Yeah, well, but I \u2026 I feel like I\u2019ve known you many lifetimes. Maybe I\u2019m Hindu after all. Okay, I\u2019m not Hindu, but\u2026 Carol. Carol, I just\u2026 I feel like\u2026 I just like you so much.",
        "Yes.",

        "Oh. You waiting for a call?",
        "Wow. Pam. When Carol said \u2018No.\u2019 tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.",

Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it\u2019s time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it\u2019s not Christmas, it\u2019s Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don\u2019t invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali.

        "What is Diwali?",
        "You don\u2019t know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I\u2019m surprised. It\u2019s the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you\u2019d be familiar with it. It\u2019s the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It\u2019s like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween\u2014",

        "Hey, girls. What\u2019s happening? Startinng to blend? Well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are gonna share the same menstrual cycle.",
        "Can\u2019t we all get along?  No, we can\u2019t. But here\u2019s the thing: yes, we can. Well, why not? Because of differeneces. Well, can we overcome these differences?  No. Can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences? No, we can\u2019t. But, we have to try and that is why I created the Integration Celebration.",
        "I need somebody to pick a card.  One of the new people, please? Tony?",
        "All right. Good. Thank you.  Do not look at your card. Now, I\u2019ve always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here . So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card.",
        "So I think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be  a king of hearts.",
        "Dwight, don\u2019t, don\u2019t be a suck up.",
        "What I want all of you  to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them. Who wants to start? Who wants to give it a shot?",
        "Okay Meredith, let\u2019s give it a shot.",
        "Beautiful. Very good, nice.",
        "Okay.",
        "We heard it.",
        "We heard what you said. You didn\u2019t cover it at all.",

        "Hannah?",
        "Kuhhhh\u2026 you are such a racist.",
        "Because you think he\u2019s black.",
        "Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.",
        "Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy\u2026 who went to prison for\u2026 polluting a black guy\u2019s lake.",
        "In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and\u2026 saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.",
        "Sssssso, what we need to do\u2026 is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.",
        "Good. All right.",
        "Just\u2026 try to be cool.",
        "Okay, are you cool, really?",

        "Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I\u2026 trust\u2026 him, completely, and that anybody who doesn\u2019t is an ignorant, dumb\u2026 person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.",

        "Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What\u2019s he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants\u2026 he says something ordinary like\u2026 \u2018yo, thats shizzle.\u2019 Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.",
        "No. That\u2019s not cool. You don\u2019t have to tell them.",
        "That is awesome.",
        "Well, we are running a business, so.",
        "Ah. Well. That\u2019s not true.",
        "No you would not.",
        "This place is not prison. It\u2019s\u2026 way better than prison.",
        "Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let\u2019s go!",
        "Why don\u2019t we\u2026 pump some iron? Anyone wanna\u2026 pump up?",
        "It\u2019s uh\u2026 two and a half. I\u2019m not going for bulk, I\u2019m going for tone.",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s\u2026 freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you\u2019ve got about\u2026 twenty-seven minutes of rec time.",
        "Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?",
        "Ah. A ten inch black and white?",
        "These people don\u2019t realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.",
        "All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better\u2026 than\u2026 here. And none of can say \u201cBoo\u201d because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there\u2019s somebody I\u2019d like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . I\u2019m prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!",
        "Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that\u2019s just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody\u2019s bitch. Oh, and you.  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don\u2019t drop the soap! Don\u2019t drop the soap!",
        "Internet.",
        "And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.",
        "I stole. \u2026 And I robbed. And I kidnapped\u2026 the\u2026 president\u2019s son. And held him for ransom.",
        "And I nevah got caught, neither.",
        "Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.",
        "Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.",
        "The worst thing about prison was the\u2026 was the Dementors. They\u2026 were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they\u2019d come down, and they\u2019d suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!",
        "No, not Harry Potter. \u2026 There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who\u2026 have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody\u2019s bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. \u2018Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesn\u2019t sound so great, does it?",
        "Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go.",
        "No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it\u2019s like to have freedom. And if this doesn\u2019t bother them, then I am out of ideas.",
        "They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.",
        "Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don\u2019t you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!",
        "Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford\u2026 to a convict, to\u2026 my friend. Back to a convict. Then to\u2026 a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to\u2026 a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.",
        "Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la.  \u2018Tis the \u2026 ack.  Hey!  I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint\u2026",
        "I\u2019m looking for the toy drive box.",
        "OK\u2026  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it\u2019ll fit, with all these little knickknacks.",
        "Umm\u2026 I don\u2019t know? Average kind?",
        "Well, that is probably from the test drive.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, thanks.",
        "Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn\u2019t have to do that.",
        "OK. Did everybody get one of these?",
        "Terrific. Good.",
        "This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her.  I\u2019ve got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we\u2019re leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.",
        "There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello  You\u2019re about five hours early to the party. You\u2019re such a blonde.",
        "Hey, everybody. I don\u2019t know who you haven\u2019t met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend \u2013 Carol. This is just the front of her. Show \u2019em, show \u2019em the other side.",
        "Turn around, turn around. Come on.",
        "No, you get outta here.",
        "Yes.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp.",
        "That is my Christmas card. It\u2019s a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.",
        "I know.",
        "Right.",
        "Yes, but what you didn\u2019t realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart\u2026",
        "And next to your kids. What?",
        "I don\u2019t understand?",
        "OK",
        "No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you\u2019re not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaica\u2019s largest fresh water pool.",
        "I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.",
        "And it\u2019s all inclusive.",
        "Yes.",
        "No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.",
        "I\u2019d like everybody\u2019s attention. Christmas is canceled.",
        "Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year\u2019s.",
        "Jim, take New Year\u2019s away from Stanley.",
        "Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don\u2019t think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.",
        "Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests.",
        "Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.",
        "Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.",
        "It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.",
        "Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?",
        "Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?",
        "And not that you didn\u2019t want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I\u2019m referring to?",
        "Take it from Toby.",
        "Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?",
        "It\u2019s all\u2026  OK.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Carol?",
        "I don\u2019t have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just\u2026 I just want a little taste of it.",
        "Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.",
        "This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.",
        "All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.",
        "Hooters?",
        "Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C\u2019mon, we\u2019re going to Asian Hooters.",
        "Why not?",
        "Ok, feel better.",
        "C\u2019mon Jim, let\u2019s go.",
        "Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then \u2026 and then suddenly she\u2019s not yo\u2019 ho no mo\u2019.",
        "Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They\u2019re on a date. They look very happy.",
        "Carol used to drink lattes.",
        "She would get this little foam mustache\u2026",
        "And I used to say \u201cHey, got latte?\u201d And she\u2019d say, that\u2019s not funny.",
        "She totally got me. She understood that we didn\u2019t have to laugh to enjoy \u2014",
        "I\u2019m already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can\u2019t, OK, I\u2019m gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out\u2026",
        "I\u2019m just gonna call her.",
        "Nothing he\u2019s doing is cheering me up.",
        "Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.",
        "You\u2019re right. That\u2019s good.",
        "I don\u2019t know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.",
        "Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef.  Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak.  I see steak.",
        "Excuse me  Ah, un guard.  Family style.",

        "Oh, you are such mench my friend.",
        "OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend.",
        "The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.",
        "Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it\u2019s yours.",
        "Oh.  That\u2019s what she said.",
        "Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.",
        "The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.",
        "Oh, party in the break room! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go! Thank God! Let\u2019s go to the break room.",

        "Don\u2019t make fun\u2026 You\u2019re making fun of me.",
        "I guess, I didn\u2019t know her very well. I marked her arm.",
        "I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I don\u2019t\u2026 I know, I know. I can\u2019t believe I gave her my bike!",
        "Oh, why do I feel like crap?",
        "I had rebound? Yeah.",
        "I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn\u2019t score and I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.",

        "No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don\u2019t dial Carol before I get drunk.",
        "Yeah. You know what? I am. I\u2019m gonna call her. That\u2019s a good idea.",
        "No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m asking too much. I think it\u2019s only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that\u2026 yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did <i>right</i>?",
        "Oh, honey, here\u2019s Stanley.",

And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That\u2019s how I want every day to be.",

        "His name is Bavon. And you know what? I\u2019m sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I\u2019m sure he would like to take a day off. I\u2019m sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself.",

        "Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.",
        "Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.",
        "You can\u2019t pass. You\u2019ve got to pick somebody.",

        "Dwight?",
        "Here ya go.",
        "Please.",
        "Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the \u201cAmazing Race.\u201d  And you guys are the retired marines.  And you guys are the mother and daughter.  And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?",
        "No, we\u2019re just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.",
        "Just bragging rights.",

        "Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!",
        "Here we go.",
        "Ugh\u2026 that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.",
        "Hawkman.",
        "Let\u2019s go. The men\u2019s room was disgusting.",
        "Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?",
        "You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.",
        "You know what? Let\u2019s get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.",
        "I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.",
        "No.",
        "Stop it.  Stop it.",
        "Yes.",
        "Ah, no. Don\u2019t worry about it.",
        "What?",
        "I don\u2019t know. Who knows how words are formed.",
        "Yes, Andy.",
        "He didn\u2019t say.",
        "No, you are remembering it wrong.",
        "Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.",
        "I knew it.",
        "Where were you this morning?",
        "Why do you lie, liar?",
        "You are lying right now.",
        "I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.",
        "Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.",
        "Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.",
        "Good luck.",
        "Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.",
        "Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman\u2026",
        "I said \u2018was\u2019.",
        "What does that even mean? That is impossible.",
        "But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody\u2019s spirits.",
        "Hey, what\u2019s up.",
        "Yep.",
        "I don\u2019t know. Maybe.",
        "Bathroom.",
        "Wow.  What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.",
        "Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.",
        "Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.",
        "Yeah, do you?",
        "What did I say?",
        "Huh.",
        "Oh, no.",
        "Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy\u2026 just\u2026 there\u2019s something about him that creeps me out. I can\u2019t really explain it. He\u2019s always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for \u201cbeing in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me.\u201d I don\u2019t understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.",
        "No, hey, hey. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.",
        "No, no, no. I mean, not because you\u2019re gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar\u2019s Mexicanity. So Phyllis\u2026 I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.",
        "Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let\u2019s get him one.",
        "Who\u2019s that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.",
        "Hey guys. How\u2019s the workload on all of Dwight\u2019s old accounts? Handling it okay?",
        "Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?",
        "Really?",
        "Don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.",
        "Nice to have Oscar back.",
        "Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.",
        "Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?",
        "Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.",
        "Um.",
        "No. I don\u2019t want to do any of that.",
        "No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You\u2019re going to drive me crazy.",
        "Hey.",
        "What\u2019s up?",
        "Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.",
        "Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.",
        "How\u2019s this place treating you?",
        "Oh, well.",
        "No. I\u2019m sure.",
        "So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.",
        "We can talk about that.  All right.",
        "Ladies and gentlemen! May I present\u2026 Mr. Dwight Schrute!",
        "Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You\u2019re gonna break it.  Not bad, huh?",
        "Guilty.",
        "Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.",
        "So does this remind you of your childhood right now?",
        "Wow. Thank you. Wow, that\u2019s\u2013 thanks so much.",
        "And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?",
        "It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that\u2019s what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don\u2019t want somebody sucking up to me because they think I\u2019m going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.",
        "Hello son.  If you\u2019re watching this, that means I\u2019m already dead.  Life is a road\u2014",
        "How, would you stop interrupting please?",
        "Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.  And when I came to, I had an epiphery.  Life is precious.  And if I die I want my son to know the dealio.  The dealio of life.",
        "Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won\u2019t be able to.",

        "We will demonstrate on Pam.",
        "Come on.",
        "You just twist your hand until something breaks.",
        "Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam.",
        "And remember no matter what, I will always love you.",
        "He\u2019s not going to be a murderer.",
        "You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?",
        "Okay.  From the top.  Ready?  Three-",
        "Hello everyone!  As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis\u2019 wedding.   So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.  And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don\u2019t already have one.  This may be Phyllis\u2019 only wedding ever.  It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.  So I am instituting prima nocta.",
        "I\u2019m sorry.  I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.",
        "I\u2019m trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis\u2019 wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.  Which won\u2019t be hard, because it\u2019s going to be awesome.  A lot better than hers, that\u2019s for sure.  It\u2019ll probably be on a boat.",
        "What\u2019s up spinsters?",
        "No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 2:30 to 3:15.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guy\u2019s night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, it\u2019s more of a guy\u2019s afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- it\u2019s uh, not gay, it\u2019s just a, it\u2019s a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys.",

        "Oh God-",
        "No, no, no!",
        "I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re not going to be there.  It\u2019s going to be good, it\u2019s going to be a great bachelor party man.",
        "You should get out of them.",
        "It\u2019s the only time he can do it.  2:30 to 3:15.  It\u2019s going to be great.  We\u2019re going to be doing some darts, we\u2019re going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious.",
        "I did not order a stripper.",
        "Um, not personally, no.",
        "I can\u2019t get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.",
        "So that\u2019s what that means.",
        "Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh!",
        "Gay.",
        "Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies.",
        "Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.",

        "Oh.",
        "Oh.  Hello!",

        "Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?",
        "He\u2019s in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.",
        "Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.",
        "And when they came over on the Mayflower.  Bow chicka bow.",
        "Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one.",
        "Look at that.  Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.",
        "No.  Yes.",

And you are engaged and I\u2019m sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay.  Shame on you.  Go back to work!",

        "Really.",
        "Well, Ben Franklin, you\u2019re really kind of a sleezebag.",
        "Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?",
        "Wow.  Thank you.",
        "Not really, look I don\u2019t know how to say this so I just will.",
        "I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.",
        "No, today at work.",
        "Yes. I kind of arranged it.",
        "So you don\u2019t want to end our relationship?",
        "That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that?",
        "You are.  You are.",
        "So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can\u2019t.",
        "Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?",
        "Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father\u2019s wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I\u2019m paying for the wedding. Which I\u2019m happy to do. It\u2019s a big day for Phyllis. But it\u2019s an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.",
        "There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.",
        "How you doin\u2019? You excited.",
        "Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?",
        "You\u2019re probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It\u2019s okay, if you did. It\u2019s a very natural reaction. It\u2019s your wedding. And you\u2019re nervous\u2026",
        "Okay\u2026 umm\u2026 I\u2019m sure that Bob\u2026 Wow. That is\u2026 that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah\u2026 Are you set on that hairstyle?",
        "Here, let me\u2026",
        "Just cover up that bald patch.",
        "Okay.",
        "You might be surprised to learn that I\u2019ve only been to one other wedding. It\u2019s actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.",
        "I hate you!",
        "Long story short: Jeff\u2019s dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said \u2018boo\u2019.",
        "This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis\u2019 father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies\u2019 man, aren\u2019t you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let\u2019s do it.",
        "That\u2019s ok.",
        "This is bull****!",
        "Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now\u2026 the wedding has no highlight.",
        "I can\u2019t believe I pushed that\u2026 that guy\u2019s lazy ass around all day\u2026 until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That\u2019s\u2026 well\u2026 I got news for you, Albert. If that\u2019s your real name. The show\u2019s not over.",
        "Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!",
        "Oh, shiii\u2026",
        "Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance.  Yeah! That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!",
        "Congratulations, Bob. You\u2019re a good man. But just know\u2026 if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.",
        "Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis.  Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.",
        "Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?",
        "I\u2019m already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.",
        "I will take care of that.",
        "I do. I know a fair amount about fine food\u2026 and drink. This is a white.",
        "Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I\u2019m Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I\u2019m going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201cwedding\u201d as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don\u2019t know me, I\u2019m Michael Scott, Phyllis\u2019 boss.

        "Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?",
        "Huh?",
        "Pop quiz.",
        "Why is today a special day?",
        "Today\u2019s a special day, because I am being honored as a\u2026 visiting\u2026 professor, special lecturer, emeritus\u2026 how did you, how did you\u2026",
        "In business school, Kevin. Business school.",
        "A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um\u2026 and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. \u2026 Really ruined eighth grade for us.",
        "Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our\u2026 A game. What was the most inspiring thing I\u2019ve ever said to you?",
        "Will they throw their hats, you think?",
        "A lot of times, at a\u2026 school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.",
        "Yeah, I know, I know. I\u2019m just saying if they did throw their hats I\u2019ve got a great line for that: \u201cMay your hats fly as high as your dreams.\u201d \u2026 That was a pretty good line.",
        "I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you\u2019re such a little spaz!  Whoa, hey!",
        "We have fun.",
        "Campus. Brings back so many memories. \u2026 That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class?  Whoo!",

        "I can\u2019t hear what he\u2019s saying, but he looks like he\u2019s really into it.",
        "Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone\u2019s textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have\u2026 a book\u2026 that is worth its weight in gold.  I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you\u2019re inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.",
        "So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be\u2026 a\u2026 thingamajig. Or a\u2026 a whosi-whatsi. Or\u2026  a Whatchamacallit . Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay . And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand .  Satisfied?",
        "Okay, I\u2019m seeing some confused\u2026 faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.",
        "\u2026And products!",
        "Well\u2026 okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.",

        "Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can\u2019t you understand that? No, you can\u2019t. You\u2019re too young. Ryan\u2026 has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he\u2019s a tease. Well you know what? He doesn\u2019t know anything, and neither do you.  SO SUCK ON THAT!",
        "Business is always personal. It\u2019s the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.",

        "Fire you? No, no no. You are moving\u2026 to the annex.",
        "A good manager doesn\u2019t fire people. He hires people and inspires people. \u2026 People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.",

        "Wow! You did these\u2026 freehand?",
        "My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  \u2026 How much?",
        "I don\u2019t see a\u2026 price.",
        "Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there\u2019s my\u2026 window, and there\u2019s my car! That your car?",
        "That is our building\u2026 and we sell paper. \u2026 I am really proud of you.",
        "What?",
        "\u2026Chunky. Do you want half?",
        "Okay.",
        "It is\u2026 a message. It is an inspiration, it is\u2026 a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.",
        "Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can\u2019t do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing.",
        "Wow! That\u2019s a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.",
        "So no?",
        "Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I\u2019ve kept a diary of all my sales.",
        "No, it\u2019s just mileage mostly, but there\u2019s one chapter that I call wisdoms. I\u2019m going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.",
        "Don\u2019t do what I say, say what I do.",
        "Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.",
        "This\u2026 You know this is a scale of one to ten?",
        "OK. Do you want me to repeat that?",
        "Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks.  Just stand right up.",
        "That\u2019s, yep a little flimsy. Umm\u2026 OK\u2026 Ahh\u2026 Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.",
        "I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple\u2026  Kids love candy bars.",
        "Lets try a little\u2026 Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You\u2019re it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.",
        "Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise\u2026ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on\u2026 rocks? Any one else?  Yep.",
        "No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.",
        "OK.",
        "Very good.",
        "OK.",

        "Can you confirm that the straps are tight?",
        "And now, the chains.",
        "A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that\u2019s why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It\u2019s um, it\u2019s really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.",
        "MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic\u2026 And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.  Can he do it? I don\u2019t see how he can.",

        "AHHHH!",
        "Yes.",
        "I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician\u2019s code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key\u2026",

        "I am on my way. I should be there in about 15\u2026",
        "That\u2019s what she said.",

        "Yes.",
        "Ok.",
        "Hi.",
        "Actually, it\u2019s polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.",
        "Oh, um, potato salad.",
        "No, it\u2019s not.",
        "Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.",
        "It\u2019s been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.",
        "What are you looking for? You bring dip?",
        "Awesome. I\u2019m going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.",
        "Over our love.",
        "You don\u2019t have to, Jan. This contract says it all.",
        "It\u2019s a heart.",
        "I love this woman!",
        "Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. It\u2019s weird. So\u2026",
        "Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.",
        "Ok.",
        "It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.",
        "Yeah, but you\u2019re great now, right? We\u2019re all great. Aren\u2019t we great?",
        "I could go for an appeteaser.",

        "Dwight, wow. That\u2019s not appropriate.",
        "David, how much did this house cost?",

        "You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.",
        "Oh yeah, they don\u2019t allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis\u2026 there. But it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.",
        "Crazy.",
        "Ok. Excuse me. What\u2019s going on? What is it?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Yes, but you could tell me. What\u2026 What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.",
        "What has gotten into you?",
        "No, no, no.",
        "Come on, let\u2019s go back to the party.",
        "Don\u2019t take that dress. Stop it, Jan.",
        "No, no, no, means please don\u2019t. Please.",
        "I\u2019m not going to slam you up against the wall.",
        "You\u2019re acting inappropriate. Jan.",
        "Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It\u2019s funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It\u2019s just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.",
        "Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle\u2026",
        "You didn\u2019t have any of the potato salad did you?",
        "Well, if that\u2019s the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.",
        "I\u2019m not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don\u2019t you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.",
        "I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.",
        "Whatever.",
        "That\u2019s all, you didn\u2019t mean it?",
        "I love you, Jan.",
        "What a weird day.  I don\u2019t understand it, but you don\u2019t get to understand everyday of your life.  Maybe five, ten days a year, I\u2019ll get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened.  Guess everybody has days like that.  Sometimes they\u2019re the nicest ones.  Still, I think there might be something wrong with Jan.",
        "No need for consternation, everything is under control.",
        "It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.",

I can\u2019t shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores\u2026 or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don\u2019t know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s\u2026 socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.

        "Yeah\u2026 you are\u2026 ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don\u2019t go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight\u2026 and you know science.",

And they freak out.  And they get to see\u2026 the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note: They might think \u201cHey, I should have been nicer to Michael.\u201d  But that\u2019s\u2026 not why I\u2019m doing this\u2026 Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.

        "We\u2026 are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.",
        "The watermark\u2026 it\u2019s a one time thing.",
        "OK\u2026",
        "What\u2026 can I do, for you?",
        "Well\u2026  OK, well\u2026  Um, wasn\u2019t really my fault.  The guys at the papermill\u2014",
        "The guys at the papermill\u2014 No no no!",
        "<i>I\u2019m</i> the head of the company?!",
        "No, I\u2019m a regional manager\u2014",
        "No\u2014 my\u2014 OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!",
        "That\u2019s insane.  We\u2019ll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.",
        "Doesn\u2019t matter.  Out please!",
        "Yeah, well I\u2019m calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline!  Did you get all that?",
        "We gotta do something.  This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not\u2026",
        "No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then\u2026 YouTube gets a hold of it\u2026",
        "You\u2019re right.  It will blow over.  But it\u2019s not\u2026 going to take\u2026 a week or two.   Do you know what this is for?",
        "OK, I think that\u2019s good.",
        "\u201cHello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.\u201d",
        "That\u2019s how devoted I am to this job.",
        "I know.",
        "I understand that, Dwight.",
        "Do you think you\u2019re taking it a little\u2026 literally, Dwight?  And now we\u2019re wasting tape.  I\u2019m gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?",
        "So I\u2019ll know where\u2014",
        "I\u2019m asking Pam to do it, please.",
        "OK, ready?",
        "Five, four, three.  \u201cThere is no way, I will resign.  It wouldn\u2019t be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Let\u2019s not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember\u2026 it wasn\u2019t me.  They\u2019re trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day.\u201d",
        "That\u2019s\u2026 they always give an ultimatum.",
        "Good, cut?",
        "Thought so too.",
        "The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don\u2019t act fast, you will lose customers.",
        "With dissatisfied clients, it doesn\u2019t matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you\u2019re sorry. They\u2019re like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I\u2019m sorry, it will be twice as effective.",
        "So we\u2019re good?",
        "I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right. We are infinitely sorry.",
        "You understand? You\u2026 you get this check.",
        "The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she\u2019s not our customer anymore.",
        "Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.",
        "And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you\u2019d be the weirdos.",
        "Are we ready?",
        "Okay. Am I shiny?",
        "Okay. We good? Okay, that\u2019s enough Aqua Net.",
        "Stop it.",
        "I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn\u2019t even me. It\u2019s so not fair that they want me to resign.",
        "What\u2019s happening?",
        "Really? Is she OK?",
        "OK.  Phyllis, you say?  Hmm.",
        "Um\u2026 I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh\u2026 Karen from behind?",
        "I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s pretty funny when you think about it.",
        "Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus?  OK.  He\u2019s back!  OK. Hmm.  Waagh!",
        "What? Oh.",
        "Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It\u2019s, uh\u2026",
        "Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she\u2019s not even here, so no harm, no foul.",
        "Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you\u2019re the flasher.",
        "Uh-huh. Prove it. Let\u2019s see your penis.  I\u2026 you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.",
        "In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can\u2019t have fun if they don\u2019t feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time\u2026 she pretended she didn\u2019t hear me.",
        "Huh?",
        "I don\u2019t know. I feel\u2026 I drive a lot. I\u2019m spending a fortune on gas and tolls \u2013",
        "Um, that\u2026 I don\u2019t know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.",
        "I\u2026 uh, well, I don\u2019t know.",
        "I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can\u2019t happen. Not in my house.",
        "OK.",
        "This is the last <i>thing</i> that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.",
        "Dwight, are those your pants? That\u2019s a Polaroid.",
        "Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.",
        "OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don\u2019t you just take these women, put \u2019em in a burlap sack, and hit \u2019em with a stick? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.",
        "See? That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?",
        "No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That\u2019s it. Conference room, five minutes. Women\u2019s appreciation.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?",
        "That is not current.",
        "You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.",
        "I, um\u2026 would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.",
        "Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.",
        "OK, no catfights. Please. Let\u2019s \u2013 my point is\u2026 my point is\u2026 a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.",
        "What are\u2026? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women\u2019s problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not.  Even the hot ones aren\u2019t really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn\u2019t care. Society sucks. I don\u2019t even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.",
        "Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.",
        "No. I\u2019m being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.",
        "Yes.",
        "Because wha\u2026 that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.",
        "I have to know whether you\u2019re serious or not.",
        "Ye \u2013 OK, yes.",
        "You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. And you know why? It\u2019s because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we\u2019re gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.",
        "OK, let\u2019s go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder.  Let\u2019s go!",
        "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s gonna make it. Don\u2019t think she\u2019s gonna make it \u2013",
        "Many women <i>are</i> competent drivers.  OK. Come on.",
        "All right. Hope nobody\u2019s on a diet.",
        "You\u2019re welcome. You\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome. OK. So, let\u2019s dish.",
        "Anything you guys want. This is your time.  Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it \u201cshmear?\u201d Like the cream cheese.",
        "What, um\u2026 what do you think of role-play?",
        "Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.",
        "I just\u2026 I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.",
        "Jan says anything that doesn\u2019t scare us is not worth doing. I don\u2019t know. Maybe we\u2019re different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.",
        "And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.",
        "No, it\u2019s not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.",
        "No, she\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s fooling around. It\u2019s a woman thing.",
        "No\u2026 No, it\u2019s all right. I\u2019m OK. I\u2019m OK.  You guys\u2026 what are we gonna do about Jan?",
        "OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.",
        "Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I\u2019m unhappy when I\u2019m with her. Flat-chested.",
        "She\u2019s totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.",
        "I\u2019m unhappy when I\u2019m with her.",
        "I\u2019m happy sometimes. Um\u2026 when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s smart.",
        "That sounds good too. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s right. I just don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.",
        "Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.",
        "Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.  Come on. Get in here.",
        "Let\u2019s face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They\u2019re caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But\u2026 for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.",
        "Mm. You don\u2019t want anything? My treat. Some panties or\u2026 pick a thong or\u2026 G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any \u2013 it just \u2013 you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.",
        "Oh. Oh, no.   It\u2019s Jan. What do I do?",
        "OK, it stopped.",
        "Uh, yeah. Yep. Um\u2026 Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will\u2026",
        "Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let\u2019s see.  There we go!  Good. Yes, we have the\u2026 all right.",
        "Do you have a\u2026 a crescent? A crescent Allan?",
        "Uh\u2026 you know what? I\u2019m going to\u2026 you take care of that. I\u2019m gonna do traffic\u2026 detail.",
        "OK, I am really going to do this.",
        "You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s do it.",
        "I love you guys.  Now I\u2019m getting her voicemail.",
        "Hey, Jan. It\u2019s me, Michael. I\u2019m just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s you.  OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I\u2019ll talk to you later.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Abso-fruit-ly.",
        "No\u2026 No\u2026",
        "Yeah.",
        "Maybe some Italian.  \u201c\u2026 to remain friends. Or at least business associates -\u201d  Chinese?  \u201cwho get along. Oh, just so you know, it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s you. OK, buddy.\u201d",
        "Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There\u2019s a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. \u201cMichael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?\u201d You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.",
        "Love it.",
        "Uh, yes, I am.",
        "Uh, yeah, it\u2019s okay. Its just, I don\u2019t think the cartoons are very funny.",
        "The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. I guess I get it.",
        "We should really start recycling.",
        "Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?",
        "Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it\u2019s uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.",
        "I got shotgun.  Damn it.",
        "Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!",
        "Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.",
        "Idiot.",
        "I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn\u2019t like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can\u2019t believe I\u2019m gonna say this, maybe, women don\u2019t understand themselves.",
        "Ughh\u2026 Blech.",
        "Just\u2026 all over. I don\u2019t want to do anything\u2026 I\u2019m dying\u2026",
        "Right there.",
        "Maybe.",
        "Not it. I don\u2019t have eggs.",
        "That\u2019s possible.",
        "Uh-huh?",
        "The CFO? Ohh\u2026",
        "OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.",
        "To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?",
        "And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there?",
        "Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan\u2019s heart, David, and it was awful. It was\u2026 It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes\u2026",
        "\u2026you just gots to get your freak on.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hmmm.",
        "Really?",
        "Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.",
        "May God guide you in your quest.",
        "OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.",
        "Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?",
        "Well, you can\u2019t swim in leather pants.  I\u2019m just yankin\u2019 your chain.  Not literally.",
        "Oh, you know what? Uh, you\u2019re not going.",
        "Yeah, I know. I\u2019m sorry, Toby. We\u2026 um\u2026 Somebody has to stay here.",
        "I want today to be a beautiful memory\u2026 that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it\u2026 then it\u2019ll suck.",
        "Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you",
        "We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people\u2019s character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.",
        "What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It\u2019s like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.",
        "I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?",
        "This way to the partay bus.",
        "Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.",
        "If you don\u2019t like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.",
        "Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!",
        "Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm\u2019s turning people off.",
        "Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down?",
        "Like everything I said and everything they did and\u2026 Just don\u2019t\u2026",
        "Well write it down before you forget it. That\u2019s\u2026 You\u2019ve just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I can\u2019t stay mad at you.",
        "Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg.  Watch out for snakes!",
        "Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in.  OK, everybody up! Circle \u2019round.  Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America\u2019s eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.",
        "Just words. Inspiring words.  Not a contender.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.",
        "Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.",
        "Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.",
        "I\u2019m not playing.",
        "Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.",
        "We are going to choose team names. Dwight?",
        "Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok\u2026 Stanley, your team name?",
        "Then I will name your team the Red team.",
        "I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.",
        "Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.",
        "Andy Bernard. Pros: He\u2019s classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don\u2019t really trust him.",
        "It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.",
        "Shh\u2026 The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!",
        "Pam\u2026you\u2019re missing things.",
        "Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.",
        "Smart as a whip! Yes!  These are pre-cooked, so it\u2019s not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I\u2019m going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.",
        "Like umm\u2026 ten minutes?",
        "Thanks a bunch.",
        "A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.",
        "OK, who\u2019s hungry  No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest.  For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.",
        "No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?",
        "Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease\u2026 Let\u2019s just\u2026 OK, it\u2019s very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!",
        "No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it\u2019ll slide down your gullet more easily.",
        "Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.",
        "I can\u2019t say.",
        "The winner gets a regional manager\u2019s salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.",
        "The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I\u2019m interviewing for a job at corporate. And they\u2019re only interviewing a handful of people and I\u2019m the most qualified and I\u2019ll probably get it. Alright?",
        "I didn\u2019t want to tell anyway. I didn\u2019t want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don\u2019t know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.",
        "Word.  There we go. Let\u2019s see it.",
        "Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!",
        "13 hot dogs, everybody!",
        "It\u2019s very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.",
        "Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It\u2019s alright.  It\u2019s alright. Here we go.",
        "Aaaaaand, go!",
        "Nice, Stanley!",
        "One. Two. Three.",
        "Excellent!",
        "I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah\u2026 who\u2019s ahead in points?",
        "Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.",
        "Please just check.",
        "What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.",
        "Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!",
        "Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.",
        "No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.",
        "Pointless.",
        "Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you\u2019re up.",
        "Ji.. why not? C\u2019mon.",
        "You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.",
        "Who\u2019s next? Andy? Where\u2019s Andy? Andy is never here today.",
        "Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.",
        "Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. \u2018kay.  The mind has to wrap around the foot.  Okay.",
        "Yes. Count to three, please.",
        "Count the other way. Count\u2026 no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.",
        "Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?",
        "Okay.",
        "Don\u2019t, don\u2019t.",
        "I\u2019m not going to give it to you.",
        "Being the boss is also about image.  I\u2019ve never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don\u2019t see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. \u201cOutside Hire.\u201d",
        "Yeah.  Ummm, hmm\u2026 True.  Look, I don\u2019t want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.",
        "God! He\u2019s a comedian.",
        "Who\u2019s Amanda Bynes?",
        "Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.",
        "You are being too modest.",
        "Hhhh\u2026 okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.",
        "That is a very, very funny story.",
        "Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.",
        "WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!",
        "So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.",
        "No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.",
        "Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out?",
        "Acrimonious.",
        "This way to the party bus. Good.",
        "It\u2019s a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.",
        "Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?",
        "Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson.",
        "Nothing.",
        "No.",
        "No!",
        "No.",
        "No, we are not.",
        "You are really annoying me. If you don\u2019t knock it off\u2026",
        "\u2026I\u2019m never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!",
        "No. We\u2019re only 10 minutes from the lake.",
        "Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.",
        "Any questions?",
        "Yup.",
        "Yes, for dramatic affect.",
        "Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?",
        "Set!",
        "Go!",
        "Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?",
        "Because he wasn\u2019t following the rules.",
        "But they didn\u2019t complete their task, Pam! If people can\u2019t carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?",
        "Exactly. Are you sure you\u2019re doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.",
        "Okay, all right.",
        "It\u2019s very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can\u2026",
        "Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!",
        "No mustard! No mustard! Just\u2026 eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.",
        "No, no, no, no, not that\u2014 just\u2026 come on, you guys, let\u2019s do it! I\u2019m serious. Who\u2019s got the hungry?",
        "Who\u2019s got the hungry?",
        "Come on, Ryan\u2026",
        "Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.",
        "Ready! Go!",
        "You? You haven\u2019t made a sale.",
        "Don\u2019t try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.",
        "Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!",
        "This is an inflatable sumo suit.  Now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.  Well, times have changed.  And it\u2019s not even about who is the best sumo wrestler.  It\u2019s about who is the best boss.  And I don\u2019t even care who wins.  It\u2019s how they wrestle in a blow-up suit\u2026  that will tell me all I need to know  or how sumo\u2026",
        "David!",
        "Are we all set?",
        "Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I\u2019d drop in and say hello.",
        "Thought I\u2019d catch a show.",
        "Naaah. You know what? Since I\u2019m here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.",
        "Um, how many people are you interviewing?",
        "Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?",
        "Great. One more\u2026 question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?",
        "Ah, great. No further questions.",
        "Okay.",
        "And I\u2019m really looking forward to working with you.",
        "I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons.  Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I\u2019ll be like three hours late.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.",
        "Okay. Uh\u2026",
        "Uh, okay.",
        "Stop crying.",
        "Ohhhhh\u2026",
        "Why so you can do it?",
        "No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger\u2026",
        "Moon each other.",
        "All right.",
        "Your loss.",
        "Cruise control.",
        "There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.",
        "No. Not at all. I haven\u2019t talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.",
        "No, no, no. You know what? It\u2019s a done deal. I basically have the job already. There\u2019s nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.",
        "Yes, I\u2026",
        "I have to buy another place.",
        "I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.",
        "Who is D. Abramson?",
        "Why\u2026 are you here?",
        "I\u2019m good. How are you, Janet? It\u2019s good to see you.",
        "Why privately?",
        "Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don\u2019t you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.",
        "Okay.",
        "Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.",
        "Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.",
        "No. She\u2019s an alternate.",
        "So, how you been?",
        "Good.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Weird. Yeah, I didn\u2019t get both of your messages.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Sound good. Sounds fun.",
        "Hmm..",
        "Would you excuse me for a second?",
        "Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.",
        "I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s why you\u2019re here, help me. Please\u2026",
        "No, no. What do I do?",
        "What if she makes me?",
        "She made me do a lot of things I didn\u2019t wanna do.",
        "I wasn\u2019t.",
        "You\u2019re right. You\u2019re absolutely right. I\u2019m gonna go in there and tell her that we can\u2019t be together.",
        "Wow.",
        "I\u2019m in a very good place right now. Thank you.",
        "Okay.  Jan, we need to talk.",
        "Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.",
        "Yeah.",
        "First got priorities.",
        "Let\u2019s get back together.",
        "No.  No, no, no, no.  I\u2019ll tell you this, it is <i>not</i> because of the boob job.  Excuse me, boob enhancement.  That would be shallow.  And this is the opposite of shallow.  This is\u2026 emotionally magnificent.",
        "Remarkable.",
        "Wait, wait. Check one more time.",
        "Very good",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "So, I guess we\u2019re getting back together.",
        "Your advice was good, but Jan\u2019s was bigger.",
        "Here\u2019s the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn\u2019t connect, I was miserable. Now, I\u2019m in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.",
        "Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I\u2019ll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,   I would like to start saying my goodbyes  Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.",
        "How are you guys doing?  Need anything?",
        "I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody\u2019s names.  If you need to know somebody\u2019s name, just ask me.",
        "<i>That</i> is Beardy.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "No, no, no, just\u2026 that\u2019s not his real name.  That\u2019s just what I call him, so\u2026",
        "I am by far the most qualified person they\u2019re interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They\u2019re like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy\u2026 is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.",
        "Hey!  Hunter!  Wha\u2019s up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.",
        "Jan in yet?",
        "Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?",
        "Just say, \u201cI want to squeeze them.\u201d  It\u2019s code.  She\u2019ll know what it means.",
        "Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her,  \u201cBrbrbrbrbr!\u201d also?",
        "Hello, hello!",
        "Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.",
        "Why don\u2019t I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.",
        "Well, my weaknesses are actually\u2026 strengths.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I\u2019ve never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, \u201cPaper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We\u2019re GRRRRRRRRRREAT!\u201d  I don\u2019t know, could be good.  Or, uh, \u201cSuper Duper Paper.  It\u2019s super duper.\u201d  I don\u2019t know, something like that.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you.",
        "It is always a treat when <i>our</i> paths cross.  So, oh!  Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn\u2019t already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together.  So\u2026 I may need to fill out one of those love documents again.",
        "Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her\u2026 or on top of her.  Mm, that\u2019s not sexual, just\u2026 we\u2019re all professionals.",
        "I don\u2019t understand. So, we\u2019re gonna tag team it?",
        "Hey.",
        "Pretty good.",
        "Could have gone better I guess.",
        "Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.",
        "Daaah, let\u2019s just run away together.  Let\u2019s just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would\u2026 be fine.  We\u2019d have fun.",
        "I can\u2019t tell you.",
        "Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan\u2014",
        "Hey!  <i>You\u2019re</i>  unstable!",
        "No\u2014 We\u2019re all unstable.",
        "David, I did not tell her.",
        "So, I am gonna\u2026 give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.",
        "Good, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.",
        "You know what?  That\u2026 is actually good\u2026 because, um, I don\u2019t think I could take\u2026 my girlfriend\u2019s job.  That\u2019s not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?",
        "Good.  Very good.  I\u2019m glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.",
        "Good.  That\u2019s all I ever wanted.  These two.  Either one of them\u2026 excellent candidates.",
        "I know.  I know, I\u2019m sorry about that.  That was terrible.",
        "Well, it\u2019s\u2026  No, don\u2019t cry, it\u2019s gonna be OK.",
        "I don\u2019t know.   Well I guess\u2026 you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale.  Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.",
        "I\u2019ll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!",
        "No.  No, Pam.  I\u2019m baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.",
        "Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  \u201cMichael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.\u201d  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?",
        "That\u2019s stupid.",
        "You shouldn\u2019t have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I\u2019m baaaaaack.   Ryan, coffee.",
        "No, it\u2019s for me, bimbo.  Kids.",
        "So I\u2019m back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place\u2026 is like\u2026 the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my\u2026 graveyard\u2026 for my bones.",
        "Back to work.  Still waitin\u2019 on that coffee.",
        "Well,  I\u2019ve actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it\u2019s the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.",
        "Well, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s gonna be called, but\u2026 my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future\u2026 is me.",
        "Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that\u2026 I couldn\u2019t take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is\u2026 my home.  And home is where the hardest.",
        "Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they\u2019d help each other out like that at corporate?  I think not!",
        "New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had,  but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he\u2019s a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so\u2026 free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win.",
        "Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning\u2026 well she bought the milk. It\u2019s soy.  This is why I do it, that\u2019s what I have to come home to.  She probably won\u2019t be up for a few hours.",
        "This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um\u2026 Andy and Dwight are rockin\u2019 the sales team. I feel very blessed.",
        "Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.",
        "It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could\u2026 And she is going to be OK.",
        "Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah\u2026 people have survived far worse.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.",
        "It was an accident.",
        "No.",
        "My lord my liege.",
        "So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?",
        "So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.",
        "Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.",
        "No, I was being negligent. But she\u2019s in the hospital, she\u2019s fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in\u2026",
        "Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so\u2026 double jeopardy, we are fine.",
        "Oh, right, I\u2019m sorry. What is: we are fine?",
        "Ok, I have an announcement.",
        "No.",
        "No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I\u2019m just trying to take everybody\u2019s mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.",
        "So, like a freedom tree.",
        "Pam.",
        "Pam.",
        "Ok, good good, so we\u2019ll just all go down there together at lunch.",
        "Excellent!",
        "Good work Pam.",
        "Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?",
        "Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!",
        "Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don\u2019t know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I\u2019ll hit somebody with my car. So sue me\u2026 No, don\u2019t sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I\u2019m trying to make.",
        "Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh\u2026 She looks like an angel.",
        "No\u2026 OK, she always looks like that\u2026 That is not my fault.",
        "No\u2026 She\u2019s in a coma.",
        "OK\u2026 Meredith,  Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Brought you some balloons. Why don\u2019t we\u2026 here you go.  Tie these up, cheer up your tubes\u2026  Oh! Shhhh\u2026 For God\u2019s sake!",
        "Nurse.",
        "I am going to be sick\u2026 I\u2019m gonna puke.",
        "Oh, OK\u2026 Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.",
        "Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.",
        "Well, just shhhh\u2026 just just\u2026",
        "Look, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.",
        "Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.",
        "Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it\u2019s not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.",
        "OK, you know what? Everybody, let\u2019s just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let\u2019s just\u2026",
        "Sprinkles?",
        "Oh, sh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then\u2026 Sprinkles! God, that\u2019s 3 things. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.",
        "Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I\u2019m not superstitious, but\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I am a little-stitious.",
        "Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?",
        "Like park on it. Or dig up a body\u2026 Toby? Anything you want to tell us?",
        "Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.",
        "Dwight, you haven\u2019t seen Meredith yet, have you?",
        "Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.",
        "Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.",
        "Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.",
        "Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let\u2019s just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.",
        "OK.",
        "Alright.",
        "Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.",
        "Are you sure?",
        "What are you?",
        "OK, 1 Sikh, and\u2026",
        "You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.  And it\u2019s not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026 God is dead.",
        "Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there\u2019s some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just\u2026 the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah\u2026 the body of a porcupine.",
        "Oh God, Rabies?",
        "I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?",
        "This place is so cursed.",
        "I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith\u2019s life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.",
        "Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people!  Oh\u2026 there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.",
        "Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus\u2019 dad?",
        "Pro-Am.",
        "A woman shouldn\u2019t have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I\u2019m hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.",
        "Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?",
        "Come on man, gotta step it up! It\u2019s for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.",
        "That\u2026 is for a good cause. Phyllis, how\u2019s the rabies quilt coming?",
        "Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.",
        "Yes.",
        "OK.",
        "Alright, alright.",
        "Shhh\u2026",
        "I know that you\u2019re probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.",
        "OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields\u2026 And I was a peasant.",
        "Well, you\u2019re going to have to run, or you\u2019re going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.",
        "We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um\u2026 when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?",
        "Hmm\u2026 That\u2019s a tough decision. Um\u2026 I always imagined it with a giant check. So\u2026",
        "Yep.",
        "You didn\u2019t contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how\u2019s that been going?",
        "What about a rabies nurse?",
        "That\u2019s possible. Look into that.",
        "Have you met that kid? He\u2019s not going to college.",
        "Come in.",
        "Hey, hey, hey",
        "What are you doing?",
        "No I didn\u2019t, just please don\u2019t\u2026",
        "May I enter the room?",
        "See how I did that. That\u2019s the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.",
        "Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.",
        "European offices are naked all the time.",
        "Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so\u2026",
        "That\u2019s not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you\u2019re an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don\u2019t want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it\u2019s not fair to people with rabies. And that\u2019s the point, right? OK, let\u2019s go have some fun.",
        "Check that out.  Look at me, I\u2019m Toby, I\u2019m stretching, I know what I\u2019m doing. Why is he even here?",
        "OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I\u2019d like you to take a look into the face of rabies.  That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three\u2026 too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something\u2026 Darryl what are you doing.",
        "No, don\u2019t give him\u2026 just, did you hear anything I said?",
        "He\u2019s happy because he\u2019s insane. You know what, that\u2019s the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where\u2019s the nurse?  This is the reason we\u2019re here.",
        "Oh hey, I know you\u2026 Elizabeth?",
        "Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.",
        "You got it?",
        "OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.",
        "Just remember folks, it\u2019s not about winning, it is about finishing.",
        "Beow!",
        "On your left!",
        "I am fast! I\u2019m very fast! I\u2019m like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot.",
        "No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water\u2026 solidarity!",
        "Rabies victims\u2026 have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So\u2026 least I could do.",
        "That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.",
        "Excellent! \u2026Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?",
        "Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I\u2019m getting a stitch.",
        "Take bat bites seriously. Don\u2019t get bit.",
        "I am not going to finish. I can\u2019t beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it.",
        "I can\u2019t finish. I feel so weak, I just\u2026",
        "What do you want me to do Jim?",
        "No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They\u2019re deformed, and they\u2019re abnormal, and\u2026 they\u2019re illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don\u2019t have any money. Public TV is bust. I can\u2019t do anything about it, I can\u2019t\u2026 you know. There\u2019s just one of me, and there\u2019s a thousand of them. And rabies wins.",
        "That\u2019s a good deal.",
        "Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.",
        "You just don\u2019t think I am capable, of making a difference.",
        "You don\u2019t, you don\u2019t know me. You\u2019ve just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I\u2019m the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this\u2026 GD 5k  No, no!",
        "Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That\u2019s why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I\u2019m very, very proud of that.",
        "Hey Mer. How ya doing?",
        "It\u2019s ironic isn\u2019t it? I mean I\u2019m in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you\u2019re in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.",
        "Thanks, I\u2019m not mad at you anymore.  Wanna share?",
        "I\u2019m not really sick.  Nah, I\u2019m good.",
        "Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?",
        "Well\u2026",
        "That\u2019s not\u2026",
        "That\u2019s not what\u2026no, no, I\u2019m not saying that, that\u2019s disgusting.",
        "I am saying\u2026 that\u2026 maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?",
        "Okay.",
        "Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don\u2019t know whose fault it was.  I wasn\u2019t exactly looking at the road.",
        "You know what, why don\u2019t go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I\u2019ll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?",
        "Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that.",
        "Let\u2019s just\u2026 Why can\u2019t you just forgive\u2026 Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren\u2019t born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?",
        "I\u2019m not going to leave until you forgive me.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "This office is cursed.    And we need to do something about it.",
        "Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I\u2019m just saying, at least right here  is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes.",
        "On the one hand, it\u2019s a relief to know that it\u2019s not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.",
        "We have to have done something wrong.",
        "That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.",
        "Oscar, are you Santaria?",
        "Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.",
        "Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.",
        "Stupid.",
        "Yeah, the, uh, the charity\u2019s having some financial problems.  What do I look like to you, Paul Newman?  That\u2019s actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face.  And I make my own salad dressing.  I mix Newman\u2019s Ranch with Newman\u2019s Italian.  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.  I could make\u2026 I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone  but I won\u2019t do it.",
        "Whoa, \u2018scuse me!  Oh!",
        "Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho.   You guys are going so slow\u2026",
        "Come on, I\u2019m going backwards.",
        "Oh, all right!  All right!  All right!  All right!",
        "Okay!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.  I will be paying out-of-pocket.  Um\u2026 I kinda wish I\u2019d been hit by a car.",
        "Hey, doc?  You forgetting something?   Thank you.",
        "Hey Toby. What\u2019s this?",
        "I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.",
        "Oh really.",
        "Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don\u2019t think. I don\u2019t think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight\u2026",
        "No way.",
        "Woooah! Wow!",
        "Awesome!",
        "You guys! Yes! Yes!",
        "Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here.  Come on. Come here. Okay, okay,  stand up.  OK, here we go.  Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.",
        "I love you guys, so much.",
        "No, no, no Pam let \u2019em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is  really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.",
        "Hey. Can you make that straighter? That\u2019s what she said.",
        "No.",
        "Blowing up balloons I thought.",
        "Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.",
        "Hey!",
        "There he is! There he is! He\u2019s back! And he\u2019s with a beard.  He\u2026 He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I\u2019m Tubs.",
        "Ohh, yeah, let\u2019s get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..",
        "\u2026business meeting \u2014",
        "That\u2019s right! That\u2019s right!",
        "Fire guy. Don\u2019t start any fires, Ryan.",
        "Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You\u2019re like our little man\u2026",
        "Beard.",
        "Oh, wow!",
        "That\u2019s a little kinky. I don\u2019t swing that way.",
        "Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.",
        "Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let\u2019s get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes?",
        "Sounds good. OK, alright.",
        "Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, \u201cDude, we\u2019re friends. I\u2019m doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we\u2019ll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.\u201d His words.",
        "OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.",
        "Ryan Howard everybody.  Good job.",
        "Who is?",
        "I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.",
        "Yeah, kay. I was just\u2026 After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?",
        "Yeah, I know I understand\u2026 we\u2019re making great strides and we\u2019re updating, but business as usual, no?",
        "Good, so, we\u2019re on the same page?",
        "We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that\u2019s who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?",
        "I don\u2019t want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.",
        "Oh, I dunno, they\u2019re launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He\u2019s being a real twerp about it, so, it\u2019s all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.",
        "Well\u2026",
        "What is that\u2026 word?",
        "So older people have just as many rights as younger people?",
        "Good, we\u2019re all here, we can get started.",
        "Have a seat.",
        "Have a seat. Like everybody else.",
        "Still my office, Ryan.  Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also\u2026 illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.",
        "Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?",
        "No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic.  Or the funny things that they can do, like \u201cwhere\u2019s the Beef?\u201d   Yeah.",
        "I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.",
        "That is me. Come on in.  Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who\u2019s this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?",
        "Sure thing.  \u2018Scuse me.",
        "Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.",
        "Bob, how old are you?",
        "Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?",
        "Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.",
        "Wow.",
        "Oh, boy.",
        "Great.",
        "Great.",
        "That\u2019s great. Thank you for coming in.  Robert Dunder everybody.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?",
        "Perfect.",
        "Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks, because it\u2019s illegal, and you will go to jail.",
        "No, No. Don\u2019t help him. He doesn\u2019t need help, Pam.  What a nice guy.",
        "Good night guys.",
        "I disagree, I think it was very valuable.",
        "I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.",
        "And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They\u2019re just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And\u2026 when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar?  Doesn\u2019t have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.",
        "We have a lot of colored paper here\u2026 why oh why do we keep printing this on white?",
        "Yeah!  I know.  I know.  It\u2019s bland.",
        "Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?",
        "Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo.\u201d",
        "Alright. Alright.  Let\u2019s quit while we\u2019re ahead.",
        "That was awesome. Thank you.",
        "Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?",
        "Oh, does he?",
        "Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.",
        "And\u2026 today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.",
        "Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it\u2019s birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP\u2019s, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City\u2019s finest, and I do not mean policemen\u2026",
        "The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.",
        "No.  It doesn\u2019t.  I\u2019ll find out tonight.",
        "What\u2019s that, pipsqueak?",
        "Ohh, lunch party.",
        "Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.",
        "Okay.",
        "Really?",
        "It\u2019s the European cut.",
        "Umm\u2026 hey.  Ah, what\u2019s hanging?",
        "Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?",
        "I had um, one of those danishes.",
        "Why don\u2019t you wanna go tonight?  What\u2026 all your friends are gonna be there.  It\u2019ll be fun.",
        "Just\u2026",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Na\u2026 no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I\u2019m a big loser.",
        "Do I have your permission to invite Carol?",
        "I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.  It\u2019s just the first\u2026 girl that popped into my head.  I\u2019ll find somebody I haven\u2019t slept with.",
        "So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.",
        "Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.",
        "Just let me know who the winner is.",
        "Alright.  I\u2019m ready to go and I\u2019m callin\u2019 shotgun.",
        "Yes.  Thank you.",
        "Oh yeah, you\u2019d better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.    I love ya Pam\u2026 okay.    I\u2019m leavin\u2019 inside Jim\u2019s car, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow I\u2019ll be back.  I\u2019ll be back.  Tomorrow.  Um\u2026 yeah.  So you know what?  Why don\u2019t you guys take off a little bit early tonight?",
        "If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.",
        "You ever read this?",
        "Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You\u2019ll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured\u2026",
        "Same sort of stuff in here.",
        "Mmwa.  Mmwa.",
        "Leaving Pennsylvania.",
        "One for me one for Jan.",
        "You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  That\u2019d be fun.  Friday?",
        "Wanna come over Friday?",
        "After work you guys\u2026",
        "Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  It\u2019s a club called Chatroom, and there\u2019s a password to get in, which is actually password.  So\u2026",
        "What are you doing?",
        "No.",
        "No, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not.  Na\u2026",
        "Yes.",
        "Well the invitation says VIP\u2019s only.  Is this how you treat your VIP\u2019s, Ryan?  We\u2019re already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I\u2019m going to throw up.  I\u2019m throwing up.  You\u2019re making me throw up, Ryan.",
        "You know what this is like?  I\u2019ll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn\u2019t let any of the Seniors go.",
        "Doesn\u2019t it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?",
        "Yeah.  I withdrew too.",
        "Alright who wants to party?",
        "Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.",
        "I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.",
        "Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you\u2019ve been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody\u2019s gonna come.  What\u2019s wrong with Dwight?",
        "Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela I\u2019d like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.",
        "This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn\u2019t as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, I\u2019m not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.",
        "How we doing on time?",
        "Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.",
        "Mmmhmm.",
        "Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.",
        "I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important\u2026",
        "Yes",
        "Uh\u2026",
        "I want it\u2026",
        "I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, \u201cWow! How did they get Al Roker to come?\u201d",
        "Yes you can.",
        "Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn\u2019t say that if I didn\u2019t hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?",
        "No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don\u2019t have a lot of time.  I\u2019ll get the pizza!",
        "Good news.",
        "Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?",
        "Same thing.",
        "You know what?  I don\u2019t understand when you all talk at the same time.",
        "Pizza by Alfredo.",
        "Okay, okay, what\u2019s better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?",
        "",
        "Yup.",
        "You don\u2019t have to say it like that.",
        "Hey",
        "Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.",
        "Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.",
        "You didn\u2019t actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?",
        "Okay, it doesn\u2019t say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it\u2019s policy, it should say it on the coupon.",
        "What do you mean hmm-um?",
        "It is your problem.  That\u2019s no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.",
        "I\u2019m not giving that to you.",
        "No, no you\u2019re not going anywhere.  You\u2019re staying here until we figure this out.",
        "You know what?  This young man needs to learn that\u2019s not how you treat people.  I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don\u2019t just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.",
        "Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.",
        "No, you don\u2019t even know what stupid is.  It\u2019s about to get all stupid up in here.",
        "You ready to give me my discount now?",
        "Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?",
        "Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.",
        "No!  I\u2019m an adult, I don\u2019t have to think or do anything.  You\u2019re a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he\u2019s better than everyone else, because he\u2019s some hot shot, and you don\u2019t know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?",
        "Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that\u2019s called sales.",
        "Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.",
        "Stop talking all at once!",
        "Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?",
        "You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.",
        "I\u2019m not kidnapping him, I\u2019m keeping him until I get what I want.",
        "I think you\u2019re over-thinking it.",
        "Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that I\u2019m keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our\u2026",
        "Trouble.  Okay, alright.",
        "He said no.",
        "No, no.",
        "Mister Overdramatic, what\u2019s up Kevin?",
        "I\u2019ll just wave and introduce myself.",
        "Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.",
        "Hey, have you seen Jim?",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?",
        "Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.",
        "I could have paid for the pizza.",
        "Oh my God, oh my God.",
        "This is Michael.",
        "You\u2019re breaking up. I can\u2019t hear you.",
        "Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.",
        "I will open the door.",
        "And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.",
        "Yes.",
        "See ya, drive safely.",
        "Okay.",
        "Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.",
        "Not now Dwight, please, it\u2019s not the time.",
        "What a horrible day.",
        "Bluh.",
        "Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  I\u2019d really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?",
        "I\u2019m going to get it.",
        "Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.",
        "New York.  Wanna go?",
        "Alright, you drive.",
        "Here we go.",
        "Mmm.",
        "Hey, you know what?  Come on, come on, let\u2019s go.",
        "Guilty.",
        "Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I\u2019m Ryan, and tonight didn\u2019t go the way that I thought it would, because it didn\u2019t work out for me, and I\u2019m very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.",
        "I never sold any paper, because I\u2019m an idiot.",
        "I made it with my cheese pita.",
        "I started a fire, I started a fire.",
        "And I\u2019m hot, I\u2019m so hot. That\u2019s why everybody\u2026",
        "Well, it\u2019s part of it, it\u2019s just the\u2026 uhhh.",
        "Wanna head back?",
        "What\u2019s wrong with me?",
        "I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me.   Don\u2019t avoid this.  I know you\u2019re dying to say it, so just say it.",
        "What, no.  No.  Okay, bags.  I have bags under my eyes, Pam.  I didn\u2019t see it at home, I didn\u2019t see it in the bathroom, I didn\u2019t see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light\u2026",
        "The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?  The big round things.",
        "Yes.  I have bags under my eyes, and I can\u2019t go to New York like this!  What do I do?  What do I do?",
        "Really?",
        "That\u2019s it?",
        "All right!  Martha Stewart!  You can be Martha Stewart\u2019s receptionist!  Very good!  I will be tea baggin\u2019 it.  Nn\u2026 no.",
        "Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to?  Not at all.  Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.  Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.  What are you gonna do?",
        "Coat!",
        "Steak! Where\u2019s my steeaaak?",
        "Get me Armani.",
        "On the phone.",
        "Where\u2019s Armani? He\u2019s on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I\u2019m so much better than you are.",
        "I owe you an apology.",
        "Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won\u2019t ruin it for you.",
        "Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what\u2019s best for you, Mo Chuisle.",
        "I haven\u2019t heard the same about you. So let\u2019s just go with mine.",
        "We already have a sofa. So why do\u2014",
        "It\u2026 folds up. You\u2019ve only seen it flat.",
        "I\u2014 Ok. How much is this going to cost?",
        "Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I\u2019m sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I\u2019m going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.",
        "It\u2019s just that you say it\u2019s gonna cost what it costs\u2014",
        "Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!",
        "Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.",
        "Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.",
        "Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.",
        "Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.",
        "Use to have two cars, traded \u2019em in, now we\u2019re down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.",
        "You can not, I have a thing tonight.",
        "What?",
        "Oh no, I have a thing tonight.",
        "How about this weekend?",
        "Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.",
        "You wouldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s a secret.",
        "I\u2019m sorry Mr. O\u2019Brian, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won\u2019t be that fast, but it will\u2013\u2013 it will be that easy.",
        "I just love sales. I love it to death. It\u2019s as simple as that. And I don\u2019t get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.",
        "Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.",
        "No, they\u2019re with me, so\u2026 this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!",
        "These meetings are useless.",
        "Very inspirational.",
        "Or a trained seal.",
        "Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?",
        "I\u2019m just calling because you responded positively to the\u2014",
        "\u2026Stanley?",
        "Senor, are you happy with your\u2014",
        "Have you\u2014 Have you considered satellite television?",
        "Well your son sounds like he\u2019s really motivated. I think it\u2019s crazy the coach won\u2019t play him frankly.",
        "You bet.",
        "Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes\u2014",
        "It is not a waste of our time.",
        "Vikram doesn\u2019t have my people skills.",
        "Well, I hope this conversation has helped.",
        "What did you get tonight?",
        "Oh, that looks good.",
        "I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Really?",
        "Wonder what I would\u2019ve been back home?",
        "I know, but it\u2019s competitive here. What\u2019s a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.",
        "I would\u2019ve been chief of surgery\u2026 Or a cowboy.",
        "You know what, here\u2019s the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he\u2019s just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he\u2019s an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He\u2019s invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It\u2019s not Terminator.",
        "I actually wrote a movie.",
        "I\u2019m writing one, yeah.",
        "Um, sort of a spy, thriller\u2026",
        "Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.",
        "Okay, see you guys.  Hey, how you doin\u2019?",
        "Okay. How\u2019s yoga?",
        "Wh-Why not?",
        "Okay.",
        "Good night Vikram.",
        "Hey, congrats on the bonus.",
        "I\u2019m gonna have it one of these nights.",
        "Good night.",
        "Um\u2026 that wasn\u2019t much of an introduction.",
        "Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we\u2019re gonna be talking\u2026 about\u2026PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!",
        "Yes I forgot about Ryan\u2019s presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.",
        "And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that\u2019s what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register\u2014 Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.",
        "Why?",
        "No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.",
        "My other boss, Mr. Figaro.",
        "What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one\u2019s business but mine and my other business\u2019.",
        "It won\u2019t.",
        "Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways.",
        "Why don\u2019t you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?",
        "Huh, okay.",
        "It\u2019s whoever, not whomever.",
        "No, whomever is never actually right.",
        "Not a native speaker.",
        "Well it sounds right, but is it?",
        "Thank you.",
        "No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever\u2019s name is Toby, why don\u2019t you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.",
        "I\u2019ve never done this before. I\u2019ve never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.",
        "Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company\u2014",
        "And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.",
        "In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can\u2019t do this.",
        "I am.",
        "I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.",
        "Hey Kevin, you\u2019re a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.",
        "Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don\u2019t know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he\u2019s tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?",
        "Do you know anybody in the mob?",
        "Okay, um, Oscar, I\u2019m going to need to take another advance on my salary.",
        "Hey guys.",
        "What\u2019cha talking about?    Okay, I know what\u2019s going on.  You\u2019re talking about Jim and Pam, if they\u2019re having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think\u2014",
        "Hey, hey, hey.",
        "Monkey problem? No, I\u2019m not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?",
        "Oh, I hate monkeys.",
        "I don\u2019t have a second job.  Maybe I\u2019m having an affair with Suzanne Summers.",
        "I don\u2019t talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.",
        "I totally agree with you.  But I don\u2019t have money problems, I don\u2019t.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this?",
        "Yeah, but I destroyed it, it\u2019s not even useable anymore.",
        "No you didn\u2019t.",
        "How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.",
        "That is a good point.",
        "Like the witness protection program.",
        "I\u2019ve always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I\u2019ve already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I\u2019m a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That\u2019s the life.",
        "I\u2026 DECLARE\u2026 BANKRUPTCY!",
        "I didn\u2019t say it, I declared it.",
        "Yeah, tell me about it.",
        "You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she\u2019s using them as if I\u2019m made of money, she thinks I\u2019m a human ATM machine.",
        "Oh, that\u2019s the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.",
        "That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that\u2019s how they got a core.",
        "Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.",
        "Right.",
        "How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?",
        "No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.",
        "We will find another way, we\u2019ll ask power-point.",
        "You\u2019re a presentation tool if you think I\u2019m gonna tell Jan about this.",
        "No you\u2019re not! Ok, just\u2026 you\u2019re not a tool. Look, we\u2019ll tell her that it\u2019s bad, but it could\u2019ve been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.",
        "She poses.",
        "Um, that\u2019s, how did you get that from what Oscar\u2019s saying?",
        "What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I\u2019m getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.",
        "Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and I\u2019m never coming back.",
        "Hey Jan.",
        "Not much, what\u2019s up with you?",
        "I\u2019m out of answers Jan.",
        "I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you.",
        "I don\u2019t know that.",
        "I\u2019ll stay off the grid.",
        "Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up.",
        "That\u2019s really nice of you to say.",
        "I think the engineer left.",
        "Don\u2019t sell your implants please.",
        "That\u2019s nice though.",
        "It looks cute though.",
        "I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like \u201cdon\u2019t pay for six months\u201d or \u201cyou can transfer your account from another card\u201d\u2026",
        "Do you think I\u2019ll get any new ones?  I could\u2026",
        "What do you mean, \u201cwhat\u201d?",
        "Were you listening to what I was saying?",
        "What is the matter with you?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "All right, well, go find some.  Get outa here, please.",
        "Yeah.  What?",
        "Um, my CDs.",
        "I do.",
        "My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case Logic",
        "And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.  There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor   What?",
        "I\u2019ve been putting money into CDs for years.  I bought music that I didn\u2019t even like.  No.",
        "I can\u2019t.",
        "I can\u2019t go back to that.",
        "I don\u2019t know if I can do that.  I can\u2019t see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.",
        "We will?  I can\u2019t.  I don\u2019t have an idea in my head.",
        "I have\u2026",
        "Okay.  What?  Um\u2026",
        "Tell me.",
        "Well, please?  I won\u2019t tell anybody.",
        "Yeah, I will.",
        "Yeah! Everything! Oh it\u2019s all good, it\u2019s all good. Phyllis!",
        "Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!",
        "We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.  Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so\u2026 it\u2019s uh, not too shabby.",
        "Okay, it\u2019s football cream. It\u2019s football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?",
        "Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.",
        "Hello hello!",
        "Michael Scott.",
        "Regional manager.",
        "Excited to talk ideas.",
        "You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.",
        "All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.",
        "I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The \u2018Nard Dog. Who let the \u2018Nard Dog out?",
        "He gives the best back rubs in the office.",
        "Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.",
        "Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.",
        "These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.",
        "Who else?",
        "Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she\u2019s in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world\u2019s largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world\u2019s largest prison.  But we zoom back further\u2014",
        "Actually I don\u2019t get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so\u2026",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Mmm. Okay.",
        "That\u2019s what Nassau came up with? That sucks!  Whoa.",
        "Well we can do better than that.",
        "The waving?",
        "Shrek! Shrek, I\u2019m a donkey! I\u2019m a donkey, Shrek!  I\u2019m just kidding. It\u2019s me. Hello Ry.",
        "Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.",
        "Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don\u2019t like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.",
        "I\u2019m creative, Ryan.",
        "Well actually I can\u2019t cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike\u2019s Cereal Shack. I\u2019m thinking we\u2019ll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Are you? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.",
        "All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn\u2019t even talk yet.",
        "Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.",
        "How about never hundred hours, sir.",
        "Hey thanks. Thank you.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.",
        "What\u2019s up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it\u2019s ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we\u2019ll do it on my dime.",
        "I\u2019m willing to stake my entire reputation on it.",
        "Okay.  And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.",
        "Has anyone ever come up to you and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not creative\u201d?",
        "Well they\u2019re wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.",
        "We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let\u2019s get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, I\u2019d like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.",
        "Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.",
        "Line it up Phyllis.",
        "Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought\u2026 I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.",
        "Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I\u2019ll make you a mix.",
        "Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.",
        "No, I hate it! I hate it! \u2026I don\u2019t hate it, I just don\u2019t like it at all. And it\u2019s terrible.",
        "Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.",
        "No. I said I hate the, the style.",
        "Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.",
        "Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don\u2019t get this, if we don\u2019t nail it, we\u2019re going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?",
        "That\u2019a girl.",
        "Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?",
        "Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?",
        "I\u2019m about to send the ad to corporate\u2026 and it is sent. They\u2019ll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay.",
        "Pam, please clear my phone lines.",
        "They could call at any second now.  Oh God\u2026I better call.",
        "Well, it\u2019s been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!",
        "No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It\u2019s not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.",
        "That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!",
        "All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let\u2019s keep \u2019em coming\u2026 oh, God.  Okay, Toby?",
        "There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.",
        "And that is probably why most ads suck.  Oh, that\u2019s them!  Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film.   Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?",
        "About dressing your best today?",
        "Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.",
        "Okay, good. Good.",
        "This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door.  Pretty but nothing special.  You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.    Who else?  Oh, Creed\u2026 is the old guy over there. Don\u2019t look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.",
        "And if not we can just make him disappear.  This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don\u2019t you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.",
        "So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.",
        "No, that\u2019s skeptical. Do sad.",
        "That\u2019s, that\u2019s a pirate movie.  That\u2019s annoyed. Well, he doesn\u2019t do very well under pressure.",
        "And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.  Follow me!  Let\u2019s get this movin\u2019.",
        "All right, let\u2019s start.",
        "You are my producer, you are a suit.  I am the creative genius.  You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.",
        "Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate\u2026",
        "\u2026and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.",
        "We start on a single blank sheet of paper.",
        "And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.",
        "Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman\u2019s womb.",
        "Bull man!",
        "This is bull!",
        "Ahhhh!",
        "If you don\u2019t let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!",
        "No!  No!  Jim, Jim, don\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026",
        "No, I can do it.",
        "I can do it good.  I can do it good.  Please, don\u2019t.  Please.   Please give me it.",
        "Do you want this open or closed?",
        "Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial.  Huh?",
        "I can\u2019t hear you!   Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be\u2026",
        "Okay, okay.  Who could do music?",
        "Actually, I\u2019m a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a\u2026 celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.",
        "This is perfect.",
        "This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.",
        "But, you will not tell anyone.",
        "Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.    Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  We\u2019re going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?",
        "Just go out, and come back in.",
        "What?",
        "Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.",
        "No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.",
        "Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?",
        "That could not possibly be it.",
        "You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.  Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.  The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.  I don\u2019t know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.",
        "How can I get you to stay?",
        "Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so\u2026 Tell me why you\u2019re really leaving.",
        "Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-",
        "Pssh, kay.",
        "Fillipellers, how\u2019s it hanging?",
        "To the left?",
        "To the right?",
        "Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.",
        "Yes, listen, um\u2026  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.",
        "No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but I\u2019m going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.",
        "You can train him.  He\u2019s very very smart, and funny, and charming\u2026 You know, I can\u2019t do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um\u2026  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I\u2019m going to poach one of yours.",
        "Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?",
        "Hi Ben, Michael Scott.",
        "I\u2019m going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I\u2019m a genie in a bottle, and I\u2019m going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.",
        "Get out.  Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess that\u2019s not as grabby.",
        "No, I fired them, and your next. \u2026 So what do you say?",
        "What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We\u2019re like Animal House.",
        "Jim, we\u2019re getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.",
        "What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.",
        "Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we\u2019re going to crush this sale.  We\u2019re going to prove, what the hell is that music?",
        "That\u2019s the problem, that\u2019s the problem.  We need rock n\u2019 roll Pam, rock n\u2019 roll.  Alright?  Oh\u2026 My\u2026 God, that\u2019s why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.",
        "What? What? We did?",
        "Look at his face! Look at his face!",
        "What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?",
        "We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we\u2019re doing.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Yes you are.  Oh, buckle up Jim.",
        "We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.",
        "In your face",
        "Are you calling Karen?",
        "Yep, get it.",
        "It had to be done, it had to be done.",
        "Hey Dwight, he found it.",
        "Alright, you\u2019re going to miss the best prank ever.",
        "Do you really wanna know?",
        "Follow me, come here.  Here\u2019s what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.",
        "No, no, not real bombs.",
        "Uh, maybe, maybe, I don\u2019t know.",
        "It could be badass.  Yeah, it will.",
        "Teach her to offer Stanley more money.",
        "So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?",
        "I can\u2019t imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is\u2026",
        "\u2026awesome.",
        "Okay, I will start.  Um, \u201cA.\u201d  \u201cA\u201d my name is Alan, and my wife\u2019s name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell\u2026  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um\u2026",
        "I\u2019m trying to think of what we could sell.",
        "Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound\u2026  The air-conditioning leaking or something?",
        "What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing?",
        "Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!",
        "I\u2019ll kill you man!",
        "That is just so disgusting!",
        "Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?",
        "Yeah, Dwight, here\u2019s how it\u2019s going to go down.  You and I-",
        "You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.",
        "We are in a stairwell.",
        "There\u2019s a guy, there\u2019s a guy.",
        "Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.",
        "We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.",
        "It\u2019s enormous, but it\u2019s got wheels.  We\u2019re wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running.",
        "Aha!",
        "We\u2019re wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.",
        "Save yourself!",
        "Dwight, you gotta move!",
        "Dwight, could you move over a little bit.",
        "Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.",
        "Just say you wanna get back together.",
        "It doesn\u2019t have to mean anything.  Just, do it for Stanley.  Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley.  Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.",
        "Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley\u2019s head, we will burn Utica to the ground.",
        "We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, I\u2019m gonna need some help writing a want ad.",
        "Um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass.  Big butt, bigger heart.  I can\u2019t do this.",
        "Of course.",
        "Really?",
        "Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden\u2026 is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.",
        "Woo!  Shotgun!",
        "Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.",
        "No, Dwight!  Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me.  You\u2019re gonna sit in the back left  where I don\u2019t have to see your ugly moongob.",
        "I\u2019m sorry.  I\u2019m sorry.  Dwight, you\u2019re handsome.  You\u2019re a very handsome man, get in the car.",
        "Dwight!  Stop it!    Can you help me please, I\u2019m being crushed.",
        "Would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?  Like I begged you to?  Pam would have understood.  Heck, Pam would have done it.",
        "You embarrassed us.",
        "Morning.",
        "Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.",
        "Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means?  Not real.",
        "So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, you wanna go today?",
        "How often can you actually donate blood?",
        "Your body only has a certain amount.",
        "Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.",
        "A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s\u2019mores?",
        "Hello, I\u2019m Broken Mountain. You know, here\u2019s the thing. That\u2019s not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself\u2014",
        "In the wilderness. It\u2019s not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It\u2019s one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.",
        "I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.",
        "I\u2019m sick of it Jim. I\u2019m sick of this place.",
        "When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called \u201cSurvivorman.\u201d And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.",
        "OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.",
        "OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts.  Hey, what\u2026",
        "Hey, hey hey! Dwight. . Dwight.",
        "Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.",
        "No.",
        "Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.",
        "Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.",
        "Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.",
        "This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.",
        "When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.",
        "This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who\u2019s abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.",
        "Well, yes I would. And I would survive.",
        "Well\u2026",
        "You\u2026",
        "You\u2026 you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real.  OK.",
        "I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can\u2019t retrace my steps. I don\u2019t know what streets we\u2019ve been\u2014  Ow! What are you doing?",
        "No! Gosh! Dwight.  Stop it, stop it! Stop it.",
        "Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?",
        "Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.",
        "Happy Birthday!",
        "Happy Birthday!",
        "Happy Birthday!",
        "Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.",
        "What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just \u2014",
        "Stop.",
        "Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.",
        "Alright, very good. Ahh, OK.",
        "Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight.",
        "Day One. I\u2019m in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I\u2019ve brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It\u2019s hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about  2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. It\u2019s really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources.  OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don\u2019t hit my corroded artery here\u2026",
        "There we go.  Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .",
        "I\u2019m going to wear what was once one of my pant legs.",
        "See, this is a beautiful piece of material  This could be used for all sorts of things.",
        "Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.",
        "I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I\u2019m loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me.  Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn\u2019t even matter.",
        "Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.",
        "I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn\u2019t come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I\u2019m startin\u2019 to feel it a little bit. Ohh\u2026 It\u2019s Creed\u2019s birthday.  Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.",
        "Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I\u2019ve made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy  may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.",
        "Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those  are nature\u2019s best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well.",
        "Yeah!  Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want \u2014 OK, alright. Yeah, don\u2019t do that. You\u2019re gonna break something.",
        "Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn\u2019t want to have to struggle to survive. I don\u2019t need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don\u2019t need fresh  air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don\u2019t need wide open spaces. Check it out.  I can also make it the sky.",
        "Hey, buddy.",
        "What up?",
        "You are relieved.",
        "So what did I miss?",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.",
        "Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you\u2019ll figure it out.",
        "That\u2019s what I said. That\u2019s what she said.",
        "I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.",
        "Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.",
        "Come in!",
        "Pam, are you my friend?",
        "We have been friends forever, right?",
        "Hypothetically\u2026 would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.",
        "Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?",
        "So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?",
        "Thank you for your honesty.",
        "Split the difference.  Hey\u2026 mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?",
        "Can you send Dwight in here?",
        "Mmhmm.  I had something very personal I would like to discuss.   Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?",
        "Okay.",
        "All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.",
        "No, just get me a case.   All right.",
        "MmMmm.  All I need\u2026",
        "No, Dwight!",
        "I\u2019m telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.",
        "What is this called again?",
        "Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?",
        "Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I\u2019m \u2013 God, I\u2019m so mad!  This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don\u2019t want to work. No we don\u2019t! It\u2019s not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We\u2019re not going to do it!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.",
        "All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there.",
        "I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?",
        "You said you didn\u2019t have plans. That\u2019s what you said.",
        "Dwight, it\u2019s couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.",
        "Hello.",
        "Come on in. Good to see you.",
        "Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.",
        "Except driving.",
        "Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don\u2019t know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.",
        "Okay.",
        "Totally your call babe.",
        "Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.",
        "Well, thats\u2026",
        "Yep, never been used.",
        "No.",
        "This is it, check that out, can you smell that?",
        "As you can smell there\u2019s a lot of different odors going on in here.",
        "Bond.",
        "James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn.",
        "Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.",
        "Well, I-",
        "Thanks, that\u2019s my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.",
        "It\u2019s actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.",
        "I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out.  I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space?  Voila, right in the wall.",
        "Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.",
        "No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.",
        "If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.",
        "Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.",
        "I\u2019ll get it.",
        "Okay.",
        "Very nice.",
        "When in Rome.",
        "Whatever you say babe.",
        "All right.",
        "How \u2019bout a toast. Shall I? Here\u2019s to good friends.",
        "Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.",
        "Yeah that sounds good.",
        "You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.",
        "All right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.",
        "Yes, I was watching Jim\u2019s face.",
        "And he was laughing.",
        "Look at him, he\u2019s laughing.",
        "Well you don\u2019t need two of you to do that.",
        "That\u2019s true, that\u2019s a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.",
        "All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-",
        "All right, Okay, okay, you\u2019re getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.",
        "No, Baah! But he\u2019s married to her!",
        "No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I\u2019m gonna pass, I\u2019m gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.",
        "Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.",
        "No!",
        "God, does anybody read the paper?!",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "I don\u2019t like that story babe.",
        "Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don\u2019t. I shouldn\u2019t say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.",
        "Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I\u2019m in hell! Aaahhh I\u2019m burning, help me!",
        "So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand . So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan\u2019s candles.",
        "Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of \u201cSerenity by Jan\u201d What do you think about that?",
        "I\u2019m sorry.  What now?",
        "Dwight is my friend.",
        "You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn\u2019t have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.",
        "Whatever I want? It\u2019s never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?",
        "When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn\u2019t so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn\u2019t want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.",
        "Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?",
        "Pam\u2026 I hope she didn\u2019t do anything to the food.",
        "I can\u2019t prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe.",
        "You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?",
        "Excuse me for a second.",
        "Ok\u2026 alright\u2026 here we go.  There.  Oooookay.",
        "Everybody enjoying their meal?",
        "Yeah?",
        "No. No. I\u2019m gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.",
        "Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that good.",
        "BFD. I\u2019m a screenwriter.",
        "NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!",
        "MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!",
        "OH GOOD. I\u2019LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!",
        "THAT\u2019S WHAT SHE SAID!  THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!",
        "You know what guys, she\u2019ll be out of the bathroom soon.",
        "Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.",
        "Oh\u2026 yes. There was some screaming but\u2026 um\u2026 my girlfriend\u2026 threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.",
        "Would she get into trouble?",
        "I will take the fall. I did it.",
        "Jim? Pam?",
        "No.",
        "Nope.",
        "My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn\u2019t come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm\u2026 And Jan definitely, if there was room.",
        "Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one.  I didn\u2019t really wash my hands.  Ohhh, what have we here?  This looks delicious.",
        "They need to be presented\u2026 royally\u2026 anyone?",
        "Good stuff.  All right.   Let\u2019s get down to some wine drinking.",
        "It\u2019s been a rough couple of weeks.",
        "Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.",
        "Yes.",
        "So she\u2019s passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors\u2019 dog\u2026",
        "And the neighbors blamed Jan.",
        "It\u2019s like, you know, the dog shouldn\u2019t have been outside in the first place.  Anyway, it\u2019s a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds\u2026",
        "So\u2026",
        "Well.",
        "Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.",
        "Have you ever seen this woman?",
        "Hmm\u2026",
        "Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She\u2019s got \u2013 I don\u2019t know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.",
        "Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?",
        "I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman.  Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.",
        "What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I\u2019m optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.",
        "Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85.",
        "I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.",
        "Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?",
        "I thought that you were engaged?",
        "Whaaaat? God, that\u2019s terrible man. Eghh, she\u2019s crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?",
        "Oh\u2026",
        "Yeah\u2026 ugh. She\u2019s\u2026  you don\u2019t deserve her. Alright.",
        "Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you\u2019d never touch \u2019em, because of your condition. Umm\u2026",
        "What?",
        "Oh.",
        "Hmm, I see, feisty. So she\u2019s not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?",
        "Oooo. Catcher or in field?",
        "Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?",
        "I think I\u2019m being very clear what I\u2019m asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?  It bothers me that you\u2019re not answering the question.",
        "Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!",
        "What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they\u2019re just hanging me out to dry.",
        "Dating shouldn\u2019t be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.",
        "Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don\u2019t wanna hear \u201cAhnnn\u2026 I can\u2019t help elhh la la.\u201d No. No. I\u2019m a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we\u2019re going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.",
        "Hmm..",
        "Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so\u2026 Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.  OK, yes that would be bad.",
        "That would be bad.",
        "Wish I could, but I can\u2019t. Well can, but won\u2019t. Should, maybe, but shorn\u2019t.",
        "What part of shorn\u2019t don\u2019t you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.",
        "Oh you can\u2019t because I don\u2019t care. Listen,  don\u2019t forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.",
        "Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try.",
        "Hello Wendy, this is Kevin\u2019s friend, Michael.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry, could you put her on please?",
        "Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?",
        "Well, I\u2019ll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.",
        "Well put it aside.   Umm\u2026 yeah.",
        "Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm\u2026 this one says chair model\u2026",
        "That sounds good.  Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy\u2019s, get my food. Come back and then go.",
        "She\u2019s dead?  She\u2019s so young.",
        "Oh, God. Oh\u2026",
        "Try not to be so hurtful Jim.",
        "Please, not at a time like this.",
        "Oh really? What\u2019s her name? Burger King?",
        "I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready. Is she hot?",
        "No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.",
        "No, not the five families.",
        "Sorry, I don\u2019t have time for this right now. I\u2019m trying to get a date with Pam\u2019s hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.",
        "Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So\u2026 behold our bachelorette . Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Is who a Michael what?",
        "Oh, that\u2019s not, yeah I\u2019m not\u2026 OK\u2026",
        "So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What\u2026",
        "Just making conversation.",
        "Why is it so hard to meet people? I\u2026 you know\u2026 it\u2019s uh\u2026 All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?",
        "You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind.  Look at that.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, and you can\u2019t see her whole body. Down here, she\u2019s got a boob job. Just\u2026 she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don\u2019t know.",
        "Oh, OK. Well, umm\u2026 I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.",
        "Now you ruined it.",
        "Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?",
        "Oh, OK, Well I\u2019m looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I\u2019m a man\u2026 of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It\u2019s just\u2026",
        "You\u2019re right. What do you mean though?",
        "Hmm.",
        "How did she die?",
        "God.",
        "She was so innocent.",
        "You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that\u2019s just silly because she\u2019s dead. What do you do?",
        "Oh, you move on.",
        "Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids\u2026drinking whiskey and rye, oh why\u2019d you have to go off and die? Why\u2019d you have to go off  and die?",
        "Return.",
        "This\u2019ll be  the day that I died.",
        "It is moving day.  I have spent the last month here at Dwight\u2019s lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um  ssp\u2026 No, I did not kill her.  We were just at different places in our lives.  No, I thought I\u2019d be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo.  She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale.  Fresh outlook, and it\u2019s all good.",
        "Oh.  What is this?",
        "You were charging me?  I\u2019m your friend.",
        "There was no other guest the entire time I was here.",
        "Okay.  All right, Dwight.  Take my money.  Go ahead.  Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.  The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.  Just ring me up.  Go ahead .",
        "Thank you, Dwight.",
        "Dwight, little help with the bags, please.",
        "So, what about you, Angela?  Do you have any single friends?",
        "A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or\u2026",
        "No, no, obviously older.",
        "Love.  Marriage.  Baby carriage.  Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song.  Jan and I had love.  We did not have marriage.  We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.",
        "Hey, Kelly.",
        "Nothing.  Just hangin\u2019.  Chillin\u2019.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin\u2019 me up with one of your friends?",
        "Yeah?",
        "That\u2019s hilarious.  What\u2019s her number?",
        "Mmm\u2026 nah, that\u2019s too young.",
        "Oh.",
        "All right, time\u2019s up!  Pencils down.  Please pass your future Mrs. Michael Scotts forward.",
        "Pammy?",
        "You don\u2019t have one single girlfriend?",
        "I\u2019m not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with.  Just fun, healthy young woman.",
        "A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?",
        "How \u2019bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?",
        "You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn\u2019t have to be a model.  I\u2019m not, don\u2019t rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.  There\u2019s face models, hand models, body models  \u2013 yes.",
        "Really?",
        "No, I am, it\u2019s all about the personality, Jim.",
        "Send me a picture.",
        "So far, these are my leads.  A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.  It\u2019s a start.",
        "I got gum in my hair.",
        "This just stinks. Don\u2019t touch it, please don\u2019t touch it.",
        "OK, let me be.",
        "I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley\u2019s car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.",
        "Kill me\u2026 right now.",
        "I don\u2019t feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.",
        "Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we\u2019re talking about.",
        "Smells good.",
        "Oh don\u2019t. That\u2019s disgusting.",
        "Well just don\u2019t leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that\u2019s nice.",
        "",
        "I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude\u2026 that, but the women I\u2019m getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren\u2019t nice, or that have great personalities, they just\u2026 They just lack a certain\u2026 Crawfordness.",
        "Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or\u2026",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.",
        "Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.",
        "Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad.",
        "Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.",

        "Yeah.",
        "They sound great.",
        "Would you have sex with Meredith?",
        "Do you think she\u2019d keep it quiet?",
        "Jim, it\u2019s not the horniness, ok it\u2019s the loneliness that\u2026",
        "Let\u2019s go to New York. We\u2019ll go clubbing with Ryan.",
        "Yes you can, you\u2019re single, I\u2019m single. It\u2019ll be awesome.",
        "Who you dating?",

        "I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.",
        "That\u2019s\u2026 I, I think that\u2026",
        "Ryan\u2019s assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.",
        "Place is packed.",
        "Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.",
        "No, they\u2019re just hotties.",

I was thinking about getting \u201cBack to the Future.\u201d  \u201cBack\u201d because it\u2019s on my back and \u201cFuture\u201d because I\u2019m the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future.

And then you put a wire on him and you find out who\u2019s selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who\u2019s really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don\u2019t understand a word of it.",
        "Best night ever.",
        "Like I said, it\u2019s not about the horniness, it\u2019s about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don\u2019t, I disagree, I say\u2026 let\u2019s hear it for the boys.",

And it\u2019s really not about me, it\u2019s about my grandkids, it\u2019s about my great grandkids\u2026 I can come back here when I\u2019m 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, \u201cThat\u2019s me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole\u2026\u201d I dunno, it\u2019s a good feeling.",
        "All right, everybody\u2026 Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You\u2019re moving in the wrong direction\u2026",
        "Ub, dub dah, don\u2019t need, I can\u2019t even hear you. It\u2019s just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we\u2019re going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.",
        "Ener-gize\u2026",
        "Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven\u2019t done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?",
        "Zing and pep, see that\u2019s those are the kind of words we\u2019re looking for. Yes, Jim?",
        "Now we\u2019re cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme\u2026",
        "An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?\u2026 Stanley, earth to Stanley\u2026",
        "Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.",

        "We\u2019re havin a little brainstorm session\u2026",
        "\u2026Good, this is good. I\u2019m going to grab a glass of water.",
        "Ugh, what?",
        "What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.",
        "That? In the conference room?",
        "We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said \u201cdid I stutter,\u201d and I said \u201cwha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?\u201d It was joking, Toby, alright?",
        "Well you don\u2019t get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you\u2019re\u2026 you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: \u201cHey um, you\u2019re poor.\u201d \u201cWell hey, you\u2019re mama\u2019s dead.\u201d That\u2019s what friends do. It\u2019s\u2026 you\u2019re so white.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "Okay, I will\u2026 I\u2019m not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but\u2026",
        "Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it\u2019s probably psychological.",
        "I, uh, see that you\u2026 gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.",
        "Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn\u2019t mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing\u2019s silly, isn\u2019t it? Friends don\u2019t need to apologize to friends as far as I\u2019m concerned, so we are cool.",
        "Uh huh\u2026",
        "Great",
        "What\u2019s the pink?",
        "Ok\u2026 Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?",
        "Other than me.",
        "I never said you could do that.",
        "I\u2026",
        "Okay, I will think about it.",
        "No.",
        "Hey.",
        "Darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?",
        "It\u2019s an advice question, and if you don\u2019t wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It\u2019s, um\u2026",
        "I know, it\u2019s very, very personal\u2026",
        "I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?",
        "God.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, so dig this: you\u2019re on the street, and one of your gang disses you.",
        "Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?",
        "What is that?",
        "Really?",
        "I would\u2019ve never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.",
        "Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.",
        "It\u2019s like a mock execution.",
        "Yes it is a good idea. It\u2019s the only possible solution I have left.",
        "No, okay\u2026 I\u2019ve had enough of you.",
        "Because I want you to behave as if I\u2019m actually firing him, Oscar, okay?",
        "I\u2019m not firing him. I\u2019m not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I\u2019m going to do, is I\u2019m going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I\u2019m teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That\u2019s all I\u2019m, okay, here he comes. Let\u2019s just\u2026 play act.  Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?",
        "Stanley Hudson, you are fired.",
        "I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.",
        "That\u2019s it. And uh\u2026 do you have anything to say to me?",
        "Okay\u2026",
        "Yes.",
        "That\u2019s not-",
        "All right, all right\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.",
        "Everybody, except Stanley.",
        "I don\u2019t understand why you keep picking on me.",
        "You just, do, and I don\u2019t know why, so\u2026 please help me understand.",
        "Well Stanley, maybe you\u2019re feeling that you don\u2019t respect me because you don\u2019t know me very well.",
        "All right, you don\u2019t respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can\u2019t talk to me that way in this office, you just can\u2019t. I am your boss. Can\u2019t allow it.",
        "I am good person, and sometimes, good people don\u2019t get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield.  Hey, I don\u2019t get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t respect you!\u201d Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don\u2019t get no respect? Airplane food. Why don\u2019t they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don\u2019t get no respect, some\u2013take her, please, for example.  If you don\u2019t get no respect, you might be redneck.  Respect is niiice. Borat.  What\u2019s the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don\u2019t get no respect!",
        "So I\u2019m thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?",
        "Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.",
        "You know, I don\u2019t care what he did to me.  He\u2019s mean to other people, that\u2019s what gets me.  He\u2019s just\u2026",
        "Everybody.  He just, he\u2019s always, he\u2019s always talking about people behind their backs to me.",
        "Like that people are stupid, and that they\u2019re idiots, and that they\u2019re sluts.",
        "Because he\u2019s mean.  He\u2019s, he\u2019s like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is\u2026",
        "And that Angela\u2019s a midget, and that  your chin is too big.",
        "I know, I know.  I think it\u2019s tiny.  I think it\u2019s too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly.",
        "Well, he\u2019s just mean.",
        "It\u2019s complicated, Pam.  I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.",
        "Okay.",
        "I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.  But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.  I\u2026 jerks don\u2019t deserve to be on pedestals.  Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.  Big marble\u2026 jerk stand.",
        "Pam, stand up.",
        "Pretty disgusting.",
        "Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m pretty excited too.",
        "Today I\u2019m heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.",
        "Yup.",
        "Why are you dressed like that?",
        "Like you\u2019re applying for a loan.",
        "Okay, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do: I\u2019m going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No\u2026 uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don\u2019t have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain\u2019t going to college.",
        "Let\u2019s go!",
        "A little over the top, don\u2019t you think?",
        "This is all we need.",
        "Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business!   Hello!",
        "Hello. Hi.  Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.",
        "Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, \u201conly the best and the brightest.\u201d",
        "He\u2019s totally wrong, Pam.  Hey.",
        "How you doing? Listen, I don\u2019t think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a\u2026 migraine worker.  Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.",
        "Oh, no problem.  And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of \u2013 okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.",
        "Are you mental?",
        "I\u2026 don\u2019t.",
        "And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.",
        "Hello there.",
        "Well it\u2019s funny that you should ask, because it\u2019s really more than a company\u2026",
        "Dammit, Oscar!",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being \u201clured\u201d these days. Thank you Dateline!",
        "What do you want?",
        "Who cares? I\u2019m not there, Jim\u2019s not there, why should they have to be there?",
        "Thank you!  What, what is this?",
        "This isn\u2019t Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.",
        "Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We\u2019re dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.",
        "Yes. And don\u2019t call me Shirley.",
        "All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.",
        "Hey!  Game over.",
        "Just-in time.",
        "Just-in case. What\u2019s your last name?",
        "This\u2026 just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?",
        "Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she\u2019s hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He\u2019s the most\u2026 important thing in my life right now.",
        "I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.",
        "This is Darryl Philbin. Isn\u2019t he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will \u201cdo\u201d you.  No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?",
        "Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.",
        "So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn\u2019t bring are even better. Justin, I\u2019m willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.",
        "No, I didn\u2019t. You misconstrued me.",
        "I, uh, hmm.",
        "Why don\u2019t\u2026 hey.",
        "Hold down the fort, I have to do something.  Excuse me. If you can hear me, I\u2019d like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&amp;R Block? Come on, I mean I don\u2019t even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force?  Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that\u2019s not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn\u2026 it. Okay, I\u2019m gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.",
        "Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.",
        "Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good.",
        "Well, kids today have a very short attention span.  They are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.  And today they\u2019re being distracted by the other booths.",
        "Hey, there!  Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin.",
        "That is a very firm handshake.  Ow, ow, aahch!  Killing my hand, there.",
        "So, what is your poison?  You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like\u2026",
        "Sales is and could be very, very cool.  If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.",
        "Right here.  We have a lot of fun.",
        "This is one of our staff.  This is Pam Beesly,  receptionist extraordinaire.",
        "Check that out, huh?",
        "Pretty nice.",
        "She sits there all day.",
        "You get to look at her.  Why don\u2019t you hold out your hand.  Tell me what you feel.",
        "That\u2019s called card stock.  That\u2019s what you\u2019re feeling.  Now what you\u2019re feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration\u2026 You\u2019re thinking, \u201cAm I good enough for this job?  Do I have what it takes?\u201d  And I think we both know the answer.  We\u2019ll find that out together.  You can keep that.",
        "Mmm, yeah.",
        "Don\u2019t fold it, though.",
        "We have the Dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it\u2019s sexy, it\u2019s sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?  The other day, in the parking lot, I actually found a condom.  So.    I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?    So, sexy is fun\u2026",
        "Hey, you know what?  Coincidence \u2013 I am going to go for a little stroll myself.  Are you psyched about the summer?",
        "Yeah, me, too.",
        "Okay, be my guest.",
        "And do your worst.",
        "Hey.",
        "So, I forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this\u2026",
        "One other thing I wanted to\u2026",
        "Ohh\u2026Nah.",
        "Hey, Justin!",
        "Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force?",
        "Time out.  You think this kid could be a fighter pilot?",
        "Okay.",
        "Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?",
        "Well, yeah, but you don\u2019t need the brochure.  The brochure is up here  and it\u2019s in here.",
        "I think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.",
        "I\u2019m right.",
        "Today is Toby Flenderson\u2019s last day. I couldn\u2019t sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy\u2026 There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.",
        "Mornin\u2019.  So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I\u2019m going to set my watch alarm\u2026 And\u2026",
        "First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby\u2019s going away party.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets\u2026",
        "If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?",
        "Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-",
        "Toga!",
        "I thought that you might say that.",
        "Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year\u2026 uh, as Nana starts to\u2026 but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn\u2019t know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. \u201cMichael, buy a motorcycle.\u201d So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.",
        "I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this\u2026 ugly weight holding me down, you know?\u2026 I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.",
        "Phyllis, can you do this?",
        "Toby\u2019s replacement. Ugh. Wow.",
        "Well, we know that Toby thinks she\u2019ll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.",
        "Why do you hate her?",
        "You know, Dwight, sometimes\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I think you say things just to agree with me.",
        "Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?",
        "We need to sell her an elevator pass.",
        "Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, hey, do you still work here?",
        "Nah.",
        "No. I think I will pass.",
        "Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here\u2019s how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I\u2019m gonna win.",
        "Yeah.",
        "T-No. He tortured me\u2026 with his awfulness.",
        "Y-You can-Michael.",
        "Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she\u2019s just an awesome woman from this planet.",
        "Here she is! Holly\u2026 You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we\u2019d have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?",
        "I bet.",
        "I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?",
        "Oh\u2026 What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?",
        "You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?",
        "All right.",
        "Yep.",
        "Hmm\u2026 Jim?  I am downloading some N3P\u2026",
        "Music\u2026",
        "For a CD mix tape\u2026",
        "For Holly.",
        "And I\u2019m looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.",
        "The two levels being, uh, \u201cWelcome to Scranton\u201d\u2026",
        "And \u201cI\u2026 love you.\u201d",
        "Hey, what\u2019s the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?",
        "I think I do.",
        "Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.",
        "Well, you\u2019re not a romantic.",
        "Oh really?",
        "Like, with who?",
        "Pam?",
        "Yeah, you took it too slow.",
        "This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.",
        "I don\u2019t want her to get away.",
        "Hello, Holly.  Woah, what are you doing? You don\u2019t, uh, you don\u2019t have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That\u2019s how we buy them actually.",
        "And the sequel, \u201cWoman Stands at Desk and Works.\u201d So, I have no idea how you,  how you sit like that.",
        "Sit on floor and put together chair we will.  Yo-da. Um\u2026",
        "So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I\u2019m not-I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not gonna be in town. I\u2019m going out of town.",
        "Kidding.  Acting!",
        "Acting!",
        "Yeah.",
        "I did it!",
        "I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know\u2026 not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.",
        "It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.",
        "Whew, oh God.  Laying a base. Laying a base\u2026",
        "Yeah\u2026",
        "Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don\u2019t you go home, and come back for the party?",
        "Yes we do.",
        "I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret: I\u2019ve been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin\u2019 for a bruisin\u2019 for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin\u2019.",
        "Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.",
        "Hey! Hi, good to see you.",
        "I\u2019m just having a little exit interview.",
        "Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don\u2019t you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?",
        "Okay.",
        "Um\u2026 Alright, well then, I will proceed.  I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um\u2026 Who do you think you are?",
        "Yeah. Correct. Um\u2026 What gives-what-what gives you the right?",
        "Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I\u2019ll take a little look-see.",
        "Thank you.  What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?",
        "Well, no no no no no\u2026",
        "No no no no no. I\u2019m not asking it. I\u2019m just reading it out loud.",
        "I\u2019ll kill you.",
        "Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think\u2026 that I don\u2019t even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don\u2019t know which is which\u2026",
        "What the hell is that?",
        "That\u2019s\u2026 What do you mean, \u201cMichael\u201d? That\u2019s not even my handwriting.  Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!",
        "No!",
        "Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is\u2026 a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.",
        "My gift is forthcoming, Pam.",
        "I am going to give Toby\u2026",
        "\u2026Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?",
        "How did you know?",
        "Well\u2026 That\u2019s my watch.",
        "Hey, that\u2019s good.",
        "Oh my God. Ryan\u2026 Oh my God.",
        "I\u2019m just worried about my friend.",
        "Just, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m holding it together. I-I have a business to run.",
        "I\u2019m cool.",
        "Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s baked on a professional level.",
        "No antigravity machine, huh?",
        "Ferris wheel\u2019s pretty cool though.",
        "That\u2019s what she\u2026 a lot of places are like that.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I like, uh\u2026",
        "Hey. What are you doing?",
        "What the hell is going on here?!",
        "There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!",
        "Why did you do that?",
        "No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best.  Take care of that, all right?",
        "Shh\u2026",
        "I\u2019m really sorry.",
        "Yeah\u2026",
        "Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what\u2026 wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn\u2019t believe in showing affection, so\u2026 sometimes I don\u2019t know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh\u2026 I like it!",
        "Alright! Let\u2019s hear it for Darryl and his band.  You know what? Let\u2019s also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?",
        "Probably the best one that we have ever had, right?  But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.",
        "I have done things like um, \u201cBeers in Heaven.\u201d",

        "What\u2019s the only thing worse than one HR rep?",
        "You get me.",
        "I don\u2019t know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.",
        "Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.",
        "How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, \u201cI told you so.\u201d  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it\u2019s a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? \u2026 Probably the funny way.",
        "Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.",
        "Get in there right now or I\u2019m gonna lose it!",
        "Now is really not the time, Meredith.",
        "Let\u2019s keep this rollin\u2019\u2026 Ryan?",
        "Oh, cr\u2026, oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay?",
        "What do you need?",
        "I\u2026 really want to keep you.",
        "Wait, what?",
        "Nnnngah!",
        "Yeah.",
        "OK, just remember to keep breathing.",
        "OK, good.",
        "Oh, OK! OK!",
        "I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.",
        "I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.",
        "I checked the route \u2013 there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.",
        "Andy, would you like to have my baby?",
        "All right, OK.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!",
        "Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.",
        "Aaaaaaaa!",
        "Just keep pushing\u2026",
        "I\u2019m right here.",
        "I\u2019m right here, I\u2019m right here.",
        "All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.",

        "No.  You have to just push it out!",
        "Keep simulating.",
        "OK!",
        "Keep simulating.",
        "Yes, I do!",
        "OK.",
        "Yes.",
        "Aaaaaaaa!  It\u2019s coming!  Here we go!  Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?",
        "Nice touch.  Good.  Let\u2019s try that again.",
        "It is going to be the happiest day of my life.",
        "Hello ladies, how\u2019s my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?",
        "Damnit, Phyllis!  I\u2019m sorry.   Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?",
        "She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So\u2026",
        "I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this\u2026 Two bowls of M&amp;Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I\u2019m not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where\u2019s my golden shower, Phyllis?",
        "It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. It\u2019s like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is\u2026 it\u2019s so bizarre and unnatural, but\u2026 it, it happens.",
        "Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don\u2019t talk to them.",
        "Make the party.  Don\u2019t \u2013 make the party, please, Phyllis.  Pump it!",
        "Ahoy, matey.",
        "Ahoy. So, how you doin\u2019?",
        "Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy \u2013 the child of which I have a vested interest.  It\u2019s all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly\u2026 fat and enormous right now \u2013 extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while she\u2019s here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And I\u2019m treating Ryan the same way.",
        "So this is Astird.",
        "Oh, OK.  Why didn\u2019t you call me?",
        "I could have helped.",
        "Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.",
        "No, I don\u2019t!",
        "Can I hold her?",
        "All right, OK.",
        "I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me, and I think it\u2019s because they see me as one of them.  But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.  If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.  There would be no government, and things could get terrible.  It actually, probably \u2013 it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.",
        "Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst\u2026",
        "\u2026trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  You\u2019re going to know them for the rest of your life.",
        "Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go.  Lion King!",
        "OK, come on, let\u2019s get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.",
        "I\u2019m fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.",
        "Ready to play some games? Let\u2019s do it!",
        "Uh, duh.",
        "No, the baby doesn\u2019t ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Let\u2019s just do what you were going to do.",
        "All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents.  I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.",
        "Whatta we got?",
        "Oh!",
        "She already has a stroller.",
        "OK, what else?",
        "Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.",
        "I could have helped.",
        "Uh, yeah.",
        "I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt\u2026 shortchanged.",
        "Phyllis?  Could you take-.",
        "Hey guys.",
        "Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.",
        "Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?",
        "I just saw this baby daddy-",
        "Why, Darryl, because I\u2019m quote white quote unquote?",
        "Well-",
        "It\u2019s- that\u2019s different.",
        "That\u2019s not a baby.",
        "Could I?",
        "I was just going to\u2026  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.",
        "Sure you can\u2019t stay a little longer?",
        "All right.  All right, everybody, we\u2019re leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.",
        "OK?",
        "Wha \u2013 that\u2019s, I hate her.  Wha \u2013 God!  Why would you even ask me to \u2013 I, I mean, not that it matters, \u2019cause I don\u2019t, but wha \u2013 OK, all right, fine.",
        "All right.",
        "You wanna go out?",
        "I didn\u2019t feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.",
        "Oh! OK!",
        "Seventeen.  I say seventeen squares.",
        "Do the boobs!",
        "Hey! HR lady, stop whispering in the corner please.  Very rude.  You\u2019re ruining the party.",
        "Hey.",
        "That was really fun last night.",
        "I\u2019m actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh really?",
        "Well\u2026",
        "I, uh\u2026  I let her win.",
        "So, when, um, can I see you again?",
        "No.",
        "Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight\u2019s no good.  Because I am busy taking you out.",
        "Why?",
        "Wow\u2026 Oh, wait a second, I can\u2019t tonight\u2026",
        "Tonight\u2019s so\u2026",
        "Too many times. It\u2019s all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where\u2026 you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don\u2019t know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I\u2019ll know for sure.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Some of what we order depends on whether we\u2019re having sex after.  Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we\u2019re going to have sex tonight?",

        "To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I\u2019m calling it crime-aid. It\u2019s like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Okay, I\u2019m gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn\u2019t get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?",

Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There\u2019s a point there. But what is the point? I don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it\u2019s not a little foggy there\u2019s actually something going on here-",
        "Do I?",
        "Yeah, I think that\u2019s pretty boss.",

        "Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please\u2026  Can anybody guess?",
        "No, a new copier!  Unless everybody can agree on something better?",
        "So\u2026 we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?",
        "Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let\u2019s just decide and agree upon one.",
        "Alright, so, teams forming.",
        "You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.",
        "Yes.",
        "Why me?",
        "Wow, okay. Well\u2026 I swallowed all your ideas, I\u2019m going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.",
        "Yes.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t decided yet.",
        "Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.",
        "Yes.",
        "Ohh, God!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!",
        "All right! Cool!",
        "I have no idea.",
        "Oh, is somebody making fun of me?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, hey.",
        "I do.",
        "it was fun. We had a good time.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "Um, no, not\u2026 no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.",
        "You think that\u2019s good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.",
        "Nine dollars. The boys\u2019 department.",
        "Look at the ass. Check out the ass.",
        "Look at that.  Unh. Unh-unh.",
        "Yes they were.",
        "They were.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "Sits on a copier.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Very valid.",
        "All right.",
        "See ya.",
        "Hahaha!\u2026 well\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, thank you my dear.",
        "Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay\u2026",
        "There he is! Hello, hello!",
        "Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.",
        "Mm!  Yeah!",
        "Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!",
        "Oh\u2026 ah, I almost choked.",
        "Hank, thank God you\u2019re here. The office is at a crossroads.",
        "Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue.  Yeah, take as many as you want.",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-",
        "Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here\u2019s the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.",
        "It is, yes.",
        "What?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, there we go.",
        "Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.",
        "So, the copier.",
        "All right, yes.",
        "Well, what should I do?",
        "All right, get out. Get out.",
        "Hey David-  I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I\u2019m stopping now.",
        "No, no, no, no, no. No. I\u2019m calling-  I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Mm. I\u2019m calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.",
        "No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I\u2019m not the bad guy.",
        "The what now?",
        "\u2026Like a tip?  $645?!",
        "I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.",
        "All right, attention everyone.",
        "I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier\u2026 is\u2026  working perfectly.",
        "Pam, would you stand up for a sec?  Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair.  Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct\u2026 it\u2019s a good chair. I think we\u2019re spoiled because we don\u2019t appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?   They don\u2019t have copiers. They don\u2019t even-  Gah! They don\u2019t even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.",
        "Do I know what?",
        "Mm, no\u2026",
        "$645.",
        "Right.",
        "Because that is how my mind works.",
        "Let\u2019s see\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t need $645; I already have $645, more or less.",
        "This is so stupid.",
        "This is so, so stupid. And, God\u2026  that\u2019s my phone.",
        "To be continued!",
        "No, I don\u2019t-this doesn\u2019t change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.",
        "You think it\u2019s easy?",
        "Okay, you know what? Why don\u2019t you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I\u2019m taking the bonus. All right?",
        "It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put \u2019em in a room, and you just-  Hey.",
        "What?",
        "Good work. I\u2019m proud of you.  Mother-",
        "What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three,  you should know that some people think it\u2019s cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.",
        "Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?",
        "Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.",
        "Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.",
        "Cool.  My horn can pierce the sky.",
        "This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.",
        "Alright\u2026 One more time around the block.",
        "Jim, Jim\u2026.",
        "That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice\u2026ka.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I know.",
        "Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn\u2019t left India.",
        "Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth",
        "No, no. I celebrate privately.",
        "Why don\u2019t we just do it now? We\u2019ll do it quickly.",
        "We\u2019ll do it quickly.",
        "What if we can\u2019t do it quickly? What if we cant do it\u2013",
        "Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.",
        "An intervention.  It\u2019s sort of hard to describe, but really its\u2013 it\u2019s a coming together\u2026 it\u2019s a surprise party for people who are\u2013 who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.",
        "Okay, how do you feel?",
        "Uck\u2026 T.M.I.",
        "Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.",
        "I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.",
        "Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.",
        "The aye\u2019s have it.",
        "Alright, well, let\u2019s look at this a little bit closer then shall we?",
        "Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?",
        "Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?",
        "Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?",
        "I got it on a website, that\u2019s not important.",
        "Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I\u2019m doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?",
        "Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to do.  I\u2019d like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I\u2019ll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That\u2019s how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith\u2019s drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don\u2019t say anything she\u2019s not going to get any better.   Yes, Kevin.",
        "That\u2019s\u2013 you didn\u2019t\u2013 you weren\u2019t hurt by that.",
        "Okay, no, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith\u2019s drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don\u2019t you have anything?",
        "Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?",
        "Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey\u2013 come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.",
        "I want you to say I\u2019m an alcoholic.",
        "You can say it as loudly as you want, but we\u2019re not going to believe you.",
        "Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you\u2019re dead?",
        "Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.",
        "Dwight\u2013",
        "\u2026okay.",
        "Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It\u2019s Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.",
        "You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That\u2019s my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I\u2019m not going to wish that on her. I\u2013 a watch would be nice.",
        "I\u2019ll be down in a minute.  Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?",
        "We did?",
        "Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we\u2019ll have to go someplace else then I guess.",
        "We could go there, sure.",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "I have a new place.",
        "It\u2013 yep, recently.",
        "All right.",
        "Yeah, oh there you go.",
        "That\u2019s good.",
        "We\u2019re party girls.",
        "It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all right.",
        "Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on\u2013",
        "Here we go. This is gonna be good.",
        "Yes you are.",
        "Shhh\u2026 just calm down.",
        "Come on. Shh\u2026",
        "Here\u2019s the door. Here\u2019s the door.",
        "Let\u2019s start meeting\u2013 Hello. How are you?",
        "I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.",
        "So do I sign?",
        "As it turns out you can\u2019t just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um\u2026 I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.",
        "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!",
        "No. No, no. There was wind.",
        "Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.",
        "I want another try. Here we go!  Thirty-one! Thirty-one!",
        "I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.",
        "Go, Oscar. Thirty-one\u2019s my number.",
        "Beat it!",
        "Today\u2019s a big day. My presence has been requested by  Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace.  He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I\u2019ll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so\u2026 probably bad.",
        "Wait, you still don\u2019t know\u2026",
        "You still don\u2019t know.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Andy.",
        "No, what I\u2019m saying is\u2026",
        "No, that\u2019s not it.",
        "How can he still not know?",
        "I can\u2019t take it anymore.",
        "I am telling Andy.",
        "Who should it come from, then?",
        "Are you still having intercourse with her?",
        "Did you ever have intercourse in this office?",
        "Well?",
        "You know this can\u2019t go on.",
        "We have to put an end to this.",
        "Come on.",
        "When will she be ready?",
        "Is she crazy in bed?",
        "How so, specifically?",
        "Really?",
        "It\u2019s too late.",
        "I am already walking.",
        "Okay, what does that mean?",
        "Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.",
        "Thanks.  Andy?",
        "Walk with me.",
        "Ohh, I do not have much time\u2026 car\u2019s all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say\u2026 say these things, that\u2026 are bad things\u2026 that you hear\u2026 in your ears\u2026 this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn\u2019t want to hear\u2026",
        "Well\u2026 no, I\u2019m not. So I\u2026 I\u2019m not very articulate today, so I\u2019ll just leave it for another time. Another day.",
        "Which will be fine. I am off!",
        "Thank you!",
        "Okay. I will\u2026 Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so\u2026",
        "Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They\u2019ve been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.",
        "All right. See you later.  Ahh.",
        "Yep.",
        "Right what?",
        "David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don\u2019t ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter\u2026 where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or\u2026 or where you\u2019ve been\u2026 ever. For any reason, whatsoever.",
        "Sometimes I\u2019ll start a sentence, and I don\u2019t even know where it\u2019s going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.",
        "This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it\u2019s cooler.",
        "Hey, what say we order up some pasta?",
        "So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I\u2019ve never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, \u201cKevin, is that a tweed jacket?\u201d And he looks at me and he says, \u201cMichael, yes it is a tweed jacket.\u201d And I look back at him and I say, \u201cI feel the need!\u2026 The need for tweed.\u201d",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.",
        "Okay.",
        "Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here\u2019s an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen.  Ahh!",
        "What you talking bout, Wallace?",
        "Hi, I am well, how are you?",
        "Oh, have you not?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "Fax, why don\u2019t you just send it over on a dinosaur?",
        "Oh, well, then, email it to me.",
        "I will seduce her.",
        "No, I will seduce her.",
        "No, I got it.",
        "Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.",
        "Alright, I am a local business owner.  I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies",
        "Michael Scarn.",
        "Okay.",
        "No.",
        "No, no, I never said Denny\u2019s. IHOP.",
        "Oh, don\u2019t start,",
        "You know what? I don\u2019t want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.",
        "You will have pancakes and you\u2019ll like it.",
        "So what?",
        "Maybe they are shrinking.",
        "They could be shrinking.",
        "Ah ha  Yup.",
        "Mm hmm .",
        "And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.",
        "Argh, why are you all\u2026",
        "Shut up.",
        "Ready to do this?",
        "Good. Here come the sharks.",
        "In nature, there is something called a food chain; it\u2019s where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.",
        "Hello.",
        "My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.",
        "Thank you.",
        "We are a law firm.",
        "You know, I will be honest with you\u2026 about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn\u2019t feel like a priority. So I guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have?",
        "Really? That many? This doesn\u2019t seem like a very big operation.",
        "Ah, so when did you set up shop?",
        "Oh Vietnam, I hear it\u2019s lovely .",
        "So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?",
        "Well that is\u2026 because\u2026 I am a genius.",
        "Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup?  Is this the cup?  Is this what I drink out of?  Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.",
        "Try 80.",
        "Hey, hey, how is your interview going?",
        "Don\u2019t blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?",
        "I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great  Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left",
        "What\u2019s going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that\u2019s not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?",
        "Why is this little 2 so small? It\u2019s, it\u2019s weird, you don\u2019t, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?",
        "Excellent! Way to go! Nice!",
        "Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It\u2019s going to be an incredibly hard decision.",
        "I\u2026 Okay, okay, okay,  alright, thank you.",
        "Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.",
        "I cannot wait to contact your clients.",
        "Haha, we struck the mother load!",
        "Wallace is going to freak.",
        "He\u2019s going to absolutely freak.",
        "Oh shoot.",
        "Oh God, what was that?",
        "Aw, it\u2019s alright.",
        "Aw, my car.",
        "No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.",
        "Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so\u2026",
        "No, no, really not necessary.",
        "You know let me give you some money for this.",
        "Oh coffee, that\u2019s too much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Ok, goodbye Prince Family.",
        "Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?",
        "Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We\u2019re doing fine. They\u2019re doing fine.",
        "Why don\u2019t we just, live and let live?",
        "Live and let live.",

It\u2019s what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.",
        "Ok everybody, I\u2019ve figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.  You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what\u2019s causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short\u2026",
        "What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c\u2019mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You\u2019ve seen it right?

I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine\u2019s, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There\u2019s a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.",

You know what, sometimes it\u2019s not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it\u2019s about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There\u2019s a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.",

Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.",
        "I\u2019ve written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine.  Umm hmm.",

        "Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?",
        "Irrelevant.",
        "OK, I\u2019m going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?",
        "My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody\u2019s golden ticket idea.  That\u2026",

        "Yes I do. You\u2019ve just never seen it.  March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.",
        "Why do you have a diary?",
        "OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.",
        "Yes, you did.",
        "What are you writing?",
        "Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?",
        "We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you\u2019re thinking\u2013",
        "Umm, nacho chips.",
        "Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.",
        "Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what\u2019s the point? You\u2019re cooped up in there all day. You don\u2019t get to do your farming. You\u2019re not dating Angela anymore. It doesn\u2019t matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn\u2019t matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.",

        "May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.",
        "Yes they are, you just don\u2019t care about the information.",
        "He doesn\u2019t love it that much. Wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing for him to be fired.",
        "I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion\u2026",
        "Right.",
        "That\u2019s it. That\u2019s it. You can\u2019t put a price on freedom.",
        "That\u2019s why you made the decision. That\u2019s why you made\u2026",
        "You kind of have.",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in\u2014 what\u2019s it gonna be, what are you gonna do?  What\u2019s it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight?  Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.",
        "Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn\u2019t it?",
        "Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How\u2019d you come up with that idea?",
        "Really? How did\u2013 how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?",
        "Give me the details of how that happened.",
        "What?",
        "David? David?",
        "David?",
        "Could I be a part of the meeting also?",
        "There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It\u2019s called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.",
        "I can\u2019t\u2026 vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.",
        "OK, here\u2019s what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it\u2019s a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?",
        "Oh how dare you.",
        "You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It\u2019s a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?",

        "Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.",
        "When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that\u2019s what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.",

        "Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?",
        "Obviously.",
        "Oh, agreed, mmm, except\u2026",
        "Hey hey\u2026 what\u2019s up Chuck?",
        "No I\u2019m staying.",
        "Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying \u201cDunder Mifflin\u201d at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?",
        "You\u2026 oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk.",
        "This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.",
        "Before you got here, I\u2019m the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  I\u2019m on it, don\u2019t worry.  So, how do I do that?",
        "Can\u2019t I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "I\u2019m starting my own paper company.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.  In all climates.  It\u2019s going to be worldwide.  And I\u2019m looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That\u2019s where you come in.",
        "Can you believe it? Well, we\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so",
        "Potential, lots of potential. yes.",
        "It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s very courageous, very exciting. Um\u2026",
        "That\u2019s what I was thinking, with the farm, so\u2026 You getting to wherever I\u2019m gonna put my thing.",
        "So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.",
        "I made it sterile.",
        "I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.",
        "No, no no.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You don\u2019t have to convince me.",
        "Stanley?",
        "Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don\u2019t have to answer me now.",
        "Just\u2026 I want you to think about it, I\u2019m starting my own company.",
        "Oh-okay, you\u2019re not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.",
        "You know what.  I had a great time at prom.  And no one said \u2018Yes\u2019 to that either.",
        "Hmm?",
        "Okay, I have immunity. It\u2019s my two-weeks\u2026",
        "Hank?  You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you?  Hank, please escort Charles from the building.",
        "Well here we are\u2026 I would just like to\u2026",
        "Alright then everybody, I\u2019m outta here!",
        "\u2026 and I feel free!",
        "Shh shh shh\u2026 don\u2019t look down, look straight up. Come on please!",
        "Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.",
        "I was going to, I wanted to.  But I had to start somewhere.",
        "No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?",
        "So which way are you leaning?",
        "Thanks Jim.",
        "Okay, Okay, we don\u2019t have much time.  Just act normal.  Don\u2019t look at me people. Stop.  Don\u2019t look down. Don\u2019t look down. He\u2019s going to see me.  Don\u2019t look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height.  Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future.  Hello, I am your future.

        "Oh God\u2026 okay alright. It\u2019s time to go it\u2019s time to go. Jim, let\u2019s go. Come on!",
        "I think maybe Hank should be here.",
        "You\u2019re going to mess with me, is that what you\u2019re going to do? I\u2019ll tell you something Charles, I don\u2019t even care. Cause I\u2019ve got nothing got lose.  Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it\u2019s not even worth it.",
        "You are?",
        "Okay.  It\u2019s going to be great.",
        "Right\u2026 Executive assistant.",
        "Alright, okay.  Deal! Okay, well\u2026 Jim?",
        "Well, okay, lets go.",
        "Are people watching?",
        "Jim Jim Jim\u2026 we\u2019re having a company meeting here.",
        "Bye.",
        "Oh, good. My hooker\u2019s here.  Hi.",
        "Yes I was. Yes I was.",
        "That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.",
        "Thank you. Would you like some french toast?",
        "What shape?",
        "Alright.",
        "After breakfast.",
        "So how you feeling about the new company?",
        "You excited? About the new company?",
        "After breakfast.",
        "No, I\u2019m whipping them.",
        "Just let go.",
        "Let go, please. Just gimmee \u2013",
        "I can\u2019t do this! This is pathetic, isn\u2019t it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.",
        "I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.",
        "I\u2019m not overwhelmed, Pam.",
        "Don\u2019t patronize me, Pam.",
        "I\u2019m not getting dressed. I\u2019m not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.",
        "It\u2019s totally impossible!",
        "Assemble a sales team. A dream team.",
        "Okay, Ryan.",
        "He\u2019s everything I\u2019m not and everything I am. He\u2019s the whole package.",
        "Umm\u2026 Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I\u2019ve ever met.",
        "He worked at that telemarketing place.",
        "Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.",
        "Yeah, I guess it\u2019s not so bad. Got a few things cookin\u2019.  Umm\u2026",
        "Alright.",
        "Oh. Wow. \u201cMichael Scott Paper Company.\u201d Okay. Very official. \u201cDear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.\u201d",
        "How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?",
        "Okay. Okay. \u201cAchey Breaky Fart.\u201d",
        "No! No No. No. \u201cMy Stumps.\u201d Like \u201cMy Humps\u201d but a guy with no legs.",
        "We can do this.",
        "Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you\u2019ll excuse me, be right back.  Ah, okay.",
        "Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please.  It\u2019s Michael.",
        "Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.",
        "Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.",
        "I\u2019m\u2026",
        "Excuse me. Yes?",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "Yes.",
        "It is.",
        "Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance.  Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?",
        "Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?",
        "Uh, nine.",
        "Look what he\u2019s doing.",
        "He\u2019s stealing them. Okay, okay.",
        "He\u2019s already paying for himself.",
        "Right here.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Sounds awesome.",
        "People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana\u2019s investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what she would have wanted. Does want.",
        "Well I\u2019m sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey!  I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania \u2013 Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a \u2013 stay standing \u2013 from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.",
        "Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.",
        "By wanting it more. By working hard-",
        "Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.",
        "And I offer same day, free delivery.",
        "Nana.  I really think that Papa would want you to do this.",
        "Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other\u2026",
        "Well\u2026 this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup.  Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don\u2019t have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "Blech.",
        "Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that\u2019s why God made so many.",
        "Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let\u2019s get you out of the car. Alright.  Okay\u2026",
        "I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That\u2019s what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.",
        "So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or\u2026 that\u2019s it. That\u2019s our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don\u2019t believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I\u2019m gonna go inside. I\u2019m going to make some calls, I\u2019m gonna get us an office space, and I\u2019m going to show you why you joined this company. Okay?",
        "You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There\u2019s gotta be some sort of secret office that you have\u2026 lurkin\u2019 around\u2026 some awesome, free, keep it off the books\u2026 Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.",
        "I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That\u2019s what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don\u2019t think a woman can be a man? Well, then that\u2019s your stereotype, not mine.",
        "Okay.",
        "It\u2019s right in the middle of the paper belt.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m good. You good?",
        "You know what they say, keep your friends close.",
        "Yes, I am, Charles.",
        "Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol\u2019 can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin.  Actually a six pack. We\u2019re gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.",
        "It\u2019s Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.   Okay. Not gonna make this one.",
        "Hello! They took away my parking space but they can\u2019t take away my pride!",
        "I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey.  Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!",
        "We are in the heart of it.  And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.",
        "We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.",
        "I don\u2019t know I think we\u2019ve done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I\u2019ve updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.",
        "I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service.",
        "Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.",
        "Hey Ryan?  Could you get to that copy from before?",
        "Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don\u2019t make copies, I\u2019m the boss. Got it? I make originals.",
        "Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!",
        "Would someone just make the copy?",
        "Just make that copy okay?",
        "They\u2019re getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he\u2019s too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.",
        "I\u2019m on the phone, please. Mom, I\u2019m gonna have to call you back. P\u2019s being a giant B.",
        "They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?",
        "Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.",
        "Okay. There are \u2026 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.",
        "Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?",
        "No, you\u2019re supposed to say, \u201cRock the house.\u201d",
        "That\u2019s my corner.",
        "No, this is where I work. I can\u2019t relax in the same corner where I work.",
        "Pam, I don\u2019t make the rules.",
        "Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.",
        "Thank you. You remember Ryan  And Pam is around here somewhere.",
        "What for?",
        "Yes.",
        "Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That\u2019ll show \u2019em.",
        "Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary.  Young sir, would you like a free pancake?",
        "Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you\u2019re the face of this company.",
        "Hey Pam.",
        "You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well, at least you\u2019re still being honest with me.",
        "These are shaped like paper.",
        "I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting.  It is a disgusting sandwich.  And the reason I tell you this story.  Pick up the phone.",
        "Don\u2019t tell them we have free delivery!",
        "They don\u2019t know that!",
        "Give him a guarantee.",
        "Just say the word.",
        "Yes!",
        "You did!",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "She did it!",
        "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!",
        "Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don\u2019t have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really  Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what\u2019s important.",
        "Hup!",
        "Hup!",
        "Hey.",
        "Is this good?",
        "Oh. Okay. Ed\u2019s Tires, huh?",
        "I really appreciate it.",
        "It\u2019s for your trouble.",
        "No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "That was four years ago. Why don\u2019t you let it go?",
        "Ed\u2019s Tires. Why don\u2019t you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.",
        "That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?",
        "Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.",
        "Bring it in. Morning cheer.",
        "I need you to get me the prices that you\u2019re charging Ed\u2019s tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.",
        "Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?",
        "I\u2019m not following you.",
        "Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I\u2019m getting your drift.",
        "Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you\u2019re writing?",
        "Can I use it?",
        "Dwight, are you talking about us?",
        "Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?",
        "So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don\u2019t you?",
        "Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?",
        "Dwight?",
        "Is the cool new guy Charles?",
        "Is it Stanley?",
        "Hello, Dwight. What\u2019s with the shirt? Are you alright?",
        "Oh my God! Run! Run! It\u2019s a setup. Setup!",
        "Dwight, run!",
        "You be cool.",
        "Just-what\u2019s going on?",
        "Mm-do\u2026 Dwight would not-",
        "I. Understand. Nothing.",
        "Wow.",
        "It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.",
        "It\u2019s like, a girl says she\u2019ll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.",
        "I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don\u2019t know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don\u2019t know. Is that clear enough for you?",
        "Hello, traitor.",
        "I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.",
        "I\u2019m just getting hardcore with him.",
        "Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.  Bill Cosby.",
        "Is Mr. Schofield there?",
        "Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me\u2026 Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes.  Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?",
        "Wow. High score?",
        "Hello, Dwight, I\u2019ve been expecting your call. What do you want?",
        "So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?",
        "No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There\u2019s no-",
        "Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.",
        "Toward the sun.",
        "Noon.",
        "You have two seconds.",
        "Dwight.",
        "I hope you\u2019re not recording this conversation.  Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.",
        "So you just rat me out? You could have said no.",
        "If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.",
        "I do too.",
        "Cooper\u2019s.",
        "Damn it.",
        "Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?",
        "Really? That\u2019s weird. We didn\u2019t see any.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He\u2019ll be here in a sec.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Dwight, not now, we\u2019ve been robbed.",
        "No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You\u2019re still stuck in traffic.  You?",
        "What about our truce?",
        "On purpose?",
        "Why?",
        "Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.",
        "Oh.  Bastard!",
        "Dwight, do you mind if we talk?",
        "If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.",
        "Oh, one more thing. I\u2019m going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.",
        "Oh, uh oh, I\u2019m turning you down right now.",
        "You can hear me, but I can\u2019t hear you.",
        "Oh, great. Mr. Schofield\u2019s ready to see me. Thank you so much.",
        "Walking in the door\u2026",
        "Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I\u2019m closing the door.",
        "Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.",
        "Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.",
        "What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?",
        "That\u2019s very rude.",
        "I\u2019m going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin\u2026",
        "Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.",
        "That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.",
        "Good, good, good. I will see you.",
        "I color code all my info. I wrote \u201cgay son\u201d in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means \u201cOrange you glad you didn\u2019t bring it up?\u201d Most colors mean \u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d",
        "I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn\u2019t feel as important though. That\u2019s just how the world works, I guess.",
        "He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can\u2019t make you feel good, then I don\u2019t want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.",
        "Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.",
        "He\u2019s undercutting us big time. He\u2019s actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.",
        "Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.",
        "Betrayal ain\u2019t just a river in Egypt.",
        "It\u2019s 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan\u2019s parents or Pam\u2019s parents or my parents, you do.  They\u2019re gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.",
        "Time to make the donuts.   Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won\u2019t do it again.  Come on.   De-nied!",
        "Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!   Hey Pam.",
        "Milk and sugar.",
        "That\u2019s what I said.",
        "Every morning.",
        "We\u2019re, uh, we\u2019re doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we\u2019re having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20\u2013 of those.",
        "You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.",
        "Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.",
        "Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.",
        "Most do in the magazines.",
        "We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.",
        "How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?",
        "They are correct, sir.",
        "Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.",
        "Lowest in town.",
        "Okay, sure. Right, so\u2013 why don\u2019t you explain what that is to\u2013 so that they can under\u2013 just explain what that is.",
        "Explain that.",
        "Well, we don\u2019t\u2013",
        "Whatever, yeah.",
        "Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.",
        "Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.",
        "Just crunch \u2019em.  Just crunch \u2019em please.",
        "Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing.  Um, I\u2019m going to have to\u2026 ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we\u2019re just going to need a much, much bigger check.",
        "Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?",
        "I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It\u2019s this.",
        "I would love that.",
        "Was it nice?",
        "I love Pad Thai.",
        "No.  There\u2019s a lot I haven\u2019t done.",
        "Hmm?",
        "We\u2019re not hiring, Jim.",
        "Listen, I can\u2019t make you laugh right now.",
        "Jim, what you don\u2019t understand is that this company\u2019s worthl\u2013",
        "No\u2013 We don\u2019t have\u2013",
        "Uh\u2026 Yes.",
        "Yes, well, we\u2019re not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.",
        "That\u2019s a pun.",
        "Yep. Oh\u2026 wow.",
        "Of course not.",
        "Nope, nope, nope.",
        "Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we\u2019re broke.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m really worried that I\u2019m going to say it.",
        "Ah\u2026",
        "I\u2019m good, I\u2019m good.",
        "It is.  I\u2019m good.",
        "Hello.",
        "Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we\u2019re expected.   Well, well, well. How the turntables\u2026",
        "And we are prepared to reject that offer.",
        "Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?",
        "Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don\u2019t even want to hear what your first offer was.",
        "I\u2019ll see your situation and I\u2019ll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you\u2019re going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don\u2019t think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.",
        "We\u2019ll have to talk\u2013",
        "Just amongst ourselves.",
        "Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",
        "We are so rich.",
        "No.",
        "It\u2019s a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn\u2019t you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?",
        "Agreed?",
        "Shut up, shut up.  Hello?",
        "I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.",
        "And I want Charles gone.",
        "I need him gone.",
        "Okay, then I want Pam back.",
        "Sales.",
        "Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it\u2019s heyday.",
        "And Ryan.",
        "You know, David.  I don\u2019t care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.",
        "And dental this time.",
        "These are our demands.",
        "Our company is worth nothing.  That\u2019s the difference between you and I.  Business isn\u2019t about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.",
        "That\u2019s one of \u2019em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.",
        "Can we have the room please?",
        "Yes! Can you believe it?  That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!",
        "There are certain defining moments in a person\u2019s life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don\u2019t even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.",
        "No, no. You\u2019re done.",
        "Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he\u2019s back.  Who could it be? I\u2019ll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?",
        "It\u2019s Michael Scott.   Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.",
        "Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.   And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I\u2019m going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.",
        "If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.",
        "Yes.",
        "Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.",
        "When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.",
        "Oscar, what were you going to say?",
        "All right.",
        "Not important.  Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.",
        "It\u2019s going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and\u2013",
        "No, you lost those clients.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It\u2019s a trash can.",
        "There you are, my friend.",
        "Pamela.",
        "Yep.",
        "I know.",
        "I do?  Well\u2013Where is that bowl?",
        "Michael Scott Paper Company only.",
        "Okay, well\u2014",
        "I will\u2013no, no.  I\u2019ll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.",
        "Against who?",
        "The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.",
        "Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.",
        "That was  us, right there.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah, the Commish.",
        "Yeah, yeah. The Shield.",
        "Hey gang. Where you been?",
        "Where\u2019d you eat?",
        "What\u2019d you have, Stanley?",
        "So since you guys already ate, you won\u2019t be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?   Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.",
        "Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?",
        "I\u2019m going to o have some of this meat sandwich.",
        "Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?",
        "Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.",
        "Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.",
        "Who quits?",
        "You guys gotta be kidding.",
        "I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, I\u2019m going to give you some seed money.   There you go.  There\u2019s some seed money for you.  And you can take it, no hard feelings.  But if you stay, I want an apology,  and I want a big one.",
        "Yes I do.",
        "It\u2019s frontward\u2019s.",
        "No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view\u202698 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I\u2019m the bad guy.",
        "I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.",
        "Whatever you guys did earlier.",
        "Just do it, okay?",
        "Get \u2019em there.  Get \u2019em there.",
        "Are you kidding me?",
        "Okay, okay, okay.",
        "So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.",
        "If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  \u201capology accepted\u201d, I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you\u2013complimentary white chocolate bark.",
        "They wouldn\u2019t make it unless people liked it.",
        "Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won\u2019t be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.",
        "Fine, have your clients.  I can see that\u2019s what you wanted all along.   However, I rescind my apology.",
        "You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.",
        "Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?",
        "And Bingo was his name.  Let\u2019s go.",
        "I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.",
        "You\u2019re close with Pam too.",
        "Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he\u2019s my number one choice.",
        "I like his hair.",
        "Okay.",
        "That sounds pretty biased.",
        "Okay. Pam, pros.",
        "I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn\u2019t always follow through.  Sh\u2013New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.",
        "I don\u2019t need to tell you that.",
        "I don\u2019t think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven\u2019t said one bad thing about Pam.",
        "Okay.  So be it, then you\u2019ve lost credibility.  And I\u2019m going to go with my guy, and that\u2019s Ryan.",
        "Oh, wow!  Whoa!",
        "Ho-ho, man!  Wow.  Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  \u2018Cause I\u2019m not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba\u2013",
        "I have a very difficult decision to make.  It\u2019s like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie\u2019s Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.",
        "Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.   Well, there\u2019s no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just\u2026drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been\u2013",
        "I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren\u2019t enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to\u2013",
        "I\u2019m sorry, sorry.",
        "Yes, you did.",
        "Yep.",
        "No, you\u2013no.",
        "No, you\u2019re the best person for the job.  You\u2019re going to be great.",
        "Oh, oh!",
        "You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.",
        "Oh, really?",
        "Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.",
        "I don\u2019t know, I offered him his temp job back.  We\u2019ll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn\u2019t get the job, so\u2013",
        "I don\u2019t appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.",
        "Oh! What\u2019s our receptionists name?",
        "Could you send her in?",
        "Hello.",
        "Have a seat.",
        "This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.   Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard\u2013",
        "He will be ushering you out.",
        "Oh, your face!  Oh!",
        "No, I\u2019m kidding.  No, you\u2019re not\u2013you\u2019re not fired.  Yet.",
        "Oh\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t know, actually.",
        "Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate \u2013 it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.",
        "Guys, I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m really scared. I think I\u2019m growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?",
        "Okay. How about a woman? Pam?",
        "Oh, really? Ok.",
        "What about the rest of you?",
        "At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don\u2019t know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.",
        "Who else? Who else? Ryan?",
        "Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.",
        "What?",
        "Ugh! God! What happened to you people?  We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work\u2026 is work.",
        "I\u2026 was just learning\u2026 to\u2026 love.",
        "No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.",
        "That\u2019s good.",
        "If you ever want to come down here, door\u2019s always open, lock\u2019s broken, so\u2026",
        "Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.",
        "Now you got it.",
        "Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?",
        "You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.",
        "Ok. I love it. I love it.",
        "I love it.",
        "Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There\u2019s no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.",
        "Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster\u2019s People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like  Dave died or something.",
        "Daddy\u2019s here and daddy is going to take care of you.",
        "I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.",
        "Andy\u2019s afwaid?",
        "Are you all afwaid?",
        "Daddy\u2019s here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.",
        "Funk is the problem and the solution.",
        "I\u2019ve taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.",
        "Why don\u2019t you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.",
        "No. Dwight is confusing you. That \u2013 it\u2019s, it\u2019s more of a disco.",
        "\u2026 with coffee but without the haunted.",
        "It\u2019s a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Wha \u2013 No. No. Not even close. I can\u2019t force you to go down but I can entice you. I\u2019m gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time\u2026 and all-you-can-eat espresso.",
        "Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.",
        "Holdin\u2019 down the fort.",
        "Thank you.",

        "I don\u2019t need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?",
        "It\u2019s just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.",
        "Alright. Here we go.",
        "You having fun?",
        "What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we\u2019re going to put you in here. Dwight\u2019s going to take care of you.",
        "Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.",

        "Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don\u2019t think she would trade that memory for anything.",
        "You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?",
        "I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.",
        "I don\u2019t care. Bury it. I hope you\u2019re happy.",
        "I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.",
        "Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.",

        "Would you like to dance?",
        "My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would\u2026.fall down. But then\u2026he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He\u2026stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don\u2019t want that to happen to you guys. I\u2019m not gonna let it happen.",

        "Uh oh. What\u2019s so funny?",

        "All right. Mmhmm.  Hey.",
        "A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.",
        "Hey.  Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.",
        "Okay.",
        "You can go to hell.  I\u2019m kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.",
        "I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I\u2019m going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: \u201cHolly, you and I are soup snakes.\u201d The-and the reason is\u2026 because\u2026 in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn\u2019t make any sense. We\u2019re soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.",

        "Cool. For who?",

        "All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.",
        "You bet your fat ass we are.",
        "Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.",
        "That\u2019s right.",
        "Newspapers for sale!",
        "I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.",
        "What?",
        "Um, no, I just thought we\u2019d wing it. That cool?",

        "Probably shouldn\u2019t have mentioned Buffalo.",
        "Should\u2019ve had hindsight.",
        "I think it went well. I think it was good.",
        "No, it was a tough audience.",
        "Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.",
        "Me too.  We have a lot of good material for next year\u2019s sketch.",

        "Good to see you.  AJ.",
        "I didn\u2019t find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and\u2026 Maybe one year she\u2019ll be with somebody, and the next year, I\u2019ll be with somebody, and it\u2019s gonna take a long time\u2026 And then it\u2019s perfect. I\u2019m in no rush.",

        "Eric likes Megan.",
        "How do you know this?",
        "I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it\u2019s not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn\u2019t exist. Or that the sport doesn\u2019t exist? I should\u2019ve known. Poopball?",
        "Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said \u201cThe third wheel is what makes it a tricycle.\u201d",

        "Yes",

        "Nothing? Well I got a little somethin\u2019 somethin\u2019. I don\u2019t know if I should say\u2026",
        "Stanly is having a midlife crisis.",
        "Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.",
        "Who?",
        "",
        "You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.",

        "Stanley is having an affir.",
        "I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody\u2019s attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.",
        "That and that are the same letter.",
        "No\u2026 no. He\u2019s holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What\u2019s that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven\u2019t you guessed?",
        "T! Yes! Yes! That is a \u201cT\u201d, and there\u2019s another one right there. Just sound that out. You\u2019re almost there.",
        "Hey, Stanley! Where you goin\u2019, big guy? Up to no good?",
        "No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I\u2019m casting a movie and I\u2019m looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?",
        "Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.",
        "Did you hear Stanley\u2019s having an affair?",
        "Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it\u2019s really sad because everybody thinks you\u2019re a loser\u2026",
        "",
        "Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real.  Stanley, are you having an affair?",
        "So It\u2019s not true. Okay, well\u2026 ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just\u2026 racial profiling gossip.",
        "So stupid!",
        "I know, I know.",
        "Oh, I bet.",
        "Wait, hold, hold, hold\u2026 so it IS true?",
        "Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they\u2019re going on sales calls and then go someplace else? \u2018Cause that\u2019s not cool.",
        "I\u2019m not saying\u2026 a damn thing.",
        "You can count on me.",
        "Oh, that smells good.",
        "Did you hear about Angela? That\u2019s pretty weird.",
        "Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno\u2019s on the turnpike.",
        "Uh huh.  Alright?",
        "How do you un-tell something? You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that\u2019s been said is untrue, including \u201cStanley is having an affair.\u201d It\u2019s like the end of Spartacus. I\u2019ve seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don\u2019t know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Anorexia. She\u2019s an anorexatic.",
        "Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.",

        "Mm hmm.",
        "Did you hear Pam is pregnant?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Guys, guys\u2026 you can\u2019t believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It\u2019s just\u2026 there\u2019s no stalking it. It\u2019s a weird day for false facts. Let it go.",
        "Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff\u2026 who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.",
        "Yeah, yeah\u2026 you know what? Let\u2019s discredit these rumors.",
        "That\u2019s not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn\u2019t listen to any of that crap.",
        "",
        "Nowhere.",
        "",
        "Okay, I made it all up.",
        "Yes.",
        "But guys, I\u2019m a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I\u2019m a J. Crew model.",
        "Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.",
        "Because a lot of people think that models, even though they\u2019re very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It\u2019s set our industry back quite a bit.",
        "Okay, okay\u2026 here\u2019s the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn\u2019t want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.",
        "The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person\u2019s life, is that\u2026",
        "Alright, alright\u2026 you know, this is not the truth, and you can\u2019t fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.",
        "Yes. Jim\u2026",
        "Look at that!  That is the inside of your vagina!",
        "How long have you known about the pregnancy?",
        "A week? A month? A year?",
        "Did you pee on a stick?",
        "You should\u2019ve told me.",
        "",
        "",
        "Oh, oh\u2026 yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh\u2026 oh God.",
        "No, I have to take it, or it\u2019ll seem suspicious.",
        "No, no, I can do this.",
        "Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won\u2019t talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.",
        "Hey, what up, Cynthia?",
        "Hold on a second, Cynthia.",
        "Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly.  Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So\u2026 you can\u2019t stop love, I guess  and quite frankly, I don\u2019t think you should ever try.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.",
        "I\u2019m going in for a procedure today.",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s routine.  I\u2019m just a little bit scared.",
        "It is a colonoscopy.",
        "In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?  Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?",
        "My main concern, should I have a safe word?",
        "Abso\u2026 you know what? I\u2019ll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.",
        "Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I\u2019m gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you\u2019ll get it Weds.",
        "Oh right, this thing. I remember now.    What\u2019s this about?",
        "It\u2019s okay with me but he\u2019s gonna want me in there.",
        "Really?",
        "Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I\u2019m gonna blow my brains out.",
        "Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off\u2026 to the bathroom\u2026 while the other two have a secret meeting.",
        "Hey let me escort you to your desk.",
        "You and Jim are close, huh?",
        "Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you\u2026",
        "Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.",
        "If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That\u2019s how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.",
        "I just don\u2019t want you to lie to me.  I don\u2019t want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?",
        "I just don\u2019t want you to.",
        "Uh huh, well if he doesn\u2019t like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, I\u2019m going into a meeting right now.  I will\u2026 I love you too.  Bye.",
        "Sorry about that.  What\u2019d I miss?",
        "Do not mind!  Yes, I do!  No, I don\u2019t.  Yes, I do!  No, I don\u2019t mind.  Catch you guys on the flippity flop.  Oh this\u2026 call waiting.   Yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Nope.",
        "No, I think they\u2019re talking about me.",
        "What is Jim telling him?  That I can\u2019t handle this job?  That \u2018s bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve\u2026 I left my cell phone here.",
        "How are your sales doin\u2019?",
        "Shhh, I\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on in that room, okay?",
        "Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I\u2019m completely overwhelmed.",
        "You know when they say it\u2019s so crazy it just might work?  Well, I don\u2019t believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.",
        "Be my eyes.",
        "Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin\u2019?",
        "Yes, definitely.",
        "Look who you\u2019re talking to.",
        "Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.",
        "Permission to speak on the record?",
        "Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I don\u2019t think so.  Because Big Bird doesn\u2019t make the tough decisions.  I\u2026 If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.",
        "Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it\u2019s his performance report\u2026 right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.   David",
        "It\u2019s not very well written, but you get the gist.",
        "I can just continue to run it myself.",
        "This was Jim\u2019s idea?",
        "Wow.  Ummm, well I\u2019d have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.",
        "I can\u2019t help but feel partially responsible.",

        "Well we did talk about how handsome you are.",
        "Oh what a week, God.  We said\u2026 I know there were certain things we said\u2026",
        "Hmmm, that\u2019s weird, that\u2019s weird\u2026 it\u2019s kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincoln\u2019s secretary was named Kennedy.",
        "Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.",
        "Yes!",
        "Yes.",
        "Hey David, this is Michael Scott.    Michael Scott here.",
        "Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.",
        "Wha\u2026 here\u2019s the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.",
        "Well, nnnn, that\u2026 that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.",
        "Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.",
        "I never recommended you because I didn\u2019t want to lose you and I didn\u2019t want to lose Pam,  and now I don\u2019t wanna lose the baby.",

        "Kind of in the middle of something here.",
        "I, yeah\u2026 no, I\u2019ll tell him myself.  Let\u2019s both.",
        "Hello.",
        "No, it\u2019s just us.",
        "Oh, oh, well here he is right now.    Come in.",
        "Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.",
        "I like that, so manager and co-manager.",
        "Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.",
        "Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make\u2026 whoa do you have an announcement?",
        "Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.",
        "Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.",
        "What\u2019s happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.",
        "No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim\u2019s now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.",
        "That is not big picture.",
        "\u2026 Okay.",
        "That is not\u2013 okay\u2013 that is day-to-day.",
        "You\u2019re trying to trick me.",
        "Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",
        "Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I\u2019d like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.",
        "Yes?",
        "Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?",
        "Welcome.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Disruptive.",
        "No, I don\u2019t think they are. I think the meetings are very important.",
        "Let\u2019s do.",
        "N\u2013 well, to be fair, Jim\u2026 James\u2026 Jimothy\u2026 To be fair, Jimothy, the\u2013 ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?",
        "Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn\u2019t about planets\u2026",
        "At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.",
        "Because it\u2019s a big universe, and we\u2019re all just little, tiny specks of dust.",
        "You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it\u2019s light out, you wake up, it\u2019s dark. That\u2019s the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",
        "Yes.",
        "Alright. No more meetings this week.",
        "I can be very suprising.",
        "Mm-hmm?",
        "Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.",
        "Stanley, you don\u2019t need to answer that.",
        "What do you mean by \u201cthese people\u201d?",
        "Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.",
        "Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.",
        "What do you guys think?",
        "No, no, no, you don\u2019t need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.",
        "That is not what Wallace told us.",
        "That is not the way I heard it.",
        "It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.",
        "No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace.  I will call David Wallace.",
        "Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don\u2019t we just\u2013",
        "Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.",
        "Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.",
        "Which is it more of?",
        "I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.",
        "No, it will not be. I am on top of it.",
        "Talk to you later\u2013  Okay, you didn\u2019t let me say good-bye.  Alright, I am looking forward to this.",
        "I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don\u2019t see you anymore.",
        "All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.",
        "You know, there\u2019s no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don\u2019t say anything about it.",
        "No, we can do it during the day. It doesn\u2019t have to be that dramatic, Jim.",
        "Jim, don\u2019t take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",
        "You use your brain too much.",
        "Sometimes the smartest people don\u2019t think at all.",
        "As I was saying it.",
        "Con\u2013 you look like a nerd.",
        "Pro\u2013 you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.",
        "Con\u2013 you unzip your pants, and you find that there\u2019s a calculator down there.",
        "That will not go over well.",
        "Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I\u2019m gonna kill myself.",
        "No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.",
        "And then another\u2013",
        "Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.",
        "Ha! That\u2013 I am not known for that!",
        "Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!",
        "Okay. Well, why don\u2019t you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don\u2019t you enliven me?",
        "Ah.",
        "Okay, here\u2019s a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!",
        "Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don\u2019t you run yourself out there and tell them?  You call it.",
        "This had better be terrible.",
        "That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it\u2019s hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This\u2013",
        "My plan\u2013 a man\u2013 panama.",
        "Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise?  Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we\u2019re going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.",
        "What about a raise based on merit?",
        "Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.",
        "Are you making a\u2013",
        "Toby.",
        "Just wanted to draw a picture of him.",
        "Alright! Who to pick?  Who to pick?",
        "I\u2026 will skip a turn.",
        "I need more time.",
        "Hey, what are you guys doing in here?",
        "",
        "How you doing?",
        "Oh, what are you usually?",
        "Usually a ten, but I\u2019m feeling like a zero.",
        "I know, I know.",
        "Yes, we did.",
        "Um, nothing. I just\u2026 I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "Gin.",
        "Just pretend we\u2019re not here.",
        "What do you think? I spent all morning on it.",
        "It\u2019s just a really important day for me.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Yes she does. Yes she does. We\u2019re all gonna go and we\u2019re gonna have a good time.",
        "No.",
        "And, hey, don\u2019t embarrass me when we go to Niagara.",
        "Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t. You stole my joke. Don\u2019t steal my joke.",
        "Yes. I said that yesterday.",
        "Dwight\u2026",
        "No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that\u2019s my joke.",
        "This is what I\u2019m talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So\u2026 I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!",
        "Pam and Jim\u2019s wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.",
        "Get out of here.",
        "Oh, my God, Dwight.",
        "There\u2019s\u2026 a name.",
        "Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.",
        "Is that all you have on her?",
        "You\u2019re an idiot.",
        "Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.",
        "Those glasses are super dark.",
        "Alright. We need some tunes, I think.",
        "You did?",
        "That was nice of you.",
        "Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.",
        "Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?",
        "No. No. That\u2019s not how it works.",
        "Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "I don\u2019t have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.",
        "Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.",
        "I\u2019m staying in your\u2013  Come on, Dwight.",
        "I would do the same for you.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes\u2026 just go\u2013",
        "Oh. Thank God.",
        "Um\u2026 no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can\u2019t. And I\u2019ll tell you why.",
        "If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she\u2019s going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.",
        "Ok.",
        "I don\u2019t have a room?",
        "Ok. \u2018Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.\u2019",
        "Jerk.",
        "When Mary was denied a room at the inn\u2026 Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don\u2019t know what happens because that story hasn\u2019t been told yet.",
        "Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?",
        "Not in the same bed. In the other bed.",
        "You\u2026 are\u2026 kidding me.",
        "I\u2019m not a physics major, Stanley. I\u2019m just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?",
        "That\u2019s rude.",
        "You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.",
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah. She\u2019s very conservative. So, mum\u2019s the word.",
        "How ya doin\u2019?",
        "Nice to meet you.",
        "Who\u2019s doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and\u2013",
        "That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.",
        "Didn\u2019t move my lips.",
        "Head table, where I belong.",
        "Well, who\u2019s that one?",
        "What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?",
        "They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me\u2026 up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.",
        "That\u2019s not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn\u2019t gonna make a toast and I\u2019m not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? \u2018I\u2019m so smart. E=mc\u2026 squared. I drive a Smart Car.\u2019 That\u2019s not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.",
        "That\u2019s a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.",
        "That\u2019s not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.",
        "And\u2026 you\u2026 everybody can laugh. It doesn\u2019t have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.",
        "Yeah. Go ahead.",
        "Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that\u2026 they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they\u2019re living together, they\u2019re having lots of consentual sex\u2013",
        "Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can\u2019t expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it\u2019s just a different sensation.",
        "When you c\u2013 well? Am I wrong? They say it\u2019s not different, but it\u2019s a different sensation.",
        "When you use something to block\u2013 I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It\u2019s not necessarily different for the woman\u2013",
        "\u2026but it\u2019s different for the\u2013 ok. Ok.",
        "Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.",
        "Jim.",
        "That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.",
        "I know. I can\u2019t believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.",
        "I have not found that to be the case.",
        "Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.",
        "There\u2019s gonna be a free room?",
        "Hi, Mema. It\u2019s Michael.",
        "Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?",
        "I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma\u2026 and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she\u2019s better than everybody.",
        "Oh. Ok. Well\u2026 hook you up, there.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "Oh. Isn\u2019t he terrible? May I? Here\u2019s the thing. Umm\u2026 Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It\u2019s not 1890 anymore. It\u2019s modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That\u2019s part of life.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I know.",
        "They\u2019re gonna name the baby after you, you know. They\u2019re gonna call it Mema.",
        "Yes, and if it\u2019s a boy they will call it Sylvio.",
        "What are you wearing?",
        "Looks like you\u2019re going to a fish fry, Dwight.",
        "Ok.  That\u2019s not appropriate.  Uncool. Uncool, Dwight.  Ok. Ok. Come on. Let\u2019s go.",
        "Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It\u2019s not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.",
        "Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.",
        "Yes.",
        "Why?",
        "Oh, my God. Twins. I\u2019m sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.",
        "They\u2019re men, Dwight.",
        "Something is wrong with you.",
        "Is that Pam?  Hey, have her come out!  Have her come out!  It would be like Coyote Ugly.",
        "I love you!",
        "Mmm!  It\u2019s after midnight.",
        "Oh my God.  You\u2019re not going to be able to talk back.",
        "She\u2019ll be sitting home saying, \u201cJim\u2026 take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons.\u201d   \u201cAnd\u2026 and clip my toenails.\u201d",
        "Now you sound like Kermit.",
        "Why don\u2019t you take a picture.  It\u2019ll last longer.  God.  Can\u2019t I get a little privacy?",
        "Hey, good morning.   It\u2019s about damn time.  I haven\u2019t gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.    Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.",
        "How can you eat like that?",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m hungry, but I\u2019m not going to make a pig out of myself.",
        "She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.",
        "She was from Europe.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "No.",
        "Wait a second.  You\u2019re not into her?  Are you kidding me?",
        "She\u2019s Pam\u2019s best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?",
        "No\u2026 you\u2019re crazy.",
        "She\u2019s\u2013 okay.  Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?  You have to take x-rays.  You have to scrape the plaque off of people\u2019s teeth.  You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they\u2019re not scared when the dentist comes in.  It\u2013 it\u2013",
        "I already have my European girlfriend.",
        "Oh, here we go.  They asked for cash, but you know\u2026 I give them cash every week, so\u2013 how much cash does a person need?  I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.  I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.    And I have another one of them in the nude.  But that one is for me.",
        "Hey, hey\u2026 He\u2019s not sitting with me either.  Where are you sitting?  You need a seat buddy?",
        "Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid.  Where am I gonna go?",
        "Hey.  Hi.  Do you\u2013would you have a snack in your purse?  You\u2019re a mom.  I just figured you might have\u2013",
        "Oh!  Eww\u2026 apricot.  Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or\u2013",
        "Oh\u2026 okay.  Were you saving it?",
        "I\u2019m sorry.  Ugh.  Apricot.  Made of real apes.",
        "my weekend was bad so far.",

        "And\u2026 and the love of my life is dating somebody else.",
        "It is a terrible year for love.",
        "I\u2019m thinking about having my sperm frozen.",
        "Oh, wow.  That sounds hilarious.  I do actually.   There you go.  Use it in good health.",
        "Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy\u2026  in my heart\u2026 right now.  How do I look?",
        "Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.",
        "The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. \u201cMental\u201d is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you\u2019re mental, if you don\u2019t have a good time. You have to enjoy it.",
        "Get out.",
        "Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake.  But you can\u2019t just go right to the selling, you need \u201csmall talk.\u201d  What topics can you use for small talk?",
        "Mmhm.",
        "Mmhm.",
        "Yes, what else?",
        "No.",
        "Yeah! That\u2019s good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let\u2019s do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, \u201cSo Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?\u201d",
        "All right\u2026",
        "Okay, okay. God. What you people don\u2019t know about business, I could fill a book with.",
        "What?",
        "The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I\u2019m not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman\u2026",
        "Oh hi. I\u2019m sorry, just a sec.  Erin, you\u2019re supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?",
        "Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.",
        "Push free play til tomorrow morning.  Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You\u2019re seeing how the sausage gets made.",
        "Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.",
        "Mmhm.",
        "Yep.",
        "Okay.",
        "There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It\u2019s like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.",
        "Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.",
        "Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.",
        "Okay, well.",
        "Do your worst.",
        "Oh, great.",
        "Mmhm.",
        "Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.",
        "No Dwight, not everything is a threat.",
        "There is no such things as monsters.",
        "Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.",
        "I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.",
        "He did talk about a fire in the warehouse\u2026  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.",
        "Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.  Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?",

        "Hello.  Scott.  Table for four.",
        "What table should we take?  So many to choose from.",
        "What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!",
        "Not about taking credit.  Let\u2019s just say we all did it.",
        "Well, it was actually me alone, so\u2013 wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.",
        "Oh. Thank you.  Thanks for lending me the books.",
        "That\u2019s funny.",
        "You\u2019re 54 years old.",
        "You\u2019re 58 years old?",
        "Congratulations.",
        "The only time you should care about a woman\u2019s age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.",
        "That\u2013",
        "Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?",
        "Helene?",
        "I am.  I\u2019m definitely going to do it.  I\u2019ve already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?",
        "So it\u2019s a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  It\u2019s not anything you would have ever done.",
        "Well there\u2019s no jumping in a triathlon.",
        "You\u2019re thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try\u2013 bungee jumping?",
        "Snowboarding?",
        "I might.",
        "Nothing.  Just life\u2013 and doing things\u2013 before you die. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.",
        "So we should get the check?",
        "Oh, no, no, no. No.  It\u2019s stupid.  You\u2019d hate it.  I hate it.",
        "Yes you will.",
        "I literally\u2013 I put no thought into the wrapping at all.  Might as well of been toilet paper.",
        "That\u2019s just an arbitrary title.",
        "It\u2019s not amazing\u2026 at all.  It\u2019s sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish won\u2019t come true, so that blows.",
        "Oh that I plagiarized I think.",
        "Well, that\u2019s because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  It\u2019s a generational\u2013 sort of gap between us.",
        "That was a bunt.",
        "Oh, just went to the bathroom.",
        "I got thirsty.",
        "Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly.  And then I met Helene.  And she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.  But, I think I want to do those things myself.",
        "Finish your cake, Helene.",
        "I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.",
        "Helene I think you\u2019re a wonderful person and I\u2013 God\u2013 I\u2019ve enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pam\u2019s feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.",
        "No it\u2019s not.",
        "Wow.  That just\u2013 you\u2019ve really grown.",
        "Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who\u2013 who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  I\u2019ve never\u2013 I don\u2019t know him.  There\u2019s another woman.  And her name is Italy\u2026 and skydiving\u2026 and bungee jumping.",
        "And I want kids.  And you\u2026 unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.",
        "It\u2019s not my decision.  It\u2019s mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer\u2013   \u2014 tility.",
        "Well, hobbies\u2013",
        "Pamela Beesly Halpert\u2013",
        "May I have a word with you in my office please?",
        "Well, this is a work related matter.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.  Join me please, won\u2019t you?   I am going to give you a raise.",
        "Because of all the good work you\u2019ve done.",
        "That\u2019s\u2013 no, no\u2013 it\u2019s not about numbers, Pam.  It\u2019s about attitude.",
        "Do you want the raise or what?",
        "Hey, Pam, Pam\u2013 with this raise there are strings attached.    And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.",
        "No!  No\u2013 no I am not.  Unless you want me to.  DO you want me to? Cause I will.  I will bribe you.  No.  Your face is saying don\u2019t\u2013 unless I haven\u2019t offered you enough\u2026 your face isn\u2019t changing.  What is it?  Talk to me face.  Tell me what Pam\u2019s brain is thinking.  Come on!  What do you want? What do you want?  Do you want a million dollars?  Do you want to hit me?  Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or\u2013",
        "What?",
        "Oh\u2013 okay , what? I don\u2019t\u2013 Are you kidding?",
        "Ye\u2013 No.  Alright.  I\u2019ll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just\u2013",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "See you.",
        "Hey.",
        "Never.  About what?  A little\u2013 what are you talking\u2013",
        "What punch?",
        "I\u2019m pretty sure we said slap.",
        "I\u2013 mmm\u2013 I\u2019m good.",
        "Hey.",
        "Do you and Pam ever get frisky?",
        "I mean\u2013 do you ever wrestle with each other?",
        "Really?",
        "She strong?",
        "Can you stop this?",
        "Okay.",
        "I don\u2019t either.",
        "Mmm-hmm.  I know.",
        "You gotta do something\u2013",
        "How much time do you think you\u2019ll need?",
        "Come on, man!",
        "Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdo\u2019s pay dominatrix\u2019s hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  I\u2019m scared I\u2019m gonna love it.   Let\u2019s do this.",
        "It\u2019s okay guys\u2026 I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.",
        "You\u2019re just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?",
        "Yes.",
        "I know.  Okay.  Alright.   Oh\u2013 God!",
        "Okay!  Pam, Pam\u2013 I\u2019m really sorry.  I\u2019m sorry.",
        "So many things.  I don\u2019t know.  It\u2019s hard to choose.",
        "Maybe that\u2013",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay.  I promise.   For the record your mom came on to me.",
        "No!",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "As I watched Pam\u2019s big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.  And my wife is a runner and it shows.  And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together.  And I am happy and I am rich and I never die.  It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but its enough for me.",
        "Ahh\u2026",
        "Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.",
        "No.",
        "What are you talking about\u2013",
        "Forget that.",
        "No.",
        "Oh that feels better.",
        "But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.",
        "You did?",
        "That sounds like it was hilarious.",
        "Yes?",
        "You\u2019ll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.",
        "Woo hoo, shout out!",
        "Erin, do we have the journal?",
        "Did you?",
        "Oh, the Wall.",
        "It\u2019s $1.99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was going to say?",
        "No, no, that doesn\u2019t make any sense.",
        "Oh, that sounds awful.",
        "Oh God.  Well, that\u2019s an interesting theory.",
        "Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.   Oh my God, wouldn\u2019t that be hilarious!",
        "OK, OK.  Good.  I\u2019ll catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye.   He\u2019s busy, he\u2019ll call me back when he\u2019s free.",
        "No, I\u2019m just poopin\u2019.  You know how I be.",
        "Crazy world.  Lotta smells.",
        "OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesn\u2019t even need to be good.  Oh God, I can\u2019t think, need more Mullins.",
        "Monkey see, monkey do.",
        "Monkey pee all over you.",
        "We have a monthly staff meeting",
        "What? Oh my God!    There has been a murder.  There\u2019s been a murder in Savannah.",
        "Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  Battleship got me through my parents\u2019 divorce.  Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.  I don\u2019t think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.",
        "It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it\u2026",
        "This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it\u2019s about murder.",
        "Tube City, you owe me one.",
        "There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.",
        "Sandwich platters.",
        "Baby carrots.",
        "OK, here are your character cards.  Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.  Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.  Everything else is up to your imagination.  So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.",
        "OK, use your imaginations.",
        "It\u2019s not scary.",
        "Well how do you think I feel?  I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy.  Every night, a different woman.  Being oogled.  Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.",
        "Well, well, well.  What is this contraption, I do declare?",
        "Who\u2019s Michael?  I\u2019m Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.",
        "That is the way Southern people talk.",
        "Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?",
        "No, no, no. Don\u2019t turn this into a political thing.",
        "Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!",
        "I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.",
        "Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.",
        "Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar.",
        "Whoa. What\u2019s this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This here\u2019s Savannah.",
        "No no no no no no no.  I\u2019m going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.",
        "Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that\u2019s a misdirection.  We still don\u2019t know who the murderer is.   Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can\u2019t do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju\u2026 what am I gonna do?",
        "I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y\u2019all skedaddled way too soon.  We need to reopen this case.",
        "No it ain\u2019t.",
        "I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.",
        "This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.",
        "You are out of order.",
        "You are-",
        "Deb, what in the world \u2013 do you have the vapors?",
        "Can\u2019t wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.",
        "To Mama Juju Boo Boo.",
        "Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.",
        "No Michael here, my name is-",
        "No, you shut up.  They need this game, Jim.  Let us have this stupid little game, alright?",
        "Oh, you startled me.  My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.  What can I do you for?",
        "Detective Wallace?",
        "Aw, shucks, tell him I\u2019m not here.",
        "No, I only answer to Detective Wallace \u2019cause I got a warm body in the other room.",
        "A murder, you say?  I do declare.",
        "Get in there!",
        "There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.   Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.",
        "On the count of three we\u2019re all going to put down our guns.",
        "We\u2019ll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?",
        "One, two, three..",
        "Ok. Ok. How \u2019bout this?",
        "I want it to be better than \u2018Great\u2019, Pam. How \u2019bout I remain seated\u2026 and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing.",
        "Nope. Then my face is down. They can\u2019t see my face.",
        "Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title\u2019s important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder\u2019s meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd\u2026 and the crowd goes wild.",
        "Ok. Obviously I\u2019m not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.",
        "I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It\u2019s not even a twirl, it\u2019s a spin. I might do the spin.",
        "Ok, Oscar, I don\u2019t need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.",
        "Well, could you condense it please?",
        "It\u2019s not a limo. It\u2019s a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.",
        "They sent a limo.",
        "Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they\u2019re in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.",
        "Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.",
        "Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.",
        "Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you\u2019re invited and you\u2019re invited and you\u2019re invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-",
        "What?",
        "The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.",
        "Mmm\u2026 whoa.",
        "I wish the windows weren\u2019t tinted so people could see us in here.",
        "Definitely.",
        "Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That\u2019s bigger than my bed.",
        "Who\u2019s playing with the button?",
        "I will have to answer.",
        "No, no. That\u2019s too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re sort of on thin ice.\u2019  I won\u2019t say that. I\u2019ll something like that.",
        "Oh, my god. This is it.",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "Well, thank you and, and please call \u2013 continue to call me Mr. Scott.",

        "See you later.",
        "Officers. Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hello.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Ah.  Your eminence.",
        "You guys ever protect the president?",
        "What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?",
        "Rock and roll.",
        "This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.",
        "We\u2019re going bankrupt, you think?  They are really angry.",
        "Hey, hey, hey. I\u2019m sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That\u2019s \u2013",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, well, that\u2019s not gonna happen. That\u2019s not gonna happen. We\u2019ll be back with some answers.  I \u2013 ok. I know that you\u2019re mad at me and you\u2019re mad at all them \u2013",
        "Ok. Alright. We are gonna \u2013 we\u2019re gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We\u2019re gonna come back with a plan for you. It\u2019s a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track.  45 points. It\u2019s a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business.  And you can take that to the bank.  And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral.  I love you, New York!  You. You.",
        "Wow. Things are really picking up.",
        "What?",
        "I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.",
        "We tell them the plan, right?",
        "Here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.",
        "Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.",
        "I am the guy who roused that crowd.",
        "Got them on their feet.",
        "They were so happy down there.",
        "Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.",
        "Well, I\u2019m texting him, so.",
        "It\u2019s done.",
        "Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don\u2019t be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don\u2019t you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away.",
        "Tell them what you told me. This is genius.",
        "Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and \u2013 this is all \u2013",
        "It\u2019s all good. It\u2019s all good stuff. Lay it on them.",
        "That wasn\u2019t what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.",
        "O-kay. Oh\u2026 hey, hey.  What are you doing?",
        "Wow, man. That \u2013",
        "That was embarrassing.",
        "For me, too. You embarrassed me.",
        "Well, that was a waste of a text. Let\u2019s get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don\u2019t seem to have a plan so I\u2019m thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.",
        "Uh, I\u2019m not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So\u2026 you\u2019re the moron.",
        "",
        "Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one\u2019s company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, \u2018Wow. Great job.\u2019  That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks.  Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we\u2019re leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.",
        "Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!",
        "Yeah, Have a seat.",
        "Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.",
        "I have it on good authority that you said the following.   Can you read that back to me?",

        "Keep.",
        "For what?",
        "Oh okay.  I don\u2019t know how those got on there\u2026",
        "Must be hackers.",
        "What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?",
        "Worse than that.",
        "Lurk much?   I miss Pam.",
        "Is that what we\u2019re going for now?  \u201cokay?\u201d  We used to go for \u201cpretty good.\u201d",
        "Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I\u2019m not in this for the trophies, but\u2026",
        "Well, technically, I\u2019m a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.",
        "It would look good, on my mantle.",
        "There you are.  I don\u2019t think we have finished with my Inbox.",
        "To change lives.",
        "Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can\u2019t go through with this.",
        "Well\u2026",
        "No.",
        "I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didn\u2019t want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  I\u2019ve made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.",
        "Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?",
        "I\u2019m not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids I\u2019d pay for college.  Okay, all right.",
        "Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of\u2026",
        "Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?",
        "Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?",
        "Good to see you.  Where\u2019s your saxaphone?",
        "Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.",
        "Well, you didn\u2019t even hear it.",
        "Oh, good.",
        "Sure.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "No, not at all.  Nope, come on.",
        "Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn\u2019t go in there.  I\u2019m pretty busy, I should just\u2026",
        "Oh.",
        "Wow!",
        "Oh, God.  Oh, God.",
        "All right.  Wow.  Um, I am never going to forget today.  Not a chance.  I don\u2019t think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today.  Who here has done something stupid in their lives?  Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between \u201cA\u201d gym and \u201cB\u201d gym, that sort of thing?  Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.  Well, me too, I\u2019ve done something stupid which I would like to share.  Ummm.  Should we go?",
        "Ah.  All right.  I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.  But you know what\u2019s invaluable is intuition.  You know what that is?  That is the ability to know when something is about to happen.  Does anybody out there have intuition?  Know what\u2019s gonna happen next?  Nobody?  Okay, you\u2019re going to make me say it.  All right, I am so proud of all of you.  Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?",
        "Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody\u2019s tuition.  I\u2019m so, so sorry.",
        "I\u2019m sorry.  I\u2019m sorry.  I\u2019m so sorry.",
        "I lied to myself too.  I\u2019m not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn\u2019t even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I don\u2019t know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.",
        "Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I can\u2019t pay for your college.  But you don\u2019t have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.  Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.",
        "Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They\u2019re lithium.",
        "Erin, can you give us a second?",
        "Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "What can I do?",
        "I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?",
        "Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?",
        "Really? Wow.  That\u2019s over $200 a year.",
        "For-okay, okay here\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do.  I\u2019m going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  I\u2019m going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause I\u2019ve got monies to move around.",
        "That\u2019s a lot of zeroes.",
        "Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.",
        "Yes.",
        "You\u2019re what, like, 12?",
        "I think you\u2019re doing a great job.",
        "What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn\u2019t go out of business?",
        "Really?",
        "You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.",
        "Yeah.  I just sort\u2019ve had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.",
        "Heeeeeere\u2019s Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see.",
        "What the hell is going on?",
        "Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?",
        "Phyllis?",
        "Take it back. That is absurd.",
        "No? No! Jim! Come on!",
        "It\u2019s insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn\u2019t it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!",
        "Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.",
        "If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she\u2019d ask you what you wanted, you would say probably \u201cfreedom.\u201d At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It\u2019s a good thing Russia doesn\u2019t exist anymore.",
        "Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only \u2026 pretending to be a man, I\u2019m the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!",
        "No it\u2019s not, not like penis-wise.  Hello little boy, what\u2019s your name?",
        "Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.",
        "Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go.  Oh my God.",
        "What would you like for Christmas little boy?",
        "What did you think was going to happen?",
        "All right, just say \u201csome toys\u201d please.",
        "Damn it Kevin, come on.",
        "Okay get off, get off!  Oh! Oh, God!",
        "Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn\u2019t have to go through this again.",
        "Ryan come here!",
        "Come on, come on.",
        "Ahhh\u2026 Ho ho ho!  Come on I need this. Come over here!",
        "Just sit down!",
        "Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!",
        "Whoop! Okay, what?",
        "Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!",
        "Do you understand, you forced my hand?",
        "Oh, do we? Do \u201cWe?\u201d Is that what \u201cwe\u201d want? Why don\u2019t \u201cwe\u201d take a vote on it?",
        "Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are\u2013",
        "No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we \u2013 Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?",
        "I\u2019ll get some punch. That looks delicious.",
        "I don\u2019t ask for much for Christmas, I really don\u2019t. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m begging people to buy me diamonds and \u2026broach pendants. \u201cOh buy me something expensive or I\u2019m gonna kill myself.\u201d  That\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don\u2019t look at me.",
        "Behold!  Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas.  Those of you who wish to join me, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m excited by that. And those of you who don\u2019t, I forgive you. But I never forget.",
        "Oh the Anti-Christ!",
        "Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you\u2019re saying?",
        "Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!",
        "Uh oh, what\u2019s Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?",
        "Oh yes. It\u2019s space garbage. Dwight\u2019s gonna be able to build himself a friend!  Deck the halls with crappy gifts\u2026",
        "Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery\u2019s a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What\u2019d you get?",
        "Oh, that\u2019s appropriate. Lot of fire where you\u2019re going. Better get used to it. You\u2019re going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You\u2019re going to Hell Stanley.",
        "I can\u2019t see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don\u2019t make me get up.",
        "That\u2019s fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.",
        "No!",
        "Andy had Erin.",
        "What? Was I not supposed to say it?  What? Turn it back on.",
        "David, guess who I\u2019m sitting here dressed as.",
        "I\u2019ll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.",
        "I\u2019m Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.",
        "What?",
        "Really? What\u2019s going on?",
        "What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?",
        "Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Well, can\u2019t Alan protect you?",
        "All of us?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that\u2019s one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.",
        "Hey. How\u2019s everybody doing?",
        "That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.",
        "You know what\u2019s even more offensive, is baling on this party because some\u2026  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here\u2019s my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.",
        "I don\u2019t want to say. But, \u201cit\u2019s fun to stay at the -\u201d",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s fun to stay at the -\u201c",
        "Mmm, mm mm mm.",
        "You know what, Christmas isn\u2019t about Santa, or Jesus. It\u2019s about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you\u2019re my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas.  And Stanley, you\u2019re our mailman. And I can\u2019t help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, \u201cHow could they do this to us?\u201d",

        "Well, you should have a little. But it\u2019s great that you don\u2019t, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of \u2019em.",
        "All of them.",
        "So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I\u2019m good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?",
        "Hello. No. My name\u2019s Michael Scott. Hello.",
        "Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.",
        "Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and \u2013",
        "Ok. I feel very strongly that you can\u2019t just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because\u2026 he knows. He\u2019d know what to do.",
        "I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.",
        "I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre.  He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is?  Hey. Hi, sorry.",
        "I hope you\u2019re not busy doing something.",
        "You sure?",
        "You look great too.",
        "Oh, yeah, that sounds good.",
        "Hey. Wow.",
        "Really loud.",
        "Wow. Oh, yummy.  You have got the life, my friend.",
        "Can I just stay here and never go back?",
        "Oh, man. How much time do you have?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I\u2019d come by, see\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "Sabre is changing everything.  Site blockers. They don\u2019t let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?",
        "Exactly. What are you thinking?",
        "It is a tough one.",
        "Yeah. But one would be good.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "So the kid\u2019s making the noise to pick it up.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "No, I think it is-",
        "Yep.",
        "The what?",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Like it.",
        "There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of \u2019em.",
        "See you later.",
        "Bye now.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Well, that\u2019s not the David Wallace that I remember.  That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace\u2019s house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.",
        "Hello.  Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe\u2019s homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.",
        "You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That\u2019s the best thing? Really? Ugh.",
        "Well, I\u2019m not really one for making speeches.",
        "But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.",
        "No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.",
        "Here\u2019s my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.",
        "Here\u2019s the toast. I\u2019m gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.",
        "Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That\u2019s like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn\u2019t it? Okay, anyway, welcome.",
        "Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America!  I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.",
        "Okey doke.",
        "What?",
        "No.",
        "No.  We\u2019re trying to look it up right now.",
        "Um, come on.",
        "Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I\u2019ve always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.",
        "Oh.",
        "That\u2019s it!",
        "Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.",
        "Okay, put it on my card.",
        "Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she\u2019s gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?",
        "Why hello!",
        "Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.",
        "Jo, I don\u2019t know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.",
        "Whoa, whoa!",
        "And sometimes I can hardly handle that!",
        "Forget the question\u2026",
        "I humbly accept the management position.",
        "Because, well, Jim. Where I\u2019m from, two types of folk: those who ain\u2019t, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain\u2019t you ain\u2019t? Ya\u2019ll come back now.",
        "Yes.",
        "No, we know. Texas!",
        "I could manage my way around that.",
        "I will try to manage my excitement!",
        "I have been saying the word \u201cmanager\u201d a lot, so whenever Jo thinks \u201cmanager\u201d she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can\u2019t even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.",
        "Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?",
        "What?",
        "What? Really?",
        "Wow!",
        "La la la, hello Oscar!",
        "What are you reading?",
        "Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can\u2019t keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.",
        "Why, is there an untapped gay market?",
        "\u2026Where did you get that information.",
        "Manuel who?",
        "Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.",
        "Son of a bitch.  Pardon me.",
        "Okay.",
        "Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.",
        "Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can\u2019t take the sales out of salesman.",
        "No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.",
        "I\u2019m turning myself in right now!",
        "Thank you.",
        "Great! That\u2019s great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.",
        "How is that possible?",
        "No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.",
        "Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers?  Michael Scott, head of sales.",
        "It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye.  I just got a new account for the gentleman\u2019s club in Carbondale. It is called \u201cCurves.\u201d I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!",
        "Why not? It\u2019s part of the sales experience.",
        "Well, okay\u2026",
        "What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?",
        "No, I\u2019m serious, we don\u2019t have to put up\u2026 Is it the dogs?",
        "You know what, we don\u2019t have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.",
        "No, this is geological.",
        "Are you kidding me?",
        "And you guys are okay with this?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Hey.",
        "You know, it\u2019s funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I\u2019m out there, and I wish I was in here.",
        "Yeah. Except there\u2019s no grass out there. It\u2019s just a farty dirt patch.",
        "I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.",
        "We make a poster that says \u201cHappy Opposite Day!\u201d and she sees it on the way out\u2026 Nah, that\u2019s stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.",
        "Lethal Weapon?",
        "What? What I\u2019m saying\u2026",
        "And weirdly I\u2019m a good dog person, right guys?  See? They love me.",
        "Alright!",
        "Oh, it smells good in here.",
        "Erin, what about my keyboard?  Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?",
        "Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She\u2019s contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car\u2026",
        "Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.",
        "Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.",
        "Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.",
        "Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don\u2019t want to know.  Tell me later.  Let\u2019s go!  Let\u2019s go!  Hospital!",
        "Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don\u2019t get revenge on me, nerd.",
        "No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can\u2019t tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.",
        "Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let\u2019s go!",
        "Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",
        "The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam\u2019s mind off of what\u2019s going on inside of her body.",
        "I will allow that.",
        "Okay.",
        "Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?",
        "Yes, Phyl?",
        "Nope, nope, I don\u2019t think anybody wants to see that.",
        "That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or\u2026?  Okay.",
        "Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.",
        "Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let\u2019s have happy times.",
        "Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I\u2019m thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.",
        "Okay, nobody touch Pam\u2019s nipples.  Think of Pam\u2019s nipples as Toby\u2019s grundle.",
        "Okay, yeah, why don\u2019t you go get it?",
        "Okay, the opposite of that?",
        "Ooh, someone\u2019s freakin\u2019.",
        "I think he is.",
        "Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it\u2019s time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?",
        "4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn\u2019t have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let\u2019s go to the hospital, shall we?",
        "We can do\u2026",
        "Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?",
        "What is October feast?",
        "Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and it\u2019s time to go to the hospital.",
        "That\u2019s right, let\u2019s do this.",
        "Let\u2019s go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.",
        "Are you kidding?",
        "You can do this.  You can do this.",
        "I\u2019m scared, too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We\u2019re going to have a baby.",
        "Let\u2019s do that.",
        "Two minutes apart.",
        "It\u2019s okay.",
        "I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.",
        "We\u2019re okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?",
        "You\u2019re not going to.  You know where you\u2019re going?",
        "Yes, you are.  And you know what you\u2019re going to have?",
        "Yes!  We\u2019re going to the hospital and we\u2019re going to have a baby.",
        "I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it\u2019s go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!",
        "No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.",
        "Yes.",
        "Go bag! Where\u2019s my go bag?  Where\u2019s my go bag?",
        "You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?",
        "No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.",
        "Thank you!  Wish me luck!",
        "Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!",
        "Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We\u2019re going now!",
        "No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.",
        "Dwight, what is the traffic like?",
        "Alright.",
        "Geesh, Dwight!",
        "What!?",
        "Where?",
        "By the bushes?",
        "Okay, go, go, go, go!",
        "Okay, just breathe\u2026  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.",
        "Yeah?",
        "I\u2019m texting about you, okay!?",
        "Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.    Ready?",
        "Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Do you have everything, guys?",
        "Okay, alright.",
        "Dunder-Mifflin.  It\u2019s okay.    I just did.",
        "Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.",
        "Okay, not yet, not yet.  I\u2019m going to go wash my eyes.",
        "That kid\u2019s going to have a lot of hair.",
        "I think it\u2019s going to be any minute now.",
        "Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?",
        "Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.",
        "Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna\u2026",
        "You\u2019re starting, you\u2019re kinda losing them.",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s right.  It\u2019s a baby, see?",
        "Okay.  You can\u2019t smoke anywhere these days.",
        "Guys, guys!",
        "Eleven pounds\u2026",
        "Thank you!  Thank you!",
        "Where\u2019s the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.",
        "Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.",
        "Love you, as a friend.",
        "Ooh, I want to hold the baby!",
        "Alright.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.",
        "There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.",
        "Who else here is single?",
        "I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.",
        "Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don\u2019t have any?    Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!",
        "Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you\u2019re obviously single.",
        "Andrew, what about you?",
        "Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.",
        "What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?",
        "I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.",
        "Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop \u2019em in your mouth.  Why don\u2019t you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?",
        "Good!",
        "Sure.  Kevin, please leave.",
        "Bye.",
        "Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.",
        "I\u2019m not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.",
        "No, Kevin doesn\u2019t have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won\u2019t kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him\u2026  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.",
        "Just don\u2019t let him sit on you\u2026  I\u2019m kidding.  You\u2019ll have fun.  It\u2019ll be good.  It\u2019ll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.",
        "Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.",
        "Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?",
        "Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I\u2019m surprised that you didn\u2019t question me in the first place.",
        "No.",
        "Lynn was as hot as Erin.",
        "This isn\u2019t about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you\u2026  Yes, Andy?",
        "Kev\u2026  Nice.  Going.",
        "There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today\u2026  I think I\u2019m going to be sick\u2026",
        "Hello hello. Top of the morning to you!  Ooh ooh! Green M&amp;Ms! Nature\u2019s Viagra!  Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It\u2019ll be a good day.",
        "It is St. Patrick\u2019s Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.",
        "Morning, honey-pile.",
        "It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.",
        "Yes it is!",
        "No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.",
        "Mm, that sounds great, actually.",
        "When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!",
        "That is a great idea JB.",
        "Oscar, homosexual accountant.",
        "Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We\u2019re very proud of you. You know what, we\u2019re gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.",
        "Oh no! Say it\u2019s not so, Jo, we\u2019re gonna miss you, we\u2019re gonna miss you so much!",
        "Well, I am heading down there.",
        "How about July 4th weekend?",
        "I did!",
        "You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and \u2013",
        "All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.",
        "Let\u2019s follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn\u2019t like Michael anymore. Hmmm.",
        "Hello. I want you to stop what you\u2019re doing right now. You are stressed, and I\u2019m taking you to lunch.",
        "No is not an option.",
        "All right. Well if you need me, I\u2019ll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.",
        "I\u2019ll be over there.",
        "Very nice.",
        "A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo\u2019s eye. How\u2019d you make that happen?",
        "Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?",
        "How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?",
        "Okay. All right.",
        "Hey there. So I think I\u2019m done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.",
        "Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.",
        "Right. What?",
        "Mm. mm. Oh well.",
        "No, no, no. That\u2019s super-clear-ish.  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.",
        "Hey Pack-man.",
        "How you doing stud? You already there?",
        "How\u2019s the lady situation?",
        "Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.",
        "Yeah. Maybe next year.",
        "How late do we have to work tonight?",
        "Why does she do that? Why doesn\u2019t she just tell you what your schedule is?",
        "Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would\u2019ve turned thirty. That\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s just depressing.",
        "Hello Jo.",
        "There is, as a matter of fact. It\u2019s getting sorta late. It\u2019s 8:30. And it\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I\u2019m going to dismiss my employees.",
        "I\u2019m thrilled with the work they\u2019ve done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.",
        "Okay. Happy St. Patrick\u2019s Day.  And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.",
        "Yes.",
        "Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!",
        "Drinks are on me!",
        "Oh -hoh! All right.",
        "Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don\u2019t know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?  Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her?  As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, be happy.\u201d",
        "Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever.  What the hell is going on back there?",
        "Hey Jim, Jim. Come here.  Do you know who that is?",
        "Look at him. Look at him \u2013 t-shirt, jeans\u2026",
        "I am flattered. That\u2019s Johnny Depp.",
        "In my condo complex.",
        "I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.",
        "Hey, Jim, Jim \u2013 where, where do I find the Black Pearl?",
        "Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.",
        "No. I\u2019m Captain Jack Sparrow.",
        "Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it\u2019s not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you\u2019d seen Roger Clemens?",
        "Yeah. Well, it wasn\u2019t him.",
        "I know, I know.",
        "I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.",
        "First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don\u2019t have a pet, please don\u2019t feel like \u2013",
        "Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company\u2026 are not here yet. But will be..  No, no, meeting\u2019s not over.",
        "No sales topic per se.",
        "Dwight?",
        "I would like your undivided attention, please.",
        "Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it\u2019s kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.",
        "Yeah.",
        "M-hmm.",
        "Is that all you have to say to me?",
        "Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It\u2019s a big cheque.",
        "Stop sexting Pam. I\u2019m trying to congratulate you.",
        "You writing your memoirs over there?",
        "Well, it\u2019s a pretty big check.",
        "Okay. Don\u2019t gloat. Here\u2019s the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.",
        "I\u2019m just saying, that \u2013",
        "Honey and jelly sandwich time.",
        "Oh, you got to be kidding me.  Look at that. That\u2019s \u2013",
        "You saw who did this and you didn\u2019t stop them?",
        "The sales department smashed my sandwich.",
        "You don\u2019t get it.",
        "That\u2019s what she said.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Ah, just the stupid leads.",
        "Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I\u2019m thinking? I\u2019m thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don\u2019t. Not even Sabre owns this place. It\u2019s a rental. I\u2019m kind of sick of the attitude around here. I\u2019m sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim\u2026 I think I am not going to give these to you.",
        "Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just \u2013 imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.",
        "They act like I have no power.",
        "Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.",
        "Exactly that.",
        "Exactly that.",
        "Hello. May I have everyone\u2019s attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I\u2019m going to give the leads to\u2026 King Creed!",
        "\u2013 and to King Meredith!",
        "And to King Angela!  Because today we are all kings. And queens .",
        "I\u2019m giving them the leads, Phyllis.",
        "Hey.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Okay.",
        "Alright.",
        "Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don\u2019t respect the father who doesn\u2019t respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?",
        "I do understand it.",
        "Or is it?",
        "Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment.  A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally  Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing  Some people shouldn\u2019t be in this business.",
        "Well, bigshot, \u2018If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes\u2019.",
        "Wait. What day is today?",
        "Oh my god. Oh my god  oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey  wait, wait!",
        "Okay. You know what, let\u2019s just go to the dump, start looking \u2013 Ryan, c\u2019mon, shotgun in my car \u2013",
        "Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, \u2018Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they\u2019re now in the city dump.\u201d",
        "Well, that\u2019s not the way it\u2019s going t sound. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019ll go to the dump, we\u2019ll look around, then we\u2019ll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you \u2013",
        "Really?",
        "Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit  Complicit. You were all successories!",
        "You can.",
        "Okay fine, I get it. I\u2019ll just go by myself.",
        "You know, Dwight, there was a time when you\u2019d be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.",
        "Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don\u2019t believe me, look in my gutters.",
        "You\u2019ve changed, man.",
        "Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.",
        "No, I\u2019m talking about your personality, Dwight.",
        "Assistant to the managed him \u2013",
        "Yeah.",
        "You think you would have done better without me? Really?",
        "Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t have been hanging out watching karate movies with you \u2013",
        "You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies \u2013",
        "That\u2019s my wife you\u2019re talking about, man.",
        "If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.",
        "No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight.  No, time out, time out.  Time in!",
        "Don\u2019t even think about that",
        "Okay, Dwight. Here we go  oh god.",
        "We\u2019re never going to find those leads, are we?",
        "This  Why would somebody throw that out?",
        "Yeah, she does \u2013 she loves purple.  Does it stink?",
        "Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That\u2019s it. And the caption would read:",
        "In the dump.",
        "No! Better!",
        "I\u2019m going to give Erin $15.",
        "A one-on-one lunch with Erin?",
        "She\u2019s kind of a rube.",
        "Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I\u2019ll take her to lunch.",
        "Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary\u2019s Day.",
        "I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to\u2026 lunch.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Well, Hayworth\u2019s is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I\u2019m\u2026",
        "Okay, well, we\u2019ll figure something.",
        "Okay, let\u2019s go to Hayworth\u2019s.",
        "All right.",
        "Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I\u2019m kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "Ahhh.",
        "Right.",
        "An age or month?",
        "I\u2019ve been trying. I\u2019ve been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.",
        "So how are things going with Andy?",
        "Well, let\u2019s see. Um\u2026 Andy. Plays the banjo.",
        "Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don\u2019t think he is a snappy dresser.",
        "I don\u2019t think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.",
        "Mm-hmm. You didn\u2019t know that? Oh.",
        "Okay.",
        "I don\u2019t know. Probably didn\u2019t want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.",
        "They were engaged, so\u2026  Okay, you know what, sir?",
        "Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Mm-hmm. Yeah.",
        "Well\u2026",
        "What are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody\u2019s looking at you right now.",
        "I\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having!",
        "Did you have a\u2026 did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.",
        "You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela\u2019s not so great, so..",
        "No. No. No.",
        "Stop talking.",
        "Oh God.",
        "Andy, she\u2019s not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn\u2019t tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That\u2019s like.. that\u2019s like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.",
        "You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can\u2019t and won\u2019t keep a secret.",
        "Erin?",
        "No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?",
        "Oh. Yep. I\u2019m sorry about that. I feel\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I caused that thing.",
        "Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn\u2019t worry about Angela. She doesn\u2019t hold a candle to you, Erin. She\u2019s old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she\u2019s, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.",
        "You said butt.",
        "Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: \u201cHey! Hey Scott!\u201d",
        "Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? \u201cOscar. I am the Count.\u201d Nailed him. Nailed him.  Good work Cookie Monster.",
        "Buenos dias, Erin.",
        "No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.",
        "I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for\u2026 for all of North America. And\u2026 I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.",
        "Buenos dias, Jaime.",
        "Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!",
        "La telefona.",
        "Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!",
        "Damn it.  Ah, Angelo.",
        "Yo soy Cancun.",
        "Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.",
        "I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.",
        "Did somebody order a hooker over here?",
        "Hi. How are you?",
        "There\u2019s this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid &amp; Dexter\u2019s and, right now, we\u2019re in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so\u2026",
        "Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.",
        "Hi.",
        "Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria\u2019s Secret?",
        "Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.",
        "Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.",
        "Okay, I have more of them.",
        "I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you\u2026 there we go!  Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.",
        "And that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black.",
        "It\u2019s subtle. That\u2019s how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn\u2019t know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she\u2019s turned on.",
        "This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I\u2019ve never taken anybody there before.",
        "Ryan.",
        "And that\u2019s it. That\u2019s me. That\u2019s who I am.",
        "Oh, thanks.  You\u2019re not bad, either.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?",
        "You didn\u2019t see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?",
        "Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.",
        "Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.",
        "So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?",
        "Maybe wee find some wiggle room?",
        "I think we could.",
        "Okay, well sometimes\u2026 sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.",
        "Why don\u2019t you run them again?",
        "If she is, it\u2019s working.",
        "So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller\u2026",
        "Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish.  Just kidding. Do you like mints?",
        "I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?",
        "They\u2019re good",
        "Sure.",
        "I can\u2019t stop myself from kissing her.",
        "Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it\u2019s not totally insane to try one more time.",
        "Okay. What do you think?",
        "Andy?",
        "Okay, some for, some against.",
        "Pam?",
        "I\u2019m going with Pam\u2019s group.",
        "Here we go.",
        "Okay.",
        "No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just\u2026 thank you for talking. Wish me luck.",
        "What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that\u2019s not\u2026 the point.",
        "We should have your contract done by Thursday.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I think so.",
        "Okay. So\u2026 Oh, Donna?",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "Mmm.",
        "Ahem. So, um\u2026 okay, if you have\u2026 if there\u2019s any other questions that you have\u2026",
        "All right. All right. Bye.",
        "And have a good elevator ride.",
        "Oh, what\u2019s that out there?",
        "I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Can\u2019t really trust my feelings anymore.",
        "She suckered you too.",
        "Was it the cleavage?",
        "Yep.",
        "God. She left this here?",
        "Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.",
        "Yeah. This could be a signal. People don\u2019t just take barrettes off.",
        "Well\u2026",
        "Yeah, I know. I know.",
        "I know. You\u2019re right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.",
        "",
        "Oh. You\u2019re still here. I have your baguette.",
        "You know what? Everybody told me that you weren\u2019t interested. Everybody. And I didn\u2019t believe \u2019em. And they were right. So\u2026 there\u2019s your barrette.",
        "Who?",
        "About what?",
        "No, no. No.",
        "No\u2026",
        "What happened?",
        "Really?! Oh, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s such good news. I did it!  I kissed. We kissed.",
        "No, I\u2019m serious. It\u2026 this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was\u2026 I returned her barrette  We ki\u2026 We did. Okay. We did. We did.",
        "You know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts.  I did do it!",
        "Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?",
        "Get back to work, Dwight. Please.",
        "Ooh! Things with Donna are so\u2026 oh-ho-ho! They\u2019re going great. I, uh\u2026 we\u2019re just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and\u2026 orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I\u2019m actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!",
        "Who enjoys the weekends?  Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did.  And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, you get out of here, big dog.  Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.",
        "Yeah, well, Stanley doesn\u2019t help with anything. Come on. Shout \u2019em out, shout \u2019em out.",
        "Oh!",
        "That\u2019s fun.",
        "All right.",
        "We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang\u2019s.",
        "Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, \u201cI wanna go to Mount Pocono,\u201d you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.",
        "You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn\u2019t see.",
        "You guys think Donna\u2019s cheating on me?",
        "\u2026 and\u2026 we had sex, too.",
        "How?",
        "How do I not make any more of it?",
        "All right.   And she won\u2019t say, \u201cI love you.\u201d",
        "Nine dates. I said it on the second date.",
        "Yeah, she does all that.",
        "No, no\u2026",
        "Run what?",
        "Why didn\u2019t you just say that, Pam?",
        "Well, that\u2019s easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It\u2019s stupid. I live in a fantasy world.",
        "Yes, Jim, I do. And I can\u2019t stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.",
        "That\u2019s what makes it so wrong.",
        "Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that\u2019s what\u2019s killing me.",
        "I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.",
        "This is you. How much do you charge?",
        "I\u2019ll give you $50. Money\u2019s no object.",
        "Okay.",
        "It\u2019s never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn\u2019t have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.",
        "It\u2019s comfort food, all right?  God.",
        "I know. Well, I hope you\u2019re right. We\u2019ll see what Dwight says.",
        "Because I have him investigating her. I\u2019m waiting for a text update.",
        "It\u2019s too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.",
        "God, this is so disgusting.",
        "I know.",
        "That\u2019s not true.  You\u2019re right, I ruin everything. And I\u2019ve known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.",
        "Helene?",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.",
        "All right.",
        "You\u2019re back. What happened?",
        "No, what happened with Donna?",
        "Ugh!",
        "No. No! Are you sure?",
        "Who eats eight protein bars?",
        "Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.",
        "What? No, she didn\u2019t say that.",
        "I am not paying for that membership.",
        "Ohhh\u2026 mmm\u2026",
        "No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?",
        "That\u2019s her?",
        "Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right.  Okay, I\u2019ll talk to you later.",
        "I didn\u2019t. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.",
        "Ye\u2026 pfff. Well, no. It\u2019s a lie. That\u2019s not what happened. I just like you. I can\u2019t believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.",
        "If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.",
        "Well, you are boner-ific.",
        "\u2026poop my pants.",
        "Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?",
        "We are?",
        "Wow.  That\u2019s exciting.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well it can wait. It can wait.",
        "Jim is her husband.",
        "And they are having problems, so sh\u2026",
        "Good in bed.",
        "Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?",
        "Okay, weirdo.",
        "Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?",
        "Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?",
        "God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?",
        "I\u2019m gonna kill him. No, I\u2019m not. I feel\u2026 I\u2026 no, I\u2019m not going to kill him.",
        "I have to hear it from her.",
        "I need to have her tell me herself. Right?",
        "I need to have her say\u2026",
        "I need to say, \u201cWhat the hell is that? What the hell is that?\u201d",
        "No, God! No, no, oh, my God!",
        "Okay. Okay. Okay.",
        "You know what? We should really do something fun this week.",
        "Wouldn\u2019t that be fun?",
        "How about Thursday?",
        "I can\u2019t do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?",
        "Oh, really? \u2019cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It\u2019d be a great, great concert.",
        "Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.",
        "Nope, that\u2019s Tuesday.",
        "You\u2019re cheating. You\u2019re cheating on me.",
        "Pam told me.",
        "Who is he?",
        "The other man. Who\u2019s the guy? Who is it?",
        "I\u2019m the mistress?",
        "Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap.  But I figured I\u2019d rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.  The second time\u2026 I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.  Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time\u2026 I did it out of spite.",
        "Pfffffttt.",
        "You\u2019re kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?",
        "You know what? We\u2019re not gonna die of radon, we\u2019re gonna die of boredom.",
        "Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.",
        "Okay, alright.",
        "I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.",
        "Okay geniuses, how would you do it?",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.",
        "Toby, just do it! God!",
        "Good work.",
        "Morning everyone.",
        "Hello!",
        "Oh, thank you. It\u2019s reversible, I think.",
        "Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles\u2019 flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That\u2019s my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?",
        "Okay. Well\u2026 that\u2019s random. I will dig into those later.",
        "No, I gotta go. Text me later.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.",
        "That\u2026 exists?",
        "Okay, well, I\u2019ll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.",
        "Okay, Pam\u2026 she\u2019s not invisible so stop asking silly questions.",
        "Since when is this an office where we delve into each other\u2019s personal lives?",
        "I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband\u2026 or you took a random poll, yeah, it\u2019s wrong.",
        "Well, I think we all know what you\u2019re capable of Meredith.",
        "People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.",
        "I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.",
        "He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out.  It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, it\u2026 why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat\u2026",
        "On her diet! He\u2019s a sports guy. He\u2019s scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.",
        "Real sports with Bryant Gumble.",
        "You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.",
        "Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.",
        "Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he\u2019s an angel? I don\u2019t think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.",
        "I am Beyonce always.",
        "Yes, I am.",
        "I would love that.",
        "I have work to do.",
        "Let\u2019s go.  I can\u2019t wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he\u2019s making me do to her.",
        "All right, Andy, please.",
        "Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That\u2019s him. That\u2019s him.",
        "Right there. The coach!",
        "Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?",
        "All right. Can you just\u2013 can you just act normal for a second, please?",
        "You have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.",
        "You don\u2019t. No, no.",
        "You don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t\u2013 you don\u2019t know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn\u2019t even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it\u2019s like, \u201cHey, Donna, why don\u2019t you wash the dishes?\u201d \u201cHigh-five, Donna.\u201d \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you bring me my slippers?\u201d \u201cHi-five. I\u2019m taking all the credit.\u201d",
        "Okay, well, that\u2019s because he\u2019s paying their salary.",
        "I know, I know, I know. It\u2013I\u2019m\u2013it\u2013 that was a euphemism.",
        "Shh! Okay, all right. Don\u2019t, don\u2019t.",
        "Okay.",
        "No. God. You go talk to him.",
        "No, no, no.",
        "I\u2019m good. Oh, my God.",
        "Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.",
        "Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart\u2019s still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, \u201cI\u2019m sleeping with your wife.\u201d And you know who does that? James freakin\u2019 Bond.",
        "Okay, orange slices. There ya go.",
        "Don\u2019t thank me. Thank Dylan\u2019s mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!",
        "You love it. There ya go.",
        "Uh, no, they didn\u2019t say team. They just said coal Hawks.",
        "Well, then it wouldn\u2019t be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.",
        "I did.",
        "No. We just talked. He\u2019s very nice.",
        "It did not.",
        "Isn\u2019t it?",
        "I\u2019m awful, aren\u2019t I?",
        "I\u2019m an awful guy! Ooh!",
        "I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I\u2019m hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.",
        "I don\u2019t care. I have an appetite for life!  Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That\u2019s Lemon.",
        "You\u2019ll learn, baby. You\u2019ll learn.",
        "Yeah, I noticed that.",
        "Nope.",
        "I have got big balls.",
        "Okay.  Phyllis. Okay. Look at me.  Phyllis, look at\u2013  okay, that\u2019s\u2026  All right, all right. You know what? I\u2019m sick of this. I\u2019m sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that\u2019s going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.",
        "Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we\u2019re into isn\u2019t very condo-appropriate.",
        "Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.",
        "Nobody better try to stop me. Good.",
        "How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud.  Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I\u2019m a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision.  At the end of the day, we have to do what\u2019s right. And it was either living with myself or\u2026 being happy. And I picked\u2026 the\u2026 former.",
        "Yes?",
        "Umm\u2026 I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to\u2026 the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.",
        "Oh. Okay. I was talking about\u2026 what do\u2013 what? What\u2019s going on?",
        "There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed.  Michael Scott, as seen on TV.",
        "OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!",
        "Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I\u2019m like, what? All right. So I do it. It\u2019s on TV last night. And it\u2019s in the paper today. And it\u2019s online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It\u2019s like, come on, people, enough.",
        "Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.",
        "Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes. Come on! Get it up! That\u2019s what\u2026 let\u2019s do it!",
        "Please.",
        "Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It\u2019s not even that interesting a baby otter, it can\u2019t even stand up.  It\u2019s trying to stand up\u2026  there it goes.",
        "Jo! We were not expecting you!",
        "Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.",
        "Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.",
        "There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like\u2026",
        "Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.",
        "Okay.",
        "We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.",
        "Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.",
        "I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I\u2019d prefer it if they died, \u2019cause it\u2019s not right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ridiculous, Angela. And like I\u2019m going to believe one of his spermed lovers.",
        "Is there something that you would like to say to me?",
        "About talking to the press?",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "I don\u2019t believe you.",
        "That\u2019s a little much. All right, all right, all right.",
        "Okay, I believe you, I believe you.",
        "Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?",
        "Oh, no, no, no\u2026",
        "Oh my god. Was she cute?",
        "Oh, god, Darryl!",
        "I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he\u2019s probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don\u2019t know what is.",
        "You leaked it?",
        "I don\u2019t know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god\u2026 my mind is going a mile an hour.",
        "Oh.",
        "Two whistleblowers\u2026 two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.",
        "So see you in Meredith\u2019s van in five minutes.",
        "No, you know what\u2019s messed up? This situation all up in here is what\u2019s messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.",
        "What do we got?",
        "It\u2019s okay, she\u2019s cool, she also whistle-blew.",
        "Hey, hey, it\u2019s as interesting as a morgue.",
        "Okay, here\u2019s what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.",
        "No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.",
        "Just don\u2019t say no.",
        "That\u2019s just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let\u2019s just\u2026",
        "Okay. You can count on me.",
        "Hey Jo.",
        "I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make \u2019em come to work, and we work \u2019em, and we make \u2019em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay \u2019em but we make \u2019em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it\u2019s Christmas, but right after they\u2019re back in the thick of it.",
        "What?",
        "It doesn\u2019t matter what I know.",
        "Why?",
        "Well, deal with this.",
        "What?",
        "Are you going to kill me?",
        "Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but\u2026 I have an early dinner that I need to get to\u2026 with the Chief of Police.",
        "I have rights.",
        "I am not going to tell you anything.",
        "Well, I\u2019m going through a little bit of a rough patch.",
        "Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.",
        "And my new favorite restaurant sucks\u2026 I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? \u2026 I miss Holly.",
        "Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It\u2019s not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.",
        "Hmm, hmm.",
        "You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.",
        "I, I surely do, and don\u2019t call me honey.  You were playing too.",
        "We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?",
        "That was fun.",
        "Thanks. Today helped.",
        "Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.",
        "",
        "I suppose summer had to end sometime. It\u2019s sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw \u2018Inception.\u2019 Or at least I dreamt I did.",
        "He\u2019s not the worst, okay? He\u2019s not the worst. You know who\u2019s the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though.  Ah! It\u2019s not cappuccino.",

        "Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.",
        "Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn\u2019t even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.",
        "God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.",
        "Thank you.",
        "No! No. I\u2019m just saying, why does God get to do something that I don\u2019t?",
        "Well, then, why aren\u2019t you bugging me to fire everybody who\u2019s bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That\u2019s reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!",
        "Because I wanted you to come to me and say, \u201cWow, he is so great.\u201d And I was gonna say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s in the genes.\u201d And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I\u2019d point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don\u2019t want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.",
        "Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!",
        "Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!",
        "All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.",
        "Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.",
        "I\u2019m reconsidering sending them back anyway.",
        "Wait a minute.",
        "Don\u2019t-all right. Well, ok, you\u2019ve just committed a felony.",
        "No, I know they fit. It\u2019s not about the fit.",
        "Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.",
        "You don\u2019t have all the facts.",
        "I love him.",
        "No. No. He\u2019s my nephew.",
        "Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.",
        "I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.",
        "Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he\u2019ll slow down, and I\u2019ll push him again. That\u2019s the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It\u2019s all about give and take, but mostly it\u2019s about pushing each other.",
        "Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no!  Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar\u2019s head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!",
        "Give me the pointer.",
        "No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela\u2019s boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we\u2019re starting with account setup-",
        "Okay, can I have that?",
        "Ok, I am going to count down from five.",
        "I\u2019m not kidding.",
        "Give-okay. Alright, give it up.",
        "You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!",
        "That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do, Luke!",
        "I had to do that.",
        "All right. Are we good?  You\u2019re okay. He\u2019s okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.",
        "Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?",
        "Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn\u2019t. These things seldom work out. I don\u2019t know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they\u2019d be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat\u2019s off to them.",
        "That\u2019s it? Really? That\u2019s nothing. All right. That\u2019s highway robbery.",
        "I can do that.",
        "Okay. Wait, what?",
        "Is there another option?",
        "This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!",
        "Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s done. But my punishment is \u2026 um \u2026 worse than hell.",
        "I know what you want to ask me. \u201cDid your mom ever see you naked?\u201d",
        "So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019re going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That\u2019s the key.",
        "One hour.",
        "One hour. We\u2019ve done one hour. Let\u2019s just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.",
        "No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.",
        "You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?",
        "Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.",
        "Toby, can I really tell you anything?",
        "Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis\u2026 I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah\u2026 weird. I think that was \u2026 I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he\u2019s a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.",
        "And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight?",
        "Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that?  Three hours. We\u2019re half way done.",
        "This is plenty complicated.",
        "I\u2019ve played it once or twice with Jeff.",
        "Jeff was my mother\u2019s boyfriend, who she married.",
        "Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.",
        "Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn\u2019t able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.",
        "I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.",
        "I guess that\u2019s why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.",
        "Right. Why would a dog do that? That\u2019s silly.",
        "When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I\u2019ve never said it out loud, so\u2026",
        "Well, lets not get too\u2026 This isn\u2019t a counseling session\u2026 Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.",
        "You. Bitch. God! You\u2019re very helpful aren\u2019t you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?",
        "You are good. But you know what? You can\u2019t help people. You couldn\u2019t help your marriage. You lose. I don\u2019t need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can\u2019t help anybody. I don\u2019t need your help! Am I going to make you cry?",
        "Ok.",
        "You\u2019ll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these  and call me in the morning.",
        "You forged them! You forged the forms!",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.",
        "You don\u2019t make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake\u2026 Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet\u2026  \u201cI mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I\u2019m here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!\u201d  Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let\u2019s do it to it!",
        "That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?",
        "Really? They didn\u2019t call me. Who am I playing? \u2026Andy?",
        "Andy, what time\u2019s the show?",
        "How long is it?",
        "Nope, can\u2019t make it.",
        "They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy\u2019s play, they took mine.",
        "I can\u2019t Andy, it\u2019s too hard. That\u2019s-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?",
        "Wow.",
        "I wish I could, Andy, but I can\u2019t. I have plans that night. I\u2019m going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You\u2019re that friend. I\u2019m going to see your play.",
        "And scene.",
        "Oh, hey guys.",
        "I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.",
        "Yes.",
        "Nope.",
        "This is ridiculous. You\u2019d think they\u2019d discourage people from bringing in balloons.",
        "No, Darryl. This guy\u2019s a world-class actor. He doesn\u2019t daylight as your plumber.",
        "Are you kidding me?",
        "All right, I\u2019m sorry. God.",
        "Hello.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yes.",
        "Good.",
        "You enjoy the second act.",
        "Thank you. You, too.",
        "How is that funny?",
        "Boo! Boo!",
        "Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it\u2019s dried. I\u2019ve already eaten, like, 30 apricots.",
        "Yeah, good job. Well done.",
        "Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn\u2019t one of em.",
        "Get your eyes checked, chucklehead.",
        "Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn\u2019t think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.",
        "That would never happen.",
        "Okay. I appreciate the feedback.",
        "I don\u2019t like that at all.",
        "Hey, what\u2019s going on here? Post-show blues?",
        "Yeah, I get those every day after work.",
        "Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.",
        "I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.",
        "I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.",
        "Come on, Andy, seriously.",
        "In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun!  I\u2019m just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone\u2019s tightening their belts in this economy.  Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn\u2019t a victim, if you know what I\u2019m talkin about.",
        "No, that was- I\u2019m just getting into the first act.",
        "There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work.  He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves\u2026 other things as well.",

        "You mean cancer?",
        "It is?",
        "Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don\u2019t have acne. I have a cold sore. I don\u2019t even have a cold. I don\u2019t know how I got it.",
        "How?",
        "What?",
        "Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.",
        "No! It was like four years ago!",
        "Why at least? If you\u2019re guessing forty six just say forty six.",
        "How did this happen, how did I get this?",
        "You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch.  It\u2019s me own damn fault. Woman in every port.",
        "Don\u2019t even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.",
        "Oh my God! What if I did?",
        "Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.",

        "No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?",
        "Does your stupid husband have it?",
        "Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!",
        "No this is Holly.",
        "No this is Holly.",
        "Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.",

        "Any nuns?",
        "Were they in the missionary position?",

Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You\u2019re wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don\u2019t feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn\u2019t joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don\u2019t know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok.  Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.",

        "Stay-",
        "Oh!",
        "Don\u2019t let us down.",
        "No, no, no\u2026.",
        "I\u2019m goin \u2018in!",
        "Stop, stop! Oh, my god!  Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.",
        "I said stop. Okay, Danny\u2026this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-",
        "Don\u2019t! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.",
        "I owe you\u2026a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.",
        "A surveillance room next to this one.",
        "Yes. And it\u2019s the sincerest form of flattery.",
        "Well-",
        "Okay. You know what, it wasn\u2019t just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.",
        "No, we don\u2019t. Here\u2019s-here\u2019s my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.",
        "You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop.  You are a good salesman. And because of that\u2026I want you to work for me.",
        "So, you will?",
        "Hold it, hold it.  Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better\u2026or to be worse or to stay the same?",
        "Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?",
        "I know, I know.",
        "Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?",
        "I can give you more money-there\u2019s your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there\u2019s your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?",
        "Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!",
        "O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site\u2026or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?",
        "No. No. No. Somebody in this office.",
        "No, me. Right? Sorta like\u2026a little younger version of me.",
        "Yes.",
        "No, you may not.",
        "I said no.",
        "We\u2019re not-",
        "Okay. Let\u2019s-all right, all right. Let\u2019s talk. Please don\u2019t let him leave.  Don\u2019t leave. Don\u2019t let him.",
        "Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?",
        "Okay. Well\u2026get ready, \u2019cause it\u2019s gonna get better.",
        "No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can\u2019t now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he\u2019s going to steal sales for us.",
        "He doesn\u2019t need to sit, he\u2019s a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.",
        "Good-bye!",
        "This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don\u2019t even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.",
        "All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!",
        "A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year!  Six seconds, MacGruber!  Pam\u2019s got a lot of fun stuff planned!  Uh, two seconds MacGruber!  Including a\u2026 costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board\u2026 OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION!  MACGRUBERRRR!",
        "MACGRUBER!",
        "Oh, here we go!",
        "OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?",
        "So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?",
        "Blackula!",
        "Oh, so\u2026 I almost forgot. You\u2019ll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That\u2019s like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.",
        "Yeah. I\u2019m sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.",
        "Really? We\u2019re good?",
        "Okay.  Okay.",
        "Oh. It\u2019s a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.",
        "Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I\u2019d like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they\u2019re missing.",
        "Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?",
        "Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.",
        "You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!",
        "Yeah, I bet it is! If you\u2019re gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.",
        "This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin\u2019s. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.",
        "I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don\u2019t care if I take a bullet. We\u2019re gonna call them, we\u2019re gonna put them on speakerphone right now\u2026",
        "And we are going to straighten this out.",
        "Mmhm!",
        "I\u2019m a little peeved at Darryl right now.",
        "No, he didn\u2019t go behind my back. He went over my head.",
        "What is taking someone from behind?",
        "It was a good idea, though.",
        "What the hell are they talking about?",
        "Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don\u2019t- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That\u2019s inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?",
        "Oh, you\u2019re sorry?",
        "What did you just thought?",
        "All right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, don\u2019t let it happen again.",
        "I-",
        "Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That\u2019s not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.",
        "You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.",
        "Okay, that might help. If you said \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d in front of everybody.",
        "In front of me.",
        "So that\u2019s it.",
        "Is it?",
        "Yeah, I gotta get in on this.  Hey, it\u2019s cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I\u2019m cool! I\u2019m hip and I\u2019m jive! And I don\u2019t care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!",
        "Still don\u2019t know who I am? I\u2019ll give you a hint. I go over other people\u2019s heads.",
        "What\u2019s a bad idea?",
        "NEVER!  Okay, you know what? Fine.  I\u2019m not Darryl. And thank God I\u2019m not Darryl.",
        "Hey, can I play? Why don\u2019t you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?",
        "Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.",
        "Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?",
        "If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?",
        "Thank you.",
        "If they\u2019re good ideas, I\u2019m not gonna say no!",
        "That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?",
        "Oh\u2026",
        "Well\u2026",
        "Stop it! Stop, stop. We\u2019re thinking. We\u2019re thinking about it.",
        "You don\u2019t have to point to the fact that we\u2019re thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.",
        "I am not budging on the hat issue.",
        "Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.",
        "Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we\u2019ll give her a call.",
        "Sorry I was a jerk.",
        "Friends fight. Friends fight.",
        "That\u2019s true, that\u2019s true. I dated her momma, and you know what-",
        "Um\u2026 kay. Uh, alright.",
        "Top of the Sunday morning to you.",
        "Oh, yes.  Doobie-doobie doo.",
        "I invited everyone in the office because it\u2019s not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate\u2026 my joy. And our, all of ours joys.",
        "Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can\u2019t refuse. Scooch over.",
        "But I\u2019m the Godfather.",
        "Are you talking to me?",
        "Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I\u2019m not the godfather.",
        "So who is the godfather?",
        "Okay. Old friend, like, you\u2019ve known him since kindergarten?",
        "No, I have plenty of friends, so\u2026 all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.",
        "I don\u2019t even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that\u2019s not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It\u2019s as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That\u2019s great, because, you know, the paper industry\u2019s not gonna last forever.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Good morning.",
        "How are you? Good morning. Good morning.",
        "I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.",
        "Oh, after you.",
        "No, I insist. After me.",
        "Thank you. You too.",
        "You know what, guys, let\u2019s just enjoy lunch.",
        "Shh.",
        "No.",
        "Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.",
        "Are you kidding me? Stop it.",
        "Shh.",
        "Look at that. Look at that. That\u2019s fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let\u2019s go help Africa. Let\u2019s go build an airport. We\u2019ll start small. We\u2019ll have a car wash. We\u2019ll send some cheerleaders to regionals.",
        "Yeah, well, that\u2019s just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don\u2019t have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.",
        "Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.",
        "Well, it\u2019s, it\u2019s-",
        "No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What\u2019s so great about your lives that you think you\u2019re better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You\u2019re mean. You\u2019re mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don\u2019t stop worrying so much about what you\u2019re gonna put in your gullet, you\u2019re gonna die in about a month.",
        "Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We\u2019re proud of you.  Bye. Okay.",
        "Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?",
        "I\u2019ll take a shirt.",
        "If you\u2019ll have me, yes.",
        "Really?  Thank you. All right.",
        "No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m staying on the bus. I\u2019m already on the bus. I\u2019m going.",
        "It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.",
        "You know what, my job will be here when I get back.",
        "Hey, right?",
        "Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.",
        "Tell them that I\u2019m in a meeting.",
        "No, you may not.",
        "Thank you.",
        "See you in a few months.",
        "Mm. That\u2019s not gonna happen.",
        "Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So\u2026",
        "How long till we get to Mexico?",
        "Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?",
        "Why aren\u2019t they building it themselves?",
        "Do we know how? I don\u2019t know how. You know how?",
        "Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?",
        "What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?",
        "Oh, God, you know what? I\u2019m gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.",
        "And Cinco de Mayo.",
        "No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven\u2019t even started. Now we\u2019re those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.",
        "Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?",
        "Do that. Do it.",
        "Okay, driver, driver, if you\u2019re not gonna stop this bus, then I\u2019m going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on.",
        "Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.",
        "Stop the bus, okay?",
        "I didn\u2019t sign up for this. You guys are young, that\u2019s great. You want to give back to society. I\u2019ve done that. I need to take.",
        "Blah-di-blah!",
        "We could go back and forth all day. It\u2019s not gonna solve anything.",
        "Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don\u2019t. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?",
        "Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We\u2019ll keep an eye on America for you.",
        "Why quick?",
        "Is anyone still at the church?",
        "What? Shut up.",
        "It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.",
        "They have him surrounded. It\u2019s the SWAT. The SWAT\u2019s arriving.",
        "Ok, that\u2019s our street! That\u2019s our street! He\u2019s going down our street!  Come on everybody!",
        "There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it!",
        "Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught?  Well kiddo, I was there. I was there\u2026 And I\u2019ll tell you what.  You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.",

        "I\u2019m joking. I\u2019m kidding around! I\u2019m not actually angry.  I\u2019m not busy at all, I\u2019m not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I\u2019m a total Gleek.",
        "You know who my favorite character is? The invalid.  I am coming to your party.",
        "Kevin!",
        "Yes, I am. Are you?",

        "Big\u2026",
        "All right!",
        "Okay okay okay.",
        "Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag.

        "We already have a buyer.",
        "At least.",
        "That\u2019s right!",
        "Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?",
        "No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.",
        "Look at that. Triple your investment by January.",
        "There you go.",
        "Do not talk like that, Stanley.",
        "Here we go.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s Ryan the WUPHF guy!\u201d",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s up there.\u201d",
        "Look at that! He threw \u2019em on the ground!",
        "No, it\u2019s not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.",
        "I won\u2019t sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn\u2019t that right?",
        "I\u2013yes. We\u2019re not selling. I will not sell.",
        "Can\u2019t talk, saving the planet.",
        "We Don\u2019t? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?",
        "Eight Years.",
        "No, I won\u2019t even consider it.",
        "Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.",
        "I think you are wrong.",
        "You may be right. I may be crazy.",
        "I\u2019m just saying that I think I agree with your point.",
        "I thought it might make me feel better.",
        "But it just may be a lunatic\u2026  No.",
        "Good, good, bro.",
        "Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?",
        "Nine days, though. That\u2019s, like\u2026",
        "Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.",
        "Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.",
        "So you would think that\u2019s a good idea for me to do?",
        "Mm-Hmm.",
        "Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so\u2026",
        "Tonight?",
        "Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.",
        "Hello.",
        "I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.",
        "I\u2019m not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend.  And he\u2019s also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn\u2019t, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.",
        "Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody\u2019s money.",
        "You can\u2019t have it.",
        "The world sends people your way\u2026 Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you\u2019re dealt.  Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That\u2019s easy. Gimme a hard one. That\u2019s what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam\u2019s a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So\u2026  That\u2019s Uh\u2026",
        "Thank God.",
        "Mmhmm, China. China.",
        "It was great. China.",
        "Everything here was made in China, Pam.",
        "They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we\u2019re falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.",
        "Yeah, right here. It is right there.  Anybody read the news any more?",
        "I found that in the waiting room at the dentist\u2019s office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that\u2019s the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.",
        "My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight.",
        "What?",
        "So much for keeping our secrets up high.",
        "I know what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re going to put our best minds on it.",
        "Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.",
        "Welcome to your future.",
        "How do we stop it? With a big idea. That\u2019s what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?",
        "Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.",
        "Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are\u2026 yes.",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "Alright.",
        "I don\u2019t know what the  that was.",
        "No he\u2019s not right. We\u2019re not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.",
        "No, no. That is right now.",
        "In terms of land, not population.",
        "No, no you\u2019re wrong about this.",
        "I got it from NewYorkTimes.com",
        "So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what?  I don\u2019t care.",
        "Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?",
        "Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.",
        "Very comedically humorous Jim.",
        "Try \u2018Control P\u2019.",
        "Not if the printer isn\u2019t hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.",
        "Hey.",
        "Mmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Sure.",
        "Coffee Jim.",
        "Yes.",
        "Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don\u2019t have time. Okay, okay, I\u2019ll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.",
        "I\u2019m pretty good on politics. \u201cCalifornia is bankrupt, and California, California.\u201d  What?",
        "Pass.",
        "Pass.",
        "Lifeline.",
        "I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.",
        "Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?",
        "Is it going to be worth it?",
        "I don\u2019t need to cheat.",
        "Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?",
        "Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that\u2019s just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.",
        "China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.",
        "How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?",
        "Don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2026",
        "Yeah, I figured that.",
        "Wait. You forgetting something?",
        "This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.",
        "Here we are.",
        "My point is\u2026 that as long as people like you and me don\u2019t stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.",
        "I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don\u2019t think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y\u2019know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don\u2019t tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.",
        "Raise your cups on high. Case closed.",
        "People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We\u2019re gonna do a fun one.",
        "That\u2019s it! That\u2019s a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We\u2019re gonna jump in the air. Here we go.",
        "Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.",
        "Don\u2019t answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we\u2019re all in the air at the same time. Yes?",
        "I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.",
        "We didn\u2019t get it.",
        "Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children!",
        "How\u2019s everybody doing today?",
        "How\u2019s the party coming along?",
        "Are we over budget?",
        "No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?",
        "Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What\u2019s the problem?",
        "So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?",
        "Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?",
        "Whatcha got?",
        "Well, that\u2019s a relief. Santa\u2019s gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!",
        "My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that\u2019s what I want. That\u2019s what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Pam? Pam?",
        "Hi.",
        "Uh, because you\u2019ve been on the Lam? Because the \u2018boring police\u2019 have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?",
        "Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!",
        "You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?",
        "That was the worst joke ever.",
        "Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.",
        "What? What?",
        "Hold on, Holly\u2019s coming back here?",
        "That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?",
        "Holly\u2019s coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.",
        "You know what, we\u2019ll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.",
        "Cancel. We\u2019re canceling it.",
        "No, we have to cancel the party.",
        "No, no, no, we\u2019re gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.",
        "I know.",
        "It\u2019s not. They\u2019re not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.",
        "Well then everybody\u2019ll chip in, it\u2019ll be fine.",
        "You know what, I\u2019ll pay for it. I\u2019ll pay for the party. It doesn\u2019t matter. This is way too important. People, Holly\u2019s coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.",
        "Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person\u2019s breath away.",
        "We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they\u2019ve never been cool.  The name is Bond\u2026 Santa Bond. I\u2019ll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa\u2026 wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can\u2019t get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He\u2019s not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus\u2026 God! Ow!",
        "Well, this year\u2019s gonna be different. We\u2019re gonna have fun. It\u2019s not gonna be tacky. It\u2019s going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It\u2019s not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It\u2019s gonna be cool, sleek Santa.",
        "Okay. Sure.",
        "You never know about the press.",
        "Could he help us with some parking tickets?",
        "Well, then he\u2019s not a senator.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay\u2026  Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!",
        "Pam, no, no. Holly\u2019s coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it\u2019s a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.",
        "Yes, that\u2019s me. Come on it.",
        "There\u2019s nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what\u2019s better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?",
        "When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.",
        "She doesn\u2019t need an internet presence, you just know.",
        "What the hell are you doing here? You\u2019re supposed to be in the courthouse.",
        "And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.",
        "There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God\u2019s sake?",
        "Hello.",
        "Well, I never thought I\u2019d see your face around these parts, you old bastard.",
        "Why, you\u2019re some sorta wise guy, huh?",
        "Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!",
        "D\u2019oh!",
        "Hi. Hi. Oh\u2026",
        "Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don\u2019t wanna die! I don\u2019t wanna die! I don\u2019t wanna die!  Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.",
        "That\u2019s adorable.",
        "Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.",
        "Isn\u2019t it wonderful? We love it here. Don\u2019t you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk.  I show you to your desk.",
        "What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?",
        "This is weird. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here. This feels like you never left. Doesn\u2019t it?",
        "Oh\u2026",
        "Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah!  Oh, I love toy\u2026",
        "Well, that\u2019s understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?",
        "You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy\u2019s mom.",
        "Because without Andy\u2019s mom, there\u2019s no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.",
        "You\u2019re kidding me. Ahh!",
        "What a douche bag!",
        "Get a\u2026 yeah! Good riddance.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "Good for him.",
        "Really? That\u2019s creepy. How did AJ get in your house?",
        "Oh, you do?",
        "Yeah, Randy Newman\u2019s the best.",
        "Me too.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I\u2019m Santa Claus. Welcome.",
        "It\u2019s a sophisticated take.",
        "Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.",
        "Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.",
        "I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don\u2019t. And that\u2019s just the way it is. And I can be mature about that.",
        "What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.",
        "All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk?  Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.",
        "I haven\u2019t told you about her.",
        "I\u2019m a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that\u2019s pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, \u201cMichael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.\u201d",
        "I do. She is.",
        "Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain\u2019t Tara.",
        "What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby\u2019s very jealous of all the attention you\u2019ve been getting.",
        "Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn\u2019t that nice? Thank you very much.",
        "It is Christmas.",
        "Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.",
        "Ahhhhhh!  Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?",
        "I don\u2019t. But someday I think we will laugh about this\u2026 when we tell our kids\u2026",
        "All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn\u2019t mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.",
        "Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That\u2019s what Jim and Dwight thought.",
        "When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, \u201cMichael, I love you, but I can\u2019t do this.\u201d But then, with this other guy, you don\u2019t have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.",
        "And we did this whole stupid party for you.",
        "Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?",
        "Hey",
        "Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.",
        "Good trip down?",
        "Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.",
        "I am dead inside.",
        "Oh, hey, hey, no, don\u2019t run. You\u2019re gonna slip.",
        "Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.",
        "Yeah, well, at least he was married.",
        "No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.",
        "Really?",
        "No.",
        "Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don\u2019t want you to fall.",
        "I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.",
        "No, that\u2019s not\u2026 no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.",
        "From the mall. That\u2026",
        "Well, that\u2026",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh.",
        "Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.",
        "Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn\u2019t he say that?",
        "I think I know where he is.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "Video games.",
        "A DSi?",
        "A horse.",
        "You, are you sure you don\u2019t want a pony? You want a real horse?",
        "All right. You have to pick up after them.",
        "January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let\u2019s switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let\u2019s push through. We\u2019ll do this.",
        "Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year\u2019s or they break up. Now, if she\u2019s engaged, I\u2019m gonna go crazy, and I\u2019m gonna start attacking people. If she\u2019s not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.",
        "Michael, I know what you\u2019re thinking. Holly\u2019s engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it\u2019s not.",
        "Okay, so killing yourself.  I was just thinking about snot.",
        "Happy.",
        "Sad. To soak up my tears.",
        "Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.",
        "Sad, something to break.",
        "For you, job well done.",
        "Both sad.",
        "I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly\u2019s favorite. I hope she doesn\u2019t call us up on stage. That would suck. \u201cHey, you think you can do my job better?\u201d I don\u2019t know. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Michael.",
        "Shaaa-shut up. Hello.",
        "So\u2026 high five me. We\u2019re back. To a happy\u2026  look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?",

        "And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.",
        "It was insensitive and I am sorry.",

        "Okay.",
        "I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character \u201cMikanos\u201d, is just a little added flava. \u201cMikanos\u201d is loosely based on another character I do, \u201cSpiros\u201d, who is more about the ladies.",
        "You know what might be kind of fun?  I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened\u2026 to me. To Holly, it\u2019s been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That\u2019s what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.",
        "If-a you change-a you mind, why don\u2019t you talk to Mikanos?",
        "Ugh. You\u2019re the fifth person to tell me that today.",

        "No more brain damage!",
        "Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I\u2019m going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it\u2019s a secret, and I\u2019ll tell you.   All, you have to close right now.",
        "No, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.",
        "Andy, what\u2019s the problem?",
        "You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don\u2019t let them down. Don\u2019t let yourself down, Andy. I\u2019m gonna go back in. I\u2019m going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close.   What is taking that guy so long?",
        "No, no, no.",

        "What part of \u201cI need to pee\u201d do you not understand? I\u2019m upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.",
        "Well I hope I make it.",
        "I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn\u2019t here and I am worried that he has been abducted.",
        "There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He\u2019s my\u2026 Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!",
        "Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick.  And you don\u2019t have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?",
        "You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim\u2019s number.",
        "Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good.  Nope, get away. No, that\u2019s enough. Ok.",
        "Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don\u2019t get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute.  Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You\u2019re so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That\u2019s a metaphor I guess.  You are disgusting. You\u2019ll never find love. Yekkk.  Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen?  I\u2019m being serious. Seriously.",

        "Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.",
        "Well the number three is not such a giant feast.",

        "Anything goes.",
        "Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we\u2019re gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?",
        "Pro.",

        "I will grab you here anyway.",
        "Never.",
        "I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can\u2019t stop. You don\u2019t what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.",
        "Yes, it was that. It\u2019s that one.",

        "It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s great than you\u2019re basically saying that you don\u2019t believe in my dream.",
        "I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could\u2019ve been working on the Scarn Nebulus.",
        "Because, if I don\u2019t have this, what do I have? I have nothing.",
        "I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.",
        "Yeah, you\u2019re a real pain in the ass. And I\u2019m gonna go watch the movie with people who think it\u2019s great! And I\u2019m sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I\u2019m angry, and I love you.",
        "I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I\u2019ve only seen Antz, but I\u2019ll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug\u2019s Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is\u2026 I thought Bug\u2019s Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don\u2019t listen to your critics, listen to your fans.",
        "Who likes Threat Level: Midnight?  Okay then who wants to watch the rest?!",

        "No, no! Actually it\u2019s really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That\u2019s why there were so many people there.",
        "Hey\u2026",
        "No it\u2019s not.  It\u2019s not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.",

        "Oh yeah!  Yes he is!",
        "No, no Dwight. He\u2019s just being stupid.",
        "Still not seeing the problem here.",
        "It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who\u2019s here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, Michael! This\u2019ll be just us.",
        "Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he\u2019s at his funniest when you\u2019ve given him five shots.",
        "And it also helps if you\u2019ve had five shots.",
        "Whoa!",
        "Is Packer here?",
        "Don\u2019t know, don\u2019t care.",
        "Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn\u2019t be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.",
        "You did! You got burned, because Packer\u2019s back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he\u2019s probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.",
        "Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.",
        "And I don\u2019t have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit\u2026 And we can\u2019t just sit around and wait for Creed to die.",
        "So you wouldn\u2019t mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here.",
        "Let\u2019s look at this.",
        "Don\u2019t be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.",
        "No!",
        "Best day ever. Best day ever!",
        "Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?",
        "Please.",
        "Yeah, You love him right?  You love him. I can tell.",
        "No. Not me, him.",
        "Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he\u2019s funnier than you? Oh honey\u2026",
        "He\u2019s funnier than me.",
        "So I\u2019m less funny than not funny at all?",
        "Uhm\u2026",
        "That\u2019s insane!",
        "And you made Hank smile, that doesn\u2019t happen often. You\u2019re very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter.",
        "I don\u2019t know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I guess you said something weird about your daughter?",
        "You\u2019ve been on the road a long time. And you\u2019ve been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can\u2019t be peeing all over the walls.",
        "No it isn\u2019t.",
        "Yeah, a little bit.",
        "I won\u2019t.",
        "Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.",
        "Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.",
        "Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn\u2019t be apologizing to Packer. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.",
        "Kevin, do you accept the apology?",
        "Okay, go back to the annex.",
        "That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn\u2019t speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent\u2019s expectations, Andy.  Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-",
        "I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we\u2019re through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "I cannot believe this, you\u2019re sending Packer to Florida? Why?",
        "Okay, so you\u2019re tricking him into flying to Florida?",
        "You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.",
        "He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.",
        "Yes, about that.",
        "Well\u2026 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.",
        "No, nothing like that at all.",
        "Sorry?",
        "Sounds great.",
        "That is.  It\u2019s gonna be awesome. I think you\u2019re really going to enjoy it down there.",

        "No you ahh.",
        "You ahh.",
        "I uh\u2026 I actually don\u2019t know why I brought that because It\u2019s kind of priceless.",
        "Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.",
        "500.",
        "Get lost.",
        "That is how you do it.",

I\u2019m just kidding. I\u2019m kidding. I\u2019m actually calling because I\u2019m in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you\u2026 which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn\u2019t a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.",

        "Maybe.",
        "Hey you know what? I\u2019ve got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?",
        "Pam.",
        "I am not in the mood for riddles pam.",
        "No, this is romantic.",
        "Why?",

        "I had a great idea until you ruined it.",
        "How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line \u2018 I lost my head when I fell in love with you.\u2019",
        "It\u2019s easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.",
        "Heres the ring.",
        "Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.",
        "Is she not going to like that?",
        "At a gas station?",
        "That mush have been a surprise when\u2026 at the gas station you proposed.",
        "Oh yea you didn\u2019t say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.",
        "I just\u2026 it\u2019s terrifying.",
        "I know but I\u2019m still scared I don\u2019t know why.",
        "Get this\u2026 Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him \u2018Dude this was a prop in my movie.\u2019",
        "Ok it\u2019s because we haven\u2019t sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they\u2019re gonna pay anything.",

        "No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.",
        "Shhhh. Let\u2019s go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.",
        "So this is one of my favorite places in the world.",
        "This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let\u2019s go in here.",
        "This is where we first kissed.",
        "And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?",
        "Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn\u2019t love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.",
        "In-grown hair.",
        "Right in here\u2026 this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?",
        "We saved a lot of lives that day. That\u2019s where you first met Michael Klump.",
        "And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn\u2019t believe it, you thought it was so wrong.",
        "And over here..",
        "Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I\u2019d do.",
        "Let\u2019s go in here.",
        "This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.",
        "That guy\u2019s got more than he can handle as it is.",
        "That marriage would be a sham.",
        "Easy no.",
        "That would be hot. I would pay to see that.",
        "Only one that I was kind of worried about.",
        "This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with..  Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?",
        "Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We\u2019re moving to Colorado.",

        "Kahlua Sombrero, please.",
        "Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I\u2019m a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.",
        "Oh, really?",
        "And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.",
        "Do not tell my fiance I\u2019m drinking on a Wednesday.",

        "I am well, sir, how are you?",
        "And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it\u2019s Deangelo the whole time!",

        "Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.",
        "Uh\u2026 that is excellent.",
        "I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.",
        "Yes!",
        "I wasn\u2019t really sure which one of you is Chuck.",
        "Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.",
        "We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? \u201cHello. Hi sweetie. It\u2019s Jim. I\u2019m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.\u201d",
        "How you doing?",
        "Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.",
        "What is the delay here? Where\u2019s Ryan? Why is he not here?",
        "What?",
        "You are gonna bloody ruin it. You\u2019re gonna bloody ruin it because you\u2019re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed\u2026",
        "That\u2019s\u2026.",
        "Dwight. You\u2019re the vice president.",
        "",
        "aagh!",
        "Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.",
        "I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.",
        "Trick\u2026 there\u2019s no such thing. It\u2019s not even a real English duo.",
        "I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn\u2019t exist either.",
        "He doesn\u2019t even care.",
        "Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We\u2019ll just chalk it up to cultural bias.",
        "Oh.",
        "Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.",
        "How did that look?",
        "Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.",
        "Right, let\u2019s begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.",
        "Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes\u2026 but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.",
        "Allow me to solve your problem, then.",
        "Mmm.  Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?",
        "Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let\u2019s build a shrine. No, I\u2019ve come to work here.",
        "Mm.",
        "That one looks empty.",
        "Oh, is it?",
        "I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It\u2019s how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.",
        "Robert.",
        "So far, so good.",
        "Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "Oh, I\u2019ve already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.",
        "Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I\u2019ve been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.",
        "So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn\u2019t it?  Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady?  I know. It\u2019s a lot. So, who knows what\u2019s going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it\u2026 chumbo?",
        "So no one can tell me what\u2019s going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other.  But why, m\u2019lady?  Because I am your new manager.",
        "I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.",
        "Performance reviews.",
        "On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.",
        "All right. Let\u2019s get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.",
        "Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.",
        "Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You\u2019re getting a raise.",
        "Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?",
        "Then you accept it?",
        "Absolutely not. Seven percent.",
        "So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I\u2019m fairly certain you\u2019re going to like it.",
        "So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.",
        "Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there\u2026 all very impressive.",
        "Mm, let\u2019s see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.",
        "So, Pamela, I\u2019m going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.",
        "That\u2019s not really what you want. What you want is a good night\u2019s sleep, working mother of two.",
        "Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for\u2013 what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?",
        "You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?",
        "Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There\u2019s a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I\u2019ll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.",
        "I think you\u2019re amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: \u201cI\u2019m amazing.\u201d",
        "Jim, time for your review.",
        "Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn\u2019t you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?",
        "Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?",
        "I\u2019m Tinkerbell.",
        "Mm-hm. I\u2019m a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.",
        "But here\u2019s the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn\u2019t exist.",
        "She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?",
        "I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don\u2019t work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that\u2019s the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It\u2019s just random.",
        "Sorry, sorry, everyone, I\u2019m late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.",
        "Oh, here\u2019s what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.",
        "Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!",
        "Ah ha!",
        "Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.",
        "Well, yes, uh\u2026 there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?",
        "Ugh! I hate that! No offense.",
        "oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!",
        "Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court.",
        "If you\u2019d let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?",
        "Yes, Robert!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let\u2019s not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.",
        "Oh.",
        "I see you\u2019ve discovered Benjamin. That\u2019s what I call my box full of photos of Henry.",
        "God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.",
        "I couldn\u2019t afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what\u2019s ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?",
        "Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don\u2019t tell anyone about this.",
        "God, no. That\u2019s the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?",
        "Jim, could you give us a hand?",
        "Why thank you.",
        "Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they\u2019re brilliant employees, in their own way. Don\u2019t you see what I see?",
        "Yes?",
        "Oh yes.",
        "You are most welcome.",
        "No.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Hmm, no.",
        "No.",
        "Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.",
        "I\u2019m gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I\u2019m going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.",
        "Five\u2026 four\u2026",
        "Angela! Dock Andy\u2019s pay one hundred dollars.",
        "Do you want to go again?",

        "Three\u2026 two\u2026 one\u2026",
        "Angela, two hundred dollars!",
        "I know what, let\u2019s go\u2026 ten thousand dollars!  Five\u2026 four\u2026",
        "Three\u2026",
        "Two\u2026  one.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "I just wanted to take the man\u2019s job, not his manhood.",
        "Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.",
        "Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.",
        "No.",
        "Which is important in its own way. So if you\u2019d just like to take a seat, Andy.",
        "\u201cTake a man\u2019s job, but leave him his balls.\u201d Margaret Thatcher said that\u2026 probably. Don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t read. Didn\u2019t see the movie.",
        "This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.",
        "Oh, oh, it\u2019s not me. No, no. I\u2019ve never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.",
        "Dwight told me about it earlier.",
        "Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?",
        "Oh\u2026 Stanley?",
        "Creed, you are a thousand years old.",
        "The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that\u2019s a vicious spiral.",
        "Erin, on phone memos you\u2019re writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.",
        "Okay, just calm down.",
        "It\u2019s the apology. I really have to insist.",
        "Stop saying no.",

        "Yeah",

        "Come in!",
        "Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.",

        "I\u2026",
        "Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.",
        "Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers\u2026 Or Oreos\u2026 Or a pizza pie or, what\u2019s another food that we like?",
        "What I wouldn\u2019t give for a big mess of tacos right now!",
        "Brilliant!",
        "Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we\u2019d probably need about what 20\u2026 $20? Or $25? $20?",
        "$30, yes!",
        "I\u2019ve never eaten a taco. I\u2019m not entirely sure what they are. As long as they\u2019re not slimy, and please god don\u2019t let them have eyes!",
        "Oh, great! Okay, oh\u2026 Oh, these tacos!",
        "Mmm! Uhh  Mmmm\u2026 Oh! Hmmph!",

        "You\u2019ve just got me started. Robert\u2026 is\u2026 a filthy beast. I mean, don\u2019t you get the feeling, he\u2019s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?",

        "Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.",
        "Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And\u2026 I have a new friend. A friend. At work.",

        "Oh come on, Andy!",
        "You\u2019re dirty, you stink of booze, you\u2019re limping inexplicably.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, get out, skeleton man!",

        "Today, I launch my big charity initiative \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOperation Give Back'. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I'd like to see him piss on that one.",
        "With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.",
        "There\u2019s four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?",
        "Dwight, what about you?",
        "Thank you, Andy.",
        "Dwight, you will be participating.",
        "Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.",
        "Great, thank you.",
        "Oh, for goodness\u2019 sake, Dwight.",
        "Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.",

        "Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office?",
        "When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.",
        "Looking for this?",
        "Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it\u2019s mine now because I stole it.",
        "Didn\u2019t you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there\u2019s been theft. That means, you\u2019re not serious or\u2026 someone\u2019s getting their hand cut off.",
        "I know. So, it\u2019s better that you pick another charity.",
        "In that case, you\u2026  will have to chop off my hand.",
        "I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people\u2019s hands.",

        "Yeah, you're right. This man needs to be apprehended.",
        "You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.",

        "The pill is mine.",
        "Get her out.",
        "Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It's for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.",

        "Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he's a good man and that I hope he feels better.",

        "Well why don\u2019t I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.",
        "And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I\u2019m Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin\u2019s senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.",

        "Uh, excuse me.  I\u2019m being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?",
        "I\u2019m so sorry we\u2019re going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute.  Your voice, it\u2019s sounding a little feminine.",
        "Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?",
        "I\u2019m getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?",
        "Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc\u2026Sandra Mick",
        "Let\u2019s get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?",
        "Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?",
        "Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?",
        "Are you insulting my guests?",
        "The fallout from this morning\u2019s revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%.  Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?",
        "For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich.  Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company\u2019s stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson .",
        "Oh, Mr. Shrute, there\u2019s really no need to, um involve Mr\u2026 Wallace.",
        "Ew. That\u2019s not good.",
        "I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?",
        "Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I\u2019ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.",
        "And then we thought we\u2019d \u2026 I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t  carry on with that face. Look at it. I\u2019m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he\u2019s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.",

        "No.",

        "Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.",
        "Were they angry?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yes!",
        "Is It?",
        "Well, then, why don\u2019t we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?",
        "Too weird.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, the\u2013Uh, the Scranton who?",
        "Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can\u2019t, I mean, I understand.",
        "Oh, it sounds like the party\u2019s starting up out there.",
        "Shh.",
        "Shh.",

        "No\u2026more\u2026talking.",
        "Yes.",
        "No.",
        "Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard\u2019s pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.",
        "Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn\u2019t look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.",
        "Aw, poor Darryl. I can\u2019t bear to see him suffer like this.",
        "Listen, let\u2019s try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.",
        "Or what\u2019s her name.",
        "Let\u2019s get Darryl Val.",
        "Quite enormous.",
        "No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter\u2019s soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you\u2019re all you need. One day, you\u2019re alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?",
        "Darryl, looking good!",
        "No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?",
        "Absolutely not!",
        "Whoo!",
        "A-bam!  My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I\u2019ve tried so far is Alpine Select!",
        "Whoo!",
        "And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we\u2019re going to be in so much trouble!",
        "Whoo!",
        "Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don\u2019t you just have some more coffee?",
        "So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?",
        "Wow.",
        "Oh.",
        "You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.",
        "Well done, you two.",
        "Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. \u201cOur social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.\u201d I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.",
        "Loyalty is exactly right.",
        "Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let\u2019s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?",
        "Darryl is \u201cdating\u201d Dunder Mifflin.",
        "But he\u2019s flirting with Jim\u2019s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.",
        "I\u2019m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let\u2019s\u2013 let\u2019s use an example. Take Erin. Erin\u2019s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.",
        "So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?",
        "No, let\u2019s\u2013 let\u2019s\u2013 let\u2019s not say Creed. Let\u2019s say Mr. X.",
        "I suppose that will\u2013 that will be all right, yeah.",
        "Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You\u2019re welcome, Andy. And you\u2019re welcome, my own ass.",
        "Oh, thank you. I don\u2019t know, I sort of thought\u2013",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t know. Okay.",
        "Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I\u2013 I just sort of felt I owed him one.",
        "I didn\u2019t really think about it like that.",
        "\u201cWhat we have\u201d?",
        "I just remembered\u2026 I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.",
        "I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.",
        "Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.",
        "Nope.",
        "Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault.",
        "Here\u2019s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.",
        "They\u2019re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.",
        "Have you seen Darryl?",
        "Mmm.",
        "I am in too, Pam.",
        "Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.",
        "All right then, they\u2019re bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.",
        "Well, this is getting us nowhere.",
        "Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let\u2019s talk about this mural business.",
        "So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?",
        "The first \u2018sorry\u2019 sounded sincere.",
        "I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.",
        "Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.",
        "What?",
        "My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn\u2019t he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra.",
        "Oh, come on!",
        "Turns out, I can\u2019t even be in a pretend relationship.",
        "I\u2019m not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don\u2019t you?",
        "Um.",
        "Oh no.",
        "No no no no.",
        "No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.",
        "For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don\u2019t want to hear it!",
        "Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.",
        "He\u2019s doing it.",
        "well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal?  One week?  Ok, two weeks?  Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn\u2019t that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.",
        "I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.",
        "Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.",

        "Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we\u2019re smart people.",
        "Excellent question, genius. It\u2019s because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.",
        "Well?",
        "Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you\u2019re smart?",
        "Exactly!",
        "We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.",
        "We would just like to know what\u2019s happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?",

        "How long do you take to pee?",
        "Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.",
        "Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I\u2019m in the mob?",

        "Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there\u2019s not the usual balance between \u201csane and others.\u201d Toby has mentally checked out since June. It\u2019s a very dangerous time. The \u201ccoalition for reason\u201d is extremely weak.",
        "What? What?",
        "It\u2019s, it\u2019s a completely different name!",
        "No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.",

        "Hey.",

        "Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall.  Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.",

        "Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?",
        "Yep.",
        "No thanks. You got a package.",
        "Um, Pam plus Spam plus\u2026?",
        "Right.",
        "It was great.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.",
        "What?",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "Oh\u2026 I don\u2019t know.",
        "No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bird.",
        "Open the door up!",
        "Thanks!",
        "A little.",
        "",
        "You\u2019re gonna throw my things on the ground?",
        "\u2026back so soon.",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.",
        "Are you kidding?",
        "Somebody did something bad to Michael\u2019s carpet. Maybe that\u2019s all we need to know.",
        "That doesn\u2019t seem fair.",
        "What\u2019s our punishment?",
        "Hey, Jim.  It\u2019s Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael\u2019s there and it\u2019s horrible.  Anyway, I\u2019m bored.  Come back!",
        "Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can\u2019t see Michael\u2019s head.  It\u2019s working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.",
        "Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.",
        "I\u2019ll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is \u2026 okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would\u2019ve happened, so thank you.",
        "Hey, what\u2019s that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.",
        "Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I\u2019m not messing this up, so I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.",
        "Calling from my cell phone.  I don\u2019t know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael\u2019s carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.",
        "Today\u2019s a \u2018women in the workplace\u2019 thing. Jan\u2019s coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about\u2026 um\u2026 I don\u2019t really know what. But Michael\u2019s not allowed in. She said that about five times.",
        "Jan.",
        "Michael\u2019s still at the door.",
        "Mmmhmm.",
        "I don\u2019t know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um\u2026 I mean we get along great. Fine. Um\u2026 I guess the person I have the most in common with is\u2026",
        "Well\u2026 I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it\u2026 stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um\u2026 More seriously though, a husband that I love\u2026 Roy. And I love to draw. And I\u2026 I did a little in college and I\u2019d still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Well\u2026 I have a job right now, so I can\u2019t really take time off\u2026",
        "Well\u2026 it\u2019s just that the weekends aren\u2019t good because, um\u2026",
        "Hey.",
        "How\u2019s it going down there?",
        "Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.",
        "No.",
        "Almost.",
        "Um\u2026 but hey? Something kind of cool. There\u2019s this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.",
        "Um\u2026",
        "It\u2019s really cool.",
        "Dreams are just that. They\u2019re dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It\u2019s nice but\u2026 um\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.",
        "How did you know?",
        "Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.",
        "Roy\u2019s right. There\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019s going to lead to anything anyway.",
        "What? You have something you want to say?",
        "Oh, excuse me! I\u2019m fine with my choices!",
        "Yeah.",
        "It\u2019s impractical. I\u2019m not going to try to get a house like that. Um\u2026 they don\u2019t even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I\u2019m never going to\u2026 .",
        "You did?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "How about that one?",
        "You did?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "How about that one?",
        "I really like Valentine\u2019s Day in this office. It\u2019s kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight\u2019s head on it, it was horrifying and funny and\u2026",
        "Phyllis.",
        "Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.",
        "That\u2019s OK.",
        "Guess what?",
        "That\u2019s great.",
        "OH, Holy God!",
        "You can\u2019t fire me, Dwight, just \u2019cause Michael\u2019s not here.",
        "You need to get something for your girlfriend.",
        "Tightly wound?",
        "Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.",
        "No, not like a ham. It\u2019s about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.",
        "That you remember her.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oscar.",
        "Join the club.",
        "Hey.",
        "I guess, yeah.",
        "Nothing, it\u2019s just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.",
        "I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you\u2019d get me <i>something</i> for Valentine\u2019s Day.",
        "Heading out?",
        "Bye.",
        "Night Phyllis.",
        "Michael\u2019s got a few tricks for Valentine\u2019s Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he\u2019s got a great line. \u201cMe so thorny.\u201d",
        "Where is she?",
        "Cool.",
        "I\u2019m gonna spend it with my fiance.",
        "What are you guys doing?",
        "Nice.",
        "Are you sad that Dwight beat you?",
        "Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?",
        "Oh! I\u2026 uh\u2026 yeah. Um\u2026 I\u2019ll uh show them to you later.",
        "Ok, cool.",
        "I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um\u2026 just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then\u2026 I just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to offend\u2026 Angela\u2026 or someone.",
        "Mom, I\u2019m sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my\u2026",
        "Do we know anyone who was in the accident?",
        "You mean Toastmasters?",
        "Yeah, the bride doesn\u2019t really do\u2026 Have you ever been to a wedding?",
        "Roy has a connection. It\u2019s nicer than you think.",
        "Of course. He\u2019s one of my closest friends.",
        "Maybe we\u2019ll use a DJ. That\u2019s the one thing Roy\u2019s in charge of for this wedding but all he\u2019s managed to do is set a date.",
        "Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It\u2019s obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just\u2026",
        "Australia? I have always wanted to go there?",
        "That\u2019s awesome. Where are you staying?",
        "When are you leaving?",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh yeah. That\u2019s too bad.",
        "It\u2019s ok. I got it.",
        "Yes, but they are both in danger.",
        "The ones that say \u201clove\u201d on them?",
        "Oh. Doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.",
        "Is that okay?",
        "I\u2019m looking forward to \u2018Take Your Daughter to Work\u2019 day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I\u2019m getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. \u2026Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.",
        "Oh, I have more.",
        "Oh, Michael. You can\u2019t be nasty today.  \u2018Cause of the\u2026",
        "I reminded you last night.",
        "Don\u2019t you think you should say something?",
        "Michael, I think that as the boss you should really\u2014",
        "Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It\u2019s actually pretty cool.",
        "I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.",
        "That is!",
        "He\u2019s not coming out. He won\u2019t pick up the phone.",
        "So, Melissa\u2026 I met your mom a couple times. She\u2019s <i>so</i> nice.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "Sure.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "It\u2019s not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?",
        "Really?",
        "Okay. Um\u2026 here it is. Don\u2019t put your fingers in there.  Cool huh?",
        "Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.",
        "I know.",
        "I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer.",
        "My theory is that\u2026",
        "I like extra cheese, too.",
        "Yeah. Do you like to draw, Abby?",
        "Me, too.",
        "Okay. It\u2019s been a little more tiring than I thought.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Happy birthday Michael.",
        "I said happy birthday.",
        "One\u2019s good.",
        "Michael wants a strippergram?",
        "Michael, I have Jan on the line.",
        "I can sign for it.",
        "When does he hear?",
        "Ohh\u2026 poor Kevin.",
        "If I knew I had a week to live, I would\u2026 probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And\u2026 I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. \u2026It would be a pretty busy week.",
        "\u2026I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?",
        "Sixty-nine cup of noodles.",
        "And his favorite lunch.",
        "You use fabric softener?",
        "No, I do.",
        "We should probably head back.",
        "You dare me? How old are you?",
        "Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.",
        "Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you\u2026",
        "Oh I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.",
        "I hate you.",
        "No.",
        "Who is that?",
        "I got it.",
        "Michael?",
        "This is from all of us.",
        "Michael\u2019s birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don\u2019t know\u2026 It was a good day.",
        "Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he\u2019ll look up at me from his desk and he\u2019ll just be someone else. Like he\u2019ll go um,  that\u2019s supposed to be Phyllis.  I can\u2019t do it as good as he can.",
        "He does everyone in the office.",
        "Jinx! Buy me a coke.",
        "No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.",
        "Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.",
        "Sorry, that\u2019s not my problem.",
        "Hey guys, what\u2019s going on?",
        "Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room.  But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation.",
        "I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.",
        "Uh, hmmm.",
        "Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.",
        "What?  Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something.  You look like you have something really important to say and you just can\u2019t for some reason.  Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything.",
        "Here.  Just buy it from me. I haven\u2019t talked to you in hours and it\u2019s been weird and I really want to know what the hell\u2019s going on with Dwight.",
        "Hey.",
        "Ten minutes.",
        "Kevin.",
        "Do someone else.",
        "Angela.",
        "The eyebrow.",
        "I won\u2019t. It\u2019s just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?",
        "I know that I shouldn\u2019t have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.",
        "And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.",
        "Has she been on the phone the whole time?",
        "No.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, thanks!",
        "Uh\u2026",
        "There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but \u2026  it\u2019s my wedding. And I don\u2019t want anyone there who has called me a hussy.",
        "Win!",
        "How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?",
        "Win.",
        "Win",
        "Hey, Angela. I didn\u2019t have your zip code.",
        "Nice.",
        "Um\u2026 let\u2019s move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?",
        "Wait, what did it say?",
        "I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I\u2019ve been really nice to her\u2026 and I haven\u2019t told anyone. And what the hell?!",
        "Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!",
        "I find that hard to believe\u2026 considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.",
        "I can\u2019t believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.",
        "Don\u2019t take her side.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Angela, I want to talk to you about something.",
        "I am.  It\u2019s about the Save The Date.",
        "What?!",
        "Okay.",
        "Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it\u2019s the Sheriff. He said that it\u2019s really important. It\u2019s regarding your desk. I\u2019ll transfer.",
        "That\u2019s not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?",
        "It\u2019s a nice tux.",
        "Come on, it\u2019ll be fun, and besides, I\u2019m a roulette expert.",
        "No, they stopped making that show.",
        "No, that\u2019s Afghan.",
        "Oh, nothing.",
        "They\u2019re wedding bands.",
        "Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he\u2019s concentrating more on the bachelor party now.",
        "There\u2019s a KISS cover band in here.",
        "I\u2019m pretty happy these days. I\u2019m getting married soon and I\u2019m getting along with everybody at work.",
        "I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.",
        "Have three stages, yeah.",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh, wait. That\u2019s Kevin. On the drums.",
        "On the drums! On the drums!",
        "Oh, my\u2026",
        "No! No!",
        "No, come back! No, no, no!",
        "Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.",
        "Michael, Carol Stills for you.",
        "Carol Stills.",
        "Your realtor.",
        "It\u2019s still me.",
        "Sometimes I don\u2019t put Michael through until he\u2019s already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.",
        "Carol, you\u2019re on with Michael.",
        "Michael, Jan\u2019s on line two.",
        "It\u2019s still me. Uh, Jan, here\u2019s Michael.",
        "Oh, my God!",
        "\u201cYeah, right,\u201d what?",
        "I have good cards.",
        "Mhmm, And I\u2019m gonna take you all-in.",
        "Straight.",
        "It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll see you at home.",
        "Okay.",
        "Bye! Hey.",
        "Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.",
        "About when you want to give me more of your money?",
        "Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I\u2019m feeling kind of good tonight.",
        "What?",
        "What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?",
        "Well, I um\u2026 I\u2026 I can\u2019t.",
        "You have no idea\u2026",
        "\u2026what your friendship means to me.",
        "I can\u2019t. I\u2019m really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It\u2019s probably my fault.",
        "About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn\u2019t know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don\u2019t know, mom, he\u2019s my best friend.  Yeah, he\u2019s great.  Yeah, I think I am.  I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim\u2026",
        "Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he\u2019s making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I\u2019d like to choose a different adjective.",
        "Me too.  \u2026I think we\u2019re just drunk.",
        "No\u2026  Jim\u2014",
        "Chicken.",
        "Excellent, thanks.",
        "Yeah, I didn\u2019t go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I can\u2019t really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I\u2019m, I\u2019m doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I\u2019m taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.",
        "Michael, Dwight\u2019s looking at gay pornography on his computer.",
        "Yup.",
        "I\u2019m\u2026 painting my new apartment tonight.",
        "Yes.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Right.",
        "What do I think? I think everybody should stay out of everybody\u2019s personal business!",
        "Yeah?",
        "No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "What was Oprah about?",
        "That\u2019s a really big decision.",
        "Maybe you should wait before you adopt.",
        "Or not adopt.",
        "Roy\u2019s sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.",
        "You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You probably won\u2019t.",
        "No, Michael.",
        "No, Michael.",
        "Sure.",
        "This.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yes, I have a date. He\u2019s a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I\u2019m kind of nervous. I haven\u2019t been on a first date in nine years\u2026 probably shouldn\u2019t broadcast that.",
        "I\u2019ll probably just wear this.",
        "Um\u2026",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Hey! What\u2019s up?",
        "Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He\u2019s not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too.  Sorry. What\u2019s up?",
        "Okay. Well, if you think of it, I\u2019ll be here.",
        "So how do you come up with your cartoons?",
        "You dream in cartoons? How fun!",
        "Huh.",
        "Freedom fries. Yeah.",
        "Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.",
        "More freedom fries.",
        "That\u2019s great.",
        "I went on a date. It wasn\u2019t a love connection, um\u2026 I think when I like someone again, I\u2019ll just kinda know.",
        "Popcorn anyone?",
        "Anyone else?  Nooo.",
        "Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it\u2019s been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.",
        "Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here.",
        "Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um\u2026 just get new clothes.",
        "Ok.",
        "Really?  I don\u2019t know.",
        "Not at work, I\u2019ll try it on\u2014",
        "\u2026noooo",
        "It\u2019s too much.",
        "I\u2019m gonna return it.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I have this little vacuum cleaner that\u2019s broken.  If Dwight doesn\u2019t work out, maybe that could be manager.",
        "What?",
        "Please go back to your desk.",
        "Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I\u2019m gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it\u2019ll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren\u2019t pajamas.",
        "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. \u2026 Uh, sure, I\u2019ll get him for you.  It\u2019s Jan for you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael\u2019s been suspicious.",
        "Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?",
        "But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.",
        "With cream and sugar?",
        "The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?",
        "Is there anything I can do?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh.  Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh.  I would like a break.",
        "Great.",
        "I think so.  I don\u2019t know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.",
        "You waited for me?",
        "Let\u2019s see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.",
        "Is it for the bird?",
        "I have it covered.",
        "If you wanna do something for the funeral\u2026",
        "Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.",
        "Do you have it with you?",
        "Did I wake up this morning thinking I\u2019d be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.",
        "Actually, I have it.",
        "I\u2019d also like to say a few words if that\u2019s okay.",
        "What do we know about this bird?  You might think, \u201cNot much.  It\u2019s just a bird.\u201d  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it\u2019s that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.",
        "And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don\u2019t think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",
        "An impression, then.  Lastly, we can\u2019t help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn\u2019t mean he was alone.  Because I\u2019m sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.",
        "Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within\u2026 on the wings of love \u2026",
        "Hi.",
        "Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I\u2019ve never met.",
        "Closer to the epicenter, I guess.",
        "Really?",
        "Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019d love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d",
        "I should probably head back in.",
        "But, umm, thanks for the break.",
        "Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, \u201cBecause the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.\u201d",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m\u2026",
        "It\u2019s weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it\u2019s like he\u2019s five.",
        "Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It\u2019s really not a big deal. To some people it is.",
        "Michael.",
        "Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.",
        "Hey, why don\u2019t you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I\u2019ll just bring you a pretzel.",
        "You know, I just think it\u2019s really important that you be productive today.",
        "Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?",
        "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He\u2019s, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.",
        "Night.",
        "20 past 5.",
        "PM.",
        "These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?",
        "This is a huge sale.",
        "Night, Michael.",
        "Dunder Mifflin.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh.",
        "I had to work late. Jan\u2019s making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.",
        "Yeah, totally. So\u2026",
        "Do you\u2026",
        "Uh, no, I um. Everything\u2019s pretty much the same here.",
        "A little different. What time is it there?",
        "Oh, yeah. Right.",
        "I don\u2019t know. It felt far.",
        "What?",
        "I type 90.",
        "It\u2019s true.",
        "70? How many do you type?",
        "Come on. Tell me.",
        "You have to tell me now.",
        "No, it\u2019s, that\u2019s respectable.",
        "So ok. I\u2019m watching the movie, by myself\u2026",
        "Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home\u2026",
        "And, I\u2019m freaking out.",
        "That movie is so scary!",
        "But I\u2019m holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.",
        "Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don\u2019t put the pictures on the box.",
        "Would I make that up?",
        "Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.",
        "I have one kitchen.",
        "It\u2019s actually\u2026",
        "Three kitchens?",
        "Hey, Ryan, are you ok?",
        "Um. Ok, bye.",
        "No, I was um\u2026",
        "You have to go?",
        "No, I should probably go too.",
        "I mean, yeah.",
        "Bye Jim.",
        "It\u2019s like mommy and daddy are fighting. Except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier.",
        "Dwight is taking Ryan on a sales call today. So if we find Ryan\u2019s body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow, I owe Jim $30. It\u2019s an old bet, but a deal\u2019s a deal.",
        "Hey, let\u2019s focus today. Make today all about focus. I\u2019ll help you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Really you do. I love the material.",
        "I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t decided yet.",
        "I just feel kind of tired, you know.",
        "Maybe. I just \u2026I don\u2019t really have anyone to go with.",
        "Very official.",
        "I decided to come. Uh\u2026 I feel a little under-dressed\u2026 but at least I\u2019m not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?",
        "Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.",
        "Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?",
        "It\u2019s hot in there. How\u2019s the naan?",
        "I am. You should come dance with us.",
        "No one.",
        "Here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh\u2026 no.",
        "Well, you were never really engaged.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "I\u2019m rejecting your\u2026",
        "\u2026kiss.",
        "If you sit in the back.",
        "You say one more word; I\u2019m stopping the car.",
        "Michael, you\u2019re on with Jan.",
        "Michael?",
        "Your shirt is buttoned wrong.",
        "Are you okay?",
        "What did Jan want?",
        "What can\u2019t you tell me?",
        "What?!",
        "You just said that we\u2019re gonna be gone\u2026?",
        "Michael, what\u2019s going on?",
        "It\u2019s a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, \u201cDunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.\u201d So, maybe that\u2019ll stop now.",
        "Oh, good\u2026 you\u2019re bringing Dwight.",
        "He\u2019s not here. I don\u2019t know where he is.",
        "Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?",
        "Sure, uh, Jan\u2026 um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?",
        "Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?",
        "I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.",
        "That\u2019s, um\u2026 I hadn\u2019t thought about it, huh.",
        "Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs\u2026 so, good news, right?",
        "No thanks, guys.",
        "Have fun though.",
        "Really? Where did you hear that?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, me too.",
        "Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There\u2019s another annoying boss, another desk, I\u2019d have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.",
        "Hey!",
        "How\u2019d the run go?",
        "That\u2019s great!",
        "Because he accomplished something.",
        "Really, Dwight? How fast are you?",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, I\u2019ll just time him later.",
        "Yeah. Are you ready?",
        "Set",
        "Go!",
        "Am I being mean to Dwight? I don\u2019t know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn\u2019t even a stopwatch. It\u2019s a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company.  Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you\u2019re going to beat Toby.",
        "I should probably get back to work.",
        "Good morning!",
        "Okay.",
        "Yes! I\u2019m in a good mood today! I\u2019m excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That\u2019s always a thing that makes people happy\u2026 to have an old friend back.",
        "Hi!",
        "I\u2019m Pam.",
        "Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.",
        "Oh my god! It\u2019s really you!",
        "I know. I don\u2019t care.",
        "It\u2019s really good to see you.",
        "You won\u2019t be disappointed.",
        "Hey.",
        "What happened to grape soda?",
        "Oh. You\u2019ve changed so much.",
        "So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or\u2026 you want to grab a coffee or something after work?",
        "Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.",
        "Yeah. I know, me too.",
        "The day\u2019s going fine. It\u2019s been a little chaotic but it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s great! A lot of distractions. But, it\u2019s good.",
        "Hey!",
        "Uh\u2026 no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.",
        "What\u2019s up?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Oh. That\u2019s totally cool. You can do whatever you want.",
        "We\u2019re friends. We\u2019ll always be friends.",
        "It\u2019s good to have you back.",
        "This is weird with you facing the other way.",
        "That\u2019s Stanley Hudson.",
        "He\u2019s one of our salesmen.",
        "Oh very.",
        "Hmm, that is\u2026 Janet Fenstermaker.",
        "You should say hi. Use her full name.",
        "Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war.",
        "For both sides. Whoever paid more.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ohhhh! She\u2019s absolutely adorable!",
        "\u2026Oh, sorry. He\u2019s\u2013he\u2019s dressed all in pink.",
        "\u2026Oh. That\u2019s\u2026 fun for him.",
        "Who is it?",
        "Why would anyone go to jail for that?",
        "Okay. Angela?",
        "My dad.",
        "What was prison like?",
        "Yeah, some days I never go outside.",
        "They have art classes?",
        "Kinda sounds like\u2026 prison\u2019s\u2026 better than Dunder-Mifflin.",
        "Wow\u2026 I\u2013",
        "Wow. That was\u2026 wow.",
        "Michael, it\u2019s freezing out.",
        "Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?",
        "Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.",
        "Merry Christ\u2013 NO! Why\u2026 why did you bring that here?",
        "Dwight, what uh\u2026",
        "Well, get it out of here.",
        "I would like it off my desk.",
        "Can I help you, Michael?",
        "It\u2019s behind you.",
        "Michael?",
        "I didn\u2019t, it\u2019s from corporate.",
        "Yup.",
        "Psst. Jim.  Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I\u2019ll just tell you.",
        "For the past few months I\u2019ve been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.",
        "They\u2019re considering him for a top secret mission. There\u2019s his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he\u2019d never ever tell.",
        "So\u2026 here\u2019s the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is.  Sorry I didn\u2019t wrap it.",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "No, I get it, of course. OK.",
        "Michael, what\u2019s going on?",
        "I know.",
        "OK, well, why are you laying like that?",
        "Like what?",
        "Well.. um I, I don\u2019t\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t need to know.",
        "No, thank you.",
        "I feel like I\u2019ve been kinda cold to Karen and there\u2019s no real reason for it. I mean it\u2019s not like she\u2019s ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn\u2019t be cold to her.",
        "Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.",
        "Um, usually like that.",
        "I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.",
        "Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.",
        "That could really be fun.",
        "You guys do a raffle?",
        "There is now. We just started it.",
        "What\u2019s ours again?",
        "Oh right.",
        "Right, and if you\u2019re interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer.",
        "You can\u2019t do that.",
        "That\u2019s a great idea.",
        "You can have your snack in here.",
        "If you\u2019re using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you\u2019re doing it wrong.",
        "Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.",
        "Oh yeah, your mom would love that.",
        "Bye.",
        "Oh, yeah\u2026 Maybe.",
        "Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So\u2026 you can come by\u2026 .",
        "Our party is also starting now",
        "Good choice.",
        "We have vodka!",
        "I got goose bumps.",
        "What?",
        "Can I talk to you a second?",
        "In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.",
        "Yeah, but we don\u2019t have a power cord.",
        "Mmm. Hmm.",
        "We\u2019ll go tell everyone.",
        "Night.",
        "We should get him a bus ticket.  To make his trip easier.",
        "It costs seventy five dollars.",
        "Ohh\u2026",
        "Hey. You have a bunch of messages and\u2026  that\u2019s nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.",
        "OK.",
        "It\u2019s kind of serious.",
        "How was Jamaica?",
        "That\u2019s good.",
        "Huh.",
        "It\u2019s kind of an impoverished country.",
        "But you can\u2019t today, we\u2019re doing inventory.",
        "We couldn\u2019t do it without you, so we postponed.",
        "Oh my God. Is that Jan?",
        "On the left.",
        "Hey.",
        "You OK?",
        "You sure?",
        "Oh. You want to talk about it?",
        "Hmm.",
        "How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?",
        "Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.",
        "No, I didn\u2019t mind helping Jim with his problem. That\u2019s what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.",
        "Oh, don\u2019t worry about it. I mean, it\u2019s better than listening to Michael play a conch shell\u2026 which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!",
        "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it\u2019s Jan on the phone for you.",
        "He\u2019ll call you back. OK, great.",
        "Hey.",
        "What are you doing out here?",
        "Jan called. She\u2019s coming in later to talk to you.",
        "That\u2019s all she said.",
        "Sorry?",
        "Oh, yeah, no. Don\u2019t worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.",
        "Sure.",

        "Some of us like the walk more than others.",
        "Did you pick a new chair? It\u2019s been awhile.",
        "But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.",
        "Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn\u2019t care, but he promised me his old one. It\u2019s way better. It\u2019s one of these.  I really want it.",
        "Her?",
        "The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?",
        "Or in a great chair.",
        "I definitely remember your dinner party.",
        "Actually, I put the catalog in your hands \u2019cause you have to pick out a new chair.",
        "No, he hasn\u2019t picked one yet.",
        "Who are you putting down?",
        "Who is it?",
        "Yeah, whatever.   Give it to me. Give it to me.",
        "OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.",
        "No, I mean it.  She\u2019s really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along.",
        "I\u2019m setting Michael up with my land lady. She\u2019s really sweet and\u2026 whatever, I just can\u2019t take Michael like this.",
        "She\u2019s sweet and cute. I thought you\u2019d get along.",
        "I know.",
        "Oh I don\u2019t care, I didn\u2019t really like that place that much anyway. I\u2019ll just move.",
        "Yeah, maybe I\u2019ll just move in with my boyfriend \u2019cause he\u2019s kind of a slob, too.",
        "No, I umm, well I\u2019m not gonna, I\u2019m, I\u2019m not gonna move in with anyone unless I\u2019m engaged.",
        "Hmm, I don\u2019t, know\u2026",
        "Oh, right now?",
        "OK, so then, when?",
        "Oh, right, yeah.",
        "Ohh kay.",
        "I\u2019ve been warned.",
        "Nice job.",
        "I don\u2019t know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what , that one\u2026",
        "I hate you.",
        "Oh, oh.",
        "How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?",
        "I don\u2019t have anybody.",
        "No\u2026",
        "Sorry.",
        "No, I don\u2019t, I\u2026",
        "I just\u2026",
        "Are you talking about Beverley?",
        "Because she\u2019s not a sex model.  She\u2019s a tollbooth operator.",
        "What\u2019s wrong Michael?",
        "You do.",
        "We have peanut butter in the kitchen.",
        "No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.",
        "You can\u2019t, I locked the office from the inside when we left.",
        "There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, \u201cWhat if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?\u201d He said, \u201cIf I\u2019m dead, you guys have been dead for weeks.\u201d",
        "I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?",
        "Aw! That\u2019s great Toby.",
        "Toby, you\u2019re the best.",
        "Phyllis.",
        "I know how to throw a football.",
        "Actually, it\u2019s kind of too bad we\u2019re not coming into work tomorrow.",
        "I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday.",
        "That\u2019s the other Boleyn girl.",
        "Shh.",
        "Mmm?",
        "I\u2019m supposed to turn the lock when I leave, it\u2019s part of my job.",
        "Michael we don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026",
        "She\u2019s talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.",
        "Um\u2026 yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend\u2019s house and, I forgot my contact solution, so\u2026 I had to wear my backup glasses\u2026 Shut up.",
        "I don\u2019t have my contacts\u2026",
        "Don\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2013",
        "If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.",
        "Oh, thanks.",
        "Oh, okay\u2026",
        "I should probably get back to\u2026",
        "Entering the\u2026.",
        "No.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead.",
        "Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?",
        "Because you\u2019re very important?",
        "What does that mean?",
        "I can\u2019t find my glasses.",
        "Okay, okay.",
        "What kind of stuff does Stanley say?",
        "Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.",
        "Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.",
        "Thanks, Phyllis.  Yours, too.",
        "Really?",
        "Huh.  Maybe I will.",
        "What\u2019s it like without my glasses?  Um, well, here, I\u2019ll show you.  Unfocus your lens.  A lot.  I\u2019m 20/400.  You got it?  Okay, I\u2019m gonna spend the rest of the day like this.  I can\u2019t see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day.  I can\u2019t see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael\u2026 it\u2019s great.",
        "Hi, can I help you?",
        "Ryan!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "I\u2019ve heard that.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah, if I could have seen what he just did, I think I would have gotten angry.",
        "I think you look nice.",
        "So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn\u2019t have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn\u2019t have to play basketball. Those were the days!",
        "Um, that\u2019s all we brought.",
        "There\u2019s some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we\u2026 uh, eat a lot of cake!",
        "Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.",
        "This is Michael, my boss.  Justin.",
        "He\u2019s nice and he seems interested.",
        "I only brought the one.",
        "Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, \u201cAre you sure Michael?\u201d And you said \u201cPam! Pam! Pam!\u201d And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just allergies.\u201d Do you remember that?",
        "Okay. I\u2019ll go look for another one.",
        "My old art room.  Oh, maybe it\u2019s still here!  No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.",
        "A piece of paper.",
        "Well I think they\u2019ll get the spirit of it.",
        "Are you serious?",
        "Okay.",
        "Just checking in, how\u2019s it going?",
        "I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.",
        "Talk to you later?",
        "Excuse me.",
        "Beers? You closed it?",
        "Yes! Oh!  Um, congratulations to you, sir.",
        "Well done.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?",
        "Yeah. Can I fill out an application?",
        "I can do that.",
        "I don\u2019t know any of those.",
        "New York or Philadelphia.",
        "All right. Cool, well\u2026 thanks.",
        "And uh, I\u2019ll look into those.",
        "New York or Philadelphia.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Hi, nice to meet you.",
        "Hey, is this Dwight?",
        "Oh my goodness, you sound sexy.",
        "Have you?",
        "Dwight?",
        "I\u2019m confused\u2026",
        "Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans\u2019 funeral?",
        "So how much antigravity potion do you want?",
        "Hi, can I help you?",
        "Hey.",
        "Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.",
        "Oh, thank you! I don\u2019t know why I doubted it, because I\u2019m so clearly awesome!",
        "I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t read it carefully, I just saw \u201ccongratulations\u201d and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.",
        "So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months\u2026",
        "Yeah, it sucks, but it\u2019ll be great.",
        "Ohh\u2026",
        "I wouldn\u2019t go if things weren\u2019t so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn\u2019t go then either. So, the timing\u2019s perfect\u2026 And that is the first time I\u2019ve ever used the word \u201cperfect\u201d in here!",
        "Do you like it? It\u2019s a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.",
        "Well I was taking the picture.",
        "Sure, do you have a camera here?",
        "Okay\u2026",
        "Did you need me to take notes?",
        "Okay.",
        "Toby, why don\u2019t you open your present?",
        "Michael\u2026",
        "So what is your gift?",
        "What is it?",
        "Your watch?",
        "I just knew.",
        "Is that the police?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Wow. Look at our parking lot.",
        "Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn\u2019t he? No, he\u2019s not\u2026 Is he?",
        "Yay, Phyllis!",
        "Song parody writer.",
        "I like that one.",
        "I like that one.",
        "I\u2019m gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.",
        "Don\u2019t tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.",
        "Oh look, they\u2019re starting.",
        "Oh, yeah, um\u2026",
        "Sure. Meredith, do you mind?",
        "I don\u2019t know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight\u2026",
        "Thank you!",
        "Hey.",
        "Did you just buy that?",
        "Ahh!  I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t see you come in.",
        "Dwight.  Michael will be out in a second.",
        "Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not \u2014 not close to 200\u2026",
        "Just, we\u2019ll just keep going.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "I have everything.",
        "Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple.  What up, 212?",
        "I should really get going.",
        "I\u2019m sure it was really lovely.",
        "OK, bye.",
        "No, Michael.",
        "I\u2019m in the wrong class\u2026",
        "Oh, no. I just\u2013",
        "I can see you!",
        "This is so cool.",
        "Lunch with a girl from my hall.",
        "Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I\u2019m gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.",
        "Can you put me down I\u2019m getting a little nauseous?",
        "The nerve.",
        "They\u2019re on the supply shelf.",
        "New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city\u2019s awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?",
        "Hi.  Mmm. \u2018Cause\u2013",
        "What?",
        "Really, where?",
        "Wow, was it the age difference?",
        "Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!",
        "Nice.",
        "Sorry.",
        "You\u2019ve already disappointed him so much.  He can\u2019t be expecting a lot from you.",
        "I\u2026 listen, umm, we\u2019re still good for this weekend, right?",
        "No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.",
        "OK.",
        "Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Yes!",
        "Well, I should go.",
        "No, don\u2019t.  I\u2019m mad at them.",
        "Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.",
        "What?  Why not?",
        "Come on, it won\u2019t be that bad.",
        "Hi everyone!",
        "Wow.",
        "No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi.",
        "Sorry.",
        "So you know Stacy, right?",
        "There\u2019s no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland \u2013 this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.",
        "So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre\u2019s DeTech half an hour early so they don\u2019t have to sit on the slab.",
        "Anyway, Bogre\u2019s TA Sarah Kaya comes in.",
        "No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don\u2019t interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.",
        "So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, \u201cNo way.  You can\u2019t reserve seats.\u201d And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy\u2019s new PM pad and throws it at the light box.",
        "Yes!",
        "No, it\u2019s horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.",
        "No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why can\u2019t you just be in art class with me?",
        "Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting.",
        "Hey you!",
        "Not even. I\u2019m doing laundry for the first time in like a month.",
        "I can\u2019t hear anything, there\u2019s like, there\u2019s like machines going-",
        "I can\u2019t hear anything!",
        "OK.",
        "I\u2019m not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We\u2019re just\u2026 a little out of sync.  You know, that\u2019s all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.",
        "I figured I\u2019d catch you walking to your car, but\u2026",
        "I\u2019ll leave a message.",
        "I guess this is just one of those days.  It\u2019ll get better.",
        "I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.",
        "And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?",
        "You\u2019re probably upset that I\u2019m even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m being safe.  And I\u2019m headed home.  I\u2019m\u2026 headed to my dorm.  Not home.",
        "Anyway, um\u2026 I miss you.",
        "Okay, thanks.",
        "New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.",
        "Hey.",
        "Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.",
        "Hey Michael.",
        "Hey.",
        "Thanks.  My costume\u2019s getting a lot of attention.",
        "So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can\u2019t even take off my hat, because then I\u2019m Hitler.",
        "Hey!",
        "How are you Tom. Nice to see you.",
        "I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they\u2019re into the idea. They\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cThat Pam Beasly, she\u2019s the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She\u2019s the best! The absolute best.\u201d",
        "Okay, so here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn\u2019t in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.",
        "So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?",
        "Okay, okay.",
        "Oookay\u2026.",
        "They came up with that idea really fast.",
        "Hey guys.",
        "Hi!",
        "Yup!",
        "Cute.",
        "Miles Davis.",
        "Chet \u2026something.",
        "Dizzy Gillespie.",
        "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna make any money with art.",
        "I mean it\u2019s a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don\u2019t try now, I never will. So\u2026",
        "\u2026 Got you.",
        "For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.",
        "Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it\u2019s very subtle.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?",
        "Hey, New York ain\u2019t free. Get back to work.",
        "It\u2019s the world\u2019s tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.",
        "We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we\u2019re not telling anyone.",
        "I should go.",
        "I miss him.",
        "Don\u2019t give him Snoopy. That\u2019s mine.",
        "What was that?",
        "Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?",
        "Good luck.",
        "I love you.",
        "Jim? Jim?",
        "Maybe it\u2019s because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.",
        "Ooh, cute shoes online.",
        "Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.",
        "That\u2019s what she said! That\u2019s what she said! That\u2019s what she said!",
        "That was weird.",
        "Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn\u2019t go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?",
        "Did you do something to her?",
        "Well, something\u2019s off.",
        "Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.",
        "Right Dwight is loud.",
        "Hey, what are you doing here?",
        "It\u2019s Alex.",
        "Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.",
        "OK.",
        "What\u2019s up?",
        "Wow.",
        "Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.",
        "Jim\u2019s in Scranton.",
        "I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.",
        "Ask how he\u2019s doing since the breakup.",
        "Ask if there\u2019s anything you can do.",
        "Tell him you\u2019d like to go with him.",
        "I wonder what else Dwight\u2019s been right about\u2026.",
        "Can\u2019t believe this.",
        "I just talked to my advisor. Failing.",
        "I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.",
        "I have to stay and retake it.",
        "That means another twelve weeks.   Can you do this for another three months?",
        "I know.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah I\u2019m fine.  Um\u2026 my cell phone battery\u2019s low, so I have to let you go.",
        "Alright.",
        "Love you. Bye.",
        "I\u2019m coming back the wrong way.   It\u2019s not because of you.  I don\u2019t like graphic design. That\u2019s it.  Stop smiling. I really didn\u2019t like it.  It\u2019s just designing logos and stuff\u2026. and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home\u2026 and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can\u2019t tell me what to do. Got it?",
        "I missed you too.",
        "Uh, yeah.",
        "I\u2019m not going inside.",
        "Oh, come on!  Do you see this?  Disgusting.",
        "Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?",
        "Don\u2019t you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?",
        "Just because someone likes things clean, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re rich.",
        "When it comes down to it, it\u2019s a health issue.  I should have written that.",
        "Why aren\u2019t you as mad or interested in this as me?",
        "Are you inching away from me?",
        "Reach your arms out.",
        "What do you need, Michael?",
        "\u201cPlease hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I\u2019m too shy to tell you that I love you.\u201d",
        "Thank you.",
        "I know, can you believe it?",
        "I guess that\u2019s why we have a temp, huh?",
        "How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?",
        "You\u2019ve seen things cleaned before though, right?",
        "I don\u2019t know anything about that.",
        "Here?",
        "Sure.",
        "What are we doing at your parent\u2019s house?",
        "I don\u2019t get it.",
        "I love it.",
        "Yeah, I love it!",
        "I mean, you bought me a house!",
        "You bought me a house!",
        "Um, do we have to sleep in your parent\u2019s bedroom?",
        "And the clown?",
        "New chairs?",
        "Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.",
        "Good? Yeah, he said good, I\u2019m good\u2026",
        "Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.",
        "Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.",
        "Michael?",
        "I\u2019ve talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they\u2019re with me on this.",
        "What? Jim.",
        "Hey.",
        "So um, I\u2019ve been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing\u2026",
        "I really think you should reconsider.",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "But I really think you should reconsider.",
        "Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I\u2019m not threatening you. I love you.  But you should know, you\u2019re on very dangerous ground .  All right.",
        "Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?",
        "Well that never happened.",
        "So, I guess that\u2019s how they\u2019re gonna play this. It is on.  It is so on.",
        "Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I\u2019ve had two engagement rings, and only one chair?",
        "Aww.",
        "That\u2019s cool.  Mm, good stuff.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Michael?",
        "Hey!",
        "You got a second?",
        "Oh, good.",
        "Oh, that must\u2019ve been so fun.",
        "Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?",
        "Yeah, is that a new tie?",
        "That is amazing!",
        "What?",
        "No.",
        "No way!",
        "Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Here\u2019s what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day\u2026",
        "But not everyone\u2026",
        "Or even uses the copier every day.",
        "Yeah, right?",
        "\u2026That\u2019s it.",
        "All right, see you later\u2026",
        "Hot tie guy.",
        "No, copier\u2019s great.",
        "Yeah. I have my copies.",
        "And I have my original.",
        "So suck it.",
        "There\u2019s that ass!",
        "Woo! Yeah. Aw, don\u2019t take it away!",
        "Did somebody call Hank?",
        "You can try mine.",
        "Yeah, know what?",
        "You can do that?",
        "You\u2019re gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?",
        "Or chairs?",
        "So what\u2019s it gonna be?",
        "Let me just say, you\u2019ve been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.",
        "Hey.",
        "Thanks Michael.",
        "Yeah, I guess, since I won.",
        "I wish that you\u2019d stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.",
        "I know.  If she wasn\u2019t an alcoholic before, she is now.",
        "I knew it.",
        "I knew some of it.",
        "It\u2019s Christmas.",
        "Thank you. I knew it.",
        "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I\u2019m sorry, he\u2019s not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?",
        "Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It\u2019s actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.",
        "Quick announcement: new year, new candy.",
        "Okay, be careful, Kevin. They\u2019re kind of spicy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it\u2019s okay, have a couple more\u2026",
        "Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.",
        "Of course you will.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Have you seen her with her bangs?",
        "Kevin!",
        "Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don\u2019t even give him full internet access.",
        "No, because\u2026",
        "Hillary swank.",
        "Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!",
        "The phones are dead.",
        "Try a different door.",
        "What do we do?",
        "We don\u2019t normally download films illegally.  Because we\u2019re honest,  hardworking people.",
        "But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.",
        "My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and\u2026 it kinda sucks.  Jim\u2019s been great. But I\u2019m gonna need to buy my dad a robe.",
        "He\u2019s not saying what he needs to say.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.",
        "So he doesn\u2019t share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter\u2019s fiance?",
        "Hey.",
        "Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?",
        "",
        "I dunno. I mean, maybe he\u2019ll talk to you about some of this stuff \u2019cause he can\u2019t really talk to me about it.",
        "You\u2019re good to talk to.",
        "What?  Oh\u2026",
        "Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?",
        "What did you say to my dad?",
        "After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.",
        "What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?",
        "Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott.  He\u2019s supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.",
        "Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small.  If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle!",
        "Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I\u2019m sorry, Michael\u2019s not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.",
        "I think he meant personal day.",
        "Phyllis there\u2019s a package for you.",
        "Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I\u2019ll see ya then.",
        "Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you\u2019ve never doubted for a second that I\u2019m the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he\u2019s never felt that with my mom, even at their best.",
        "Yeah.",
        "When you\u2019re a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them.",
        "Michael! It\u2019s really good to see you.",
        "What?",
        "Ugh.",
        "Good morning.",
        "He brought a sled.",
        "Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.",
        "Separate rooms.",
        "I\u2019m going to say it anyway.",
        "This is a new cardigan.",
        "No.",
        "Can I turn on the radio?",
        "But then you fall asleep and there\u2019s nothing for me to do.",
        "That\u2019s dangerous.",
        "That\u2019s okay I can\u2026 I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll just play a song in my head.",
        "No, that was a long time ago.",
        "No, I\u2019m not even wearing that much.",
        "I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn\u2019t hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so\u2026",
        "Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.",
        "Stop it, please.",
        "Please cut it out.",
        "Michael!",
        "No it\u2019s not.",
        "So when are you due?",
        "Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.",
        "Oh, he\u2019s cute.",
        "What is happening there?",
        "It\u2019s really sweet.",
        "Uh, they\u2019re good. Uh, Jim\u2019s good. We\u2019re engaged.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I like her.",
        "I\u2019m serious. Um, I\u2019m really glad I came.",
        "Because, um, cause I\u2019ll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and\u2026 Now I have closure. She\u2019s happy and, I don\u2019t know, it feels good.",
        "Are you asleep?",
        "No, remind me.",
        "Perfect boobs,  of course I remember Holly.",
        "Okay, lets go.",
        "Yeah, screw \u2019em. Let\u2019s do this.",
        "We\u2019re engaged.",
        "Oh, wow, thank you!",
        "\u2026 Okay, let\u2019s go.",
        "So, detour. We\u2019re now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don\u2019t think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh!   I\u2019ve been driving too long.",
        "Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.",
        "You look good.",
        "I\u2019m so sorry, Michael.",
        "She\u2019s not doing it to hurt you.",
        "Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn\u2019t want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-",
        "You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she\u2019ll realize what she\u2019s missing.",
        "Yeah, maybe.",
        "Maybe. One step at a time.",
        "You can do this.",
        "Oh, God.",
        "Michael, get off the floor!",
        "No, no, no, you have to do it-",
        "That was weird, huh? It\u2019s all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs.  I\u2019m just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I\u2019m going to be doing the rest of the presentation.   Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you\u2019re gonna get. Forrest Gump.",

        "You did what?",
        "She never sent it to you?",
        "No.",

        "I could read it.",
        "Yeah, I could read it.",
        "Go get your laptop.",
        "What? I\u2019m not in love with her.",
        "It\u2019s deleted.",
        "She still has feelings for you.",
        "I can\u2019t tell you specifically, but\u2026 it\u2019s not over.",

        "No, we don\u2019t need to do that.",

        "Shoot.",
        "They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I\u2019d like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone.  Vending machine.",

        "We\u2019re in.",
        "Anything to get out of that office.",
        "Wow,  that\u2019s impressive.",
        "What?",

Which is why we\u2019re having it in Niagara Falls.   Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.",
        "Hey Ryan.",
        "So, I just wanted to confirm that you\u2019re not coming to my wedding.",
        "It costs about $75 per person.",

        "Okay, Ryan Howard, yes.",
        "Kelly Kapoor, yes.",

        "You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.",
        "To ask for directions..",
        "And you will eat whatever is fanciest?",
        "So rude, right?",
        "Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It\u2019s incredible.",
        "I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I\u2019m also pregnant.",
        "We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We\u2019re also accepting other gifts not on the registry\u2026 However much.",
        "It\u2019s awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn\u2019t Crate &amp; Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?",
        "Oh, good.",
        "No, we\u2019re not.",
        "I don\u2019t think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "Is this what I\u2019ve become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible.  oh look! \u201cMrs. Pam Halpert!\u201d That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen it in writing!",
        "Why aren\u2019t there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?",

        "Yeah, I mean, if it\u2019s all the same for you.",
        "$100 now for sure.",
        "Yeah. No, no, I\u2019ll um\u2013 the hundred. I\u2019ll just take the hundred.",

        "Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.",
        "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m asking for too much. I guess it\u2019s just the end of courtesy in the workplace.",
        "Yeah, but aren\u2019t you supposed to do that to our\u2026 no. It\u2019s great.",
        "Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.",
        "Well, we\u2019re thinking of my grandmother who we haven\u2019t told and is very old-fashioned.",
        "You know, Angela, you don\u2019t have to come to the wedding.",
        "Next time we\u2019re all in this room Jim and I will be married.",
        "Thank you, Dwight.",

        "She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh.",
        "We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.",
        "Can we take a look at the suite now?",
        "Oh\u2026 is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?",
        "I\u2019m gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.",

        "Hey, Mema.",
        "Oh. Thank you\u2026 but nobody\u2019s perfect.",
        "Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She\u2019s also my maid of honor.",
        "Oscar, it was an honest mistake.",
        "She has a boyfriend. He\u2019s out of town.",
        "Like\u2026 a year.",
        "Michael.",
        "Michael. Stop.",
        "Mema.",
        "Hey, smooth guys.",

        "I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.",
        "I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.",
        "Nevermind.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No.",
        "What?",
        "Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.",
        "Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?",
        "He tore his scrotum dancing.",
        "He is in my room icing his balls.",
        "Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?",
        "Your brothers took you out drinking?",
        "That\u2019s Michael.  You\u2019re out with Michael?",
        "Okay, fine.  I\u2019ll take him.",
        "Are you pushing me off the phone?",
        "Goodbye.",
        "Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.",
        "Look, I\u2019m not the one who asked you to do a split when you\u2019ve never done one before.",
        "My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That\u2019s my job.",
        "Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?",
        "Thank you weirdo.",
        "Okay, here I come.",
        "Thanks mom.",
        "He does.",
        "Yes. Thank you, mom.",
        "Okay great.   Yeah, I\u2019ll see you in a second.   Wait, what?  Oh! Oh no!",
        "Can you come here please?",
        "No.  No, but I\u2019m allowing it.  Just come here.",
        "Hey.",
        "Terrible.",
        "My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and I\u2019m five months pregnant that I\u2019m not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels\u2013",
        "Thank you.",
        "No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and\u2013",
        "Everyone\u2019s driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy\u2019s scrotum.   And my mom won\u2019t stop freaking out about my dad\u2019s new girlfriend.   This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?",
        "You look great.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yes I did.",
        "Go ahead.  I think it\u2019s your turn.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m okay.",
        "Saw it.",
        "Hey Oscar.  It\u2019s Pam. Hey. We\u2019re on our honeymoon.",
        "Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.",
        "Are you kidding me?",
        "Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can\u2019t handle the fact that you\u2019re calling us here!",
        "Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.",
        "It really was.",
        "Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.",
        "Frank and beans!",
        "Hi, Michael.",
        "Some candy.",
        "That\u2019s it.",
        "It\u2019s good to be home.",
        "Hey!",
        "Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.",
        "Awesome! I\u2019ll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.",
        "I think it\u2019ll be okay.",
        "Great.",
        "Frank and beans!  So what\u2019d we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?",
        "Bottle of rum it is.  Alright, shall we?",
        "Come on, it\u2019ll take two seconds.",
        "",
        "Wow, Botticelli\u2019s, that sounds like a special occasion.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I think Michael has a date.",
        "I think you have a date.",
        "Come on.",
        "Oh, that\u2019s too bad.",
        "Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.",
        "Of course.",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? \u2026Who?",

        "How could you do this to me? He\u2019s my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!",
        "Thank you.",
        "You need to be more upset about this. She\u2019s your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.",
        "Haha!  Ha ha ha.",
        "I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.",
        "I love it, conservation.  Let\u2019s start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.     No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!",

        "Don\u2019t call my mother your lover.",
        "Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!",
        "Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!",

        "Sure, what\u2019s up?",
        "What\u2019s the matter, you can\u2019t fight your own battles?",
        "Oh, would that make you feel better?",

        "Mmmmm, yes!",

        "Shut it!",
        "Awww, he did that for me?",

        "Cakes really good.",
        "Michael.  Michael ,it\u2019s okay.",

        "How about for dating my mom?",
        "And dumping her on her birthday.",
        "Okay\u2013 just\u2013 don\u2019t ever date a member of my family again.",
        "Are you okay?",
        "You\u2019re okay.",
        "No.  You were right.",
        "Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.",
        "Who are you?",
        "I\u2019ll go.     My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.",
        "Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I\u2019d hurt a June bug.",
        "I do not.",
        "I think Michael may have snapped.",
        "Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?",
        "Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I\u2019m trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can\u2019t think of one.",
        "I should just go.    Where to now Caleb?",
        "What\u2019s the news?",
        "It wasn\u2019t me.  I\u2019m not goin\u2019 down for this!",
        "Get the keys out of my purse, start the car.",
        "Oh my God, you guys, look. It\u2019s Recyclops.",
        "The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he\u2019s creating a different world for our child.",
        "A world where you truly can be anything you want.",
        "That\u2019s great.",
        "Sure.",
        "Don\u2019t do the twirl.",
        "Stuff gets around. I don\u2019t participate.",
        "I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.",
        "Can you actually fire people?",
        "Well, I can\u2019t really imagine you yelling at anyone.",
        "Oh. Ok. I\u2019ve heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, \u2018Hey, look. We parked over here!\u2019.",
        "Well, you\u2019ll figure it out.",
        "Looks great.",
        "Okay.   The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?",
        "Michael, why did you promise that?",
        "No Michael, why would you promise that?",
        "Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you\u2019ve done.",
        "It\u2019s terrible.",
        "Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it\u2019s going to get.",
        "No!",
        "You have to tell them.",
        "It\u2019s fine.  Erin, you\u2019re going to go.  And you\u2019re going to make sure Michael tells the truth.",
        "Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn\u2019t Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we\u2019ll move on.",
        "Thank you.",
        "No, wait, come on.  I didn\u2019t miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.",
        "Yup.",
        "Ah!",
        "Is it, is it fake?",
        "So Santa, what can we expect from this party?",
        "You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it\u2019s a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!",
        "Is it funny? I thought it was more \u2026interesting, than funny.   I think my water just broke!",
        "Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!",
        "Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.",
        "Have you talked to him?",
        "Matt?",
        "Mmm! Good pate, right?  Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?",
        "Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.",
        "Oscar\u2019s pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yes! They\u2019re the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.",
        "How could we do what?",
        "Twelve drummers drumming.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.",
        "It might seem crazy, but since there\u2019s no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin\u2019s highest ranking employee. So, that\u2019s where we are.",
        "For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley\u2026 although, I get it.",
        "Good to meet you.",
        "Well, maybe we can put the box back together.",
        "Yep, yep.",
        "Yep.",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh, Michael.",
        "No, don\u2019t!",
        "What do you want us to do?",
        "Because we\u2019re usually not on the same page.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, you mapquested it. It\u2019s four blocks away.",
        "We found a great local daycare. It\u2019s rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it\u2019s also really hard to get into.",
        "We\u2019re hoping our interview seals the deal.",
        "Okay. Okay. Yeah.",
        "There\u2019s a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?",
        "What?",
        "Who? The \u2013",
        "The guy we\u2019re meeting with?",
        "Hi Jerry.",
        "It\u2019s lovely.",
        "Ok, you\u2019ve got to pull it together.",
        "He\u2019s uncomfortable because you\u2019re acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.",
        "That\u2019s the weirdest possible solution to the problem.",
        "Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?",
        "Maybe, because it doesn\u2019t seem to be going super well.",
        "Nope. \u2018Cause we\u2019re really nice people but you don\u2019t seem to like us.",
        "So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.",
        "Oh, Michael marked his heights. He\u2019s grown!",
        "Michael, stop.",
        "Michael\u2026",
        "He looks happy.",
        "I just wanted to check and see if there\u2019s anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave\u2026  Yeah, I\u2019m pregnant\u2026  Great, well, I\u2019ll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.",
        "There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.",
        "Kevin, you\u2019re such a gourmand.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?",
        "No, no.  I still have time.",
        "I\u2019m having contractions, but they\u2019re irregular and far apart.  So I\u2019m not really in labor, I\u2019m near labor.",
        "If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.",
        "I cannot wait for that joke to be over.",
        "Ooh.",
        "You know the baby\u2019s not going to live here, right?",
        "Okay, okay, we\u2019re not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.",
        "Everything\u2019s fine.  We have plenty of time.",
        "Hold on, hold on.  It isn\u2019t midnight yet.",
        "No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.",
        "I\u2019m going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.",
        "Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.",
        "Five minutes apart.",
        "Okay, stop watching me.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Not until midnight.",
        "Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to make it until midnight if I\u2019m just sitting here thinking about it.",
        "Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.",
        "Oh, thanks, Kelly.",
        "Yes, this is the only time I\u2019m ever going to make this request.",
        "Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.",
        "Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you\u2019re really distracting me from my distractions.",
        "Why don\u2019t you go do some work?",
        "I know, you don\u2019t like to be frazzled.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey.  I\u2019m not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you\u2019ll try to drive me to the hospital.",
        "Okay, Jim.",
        "Everything is fine.  You don\u2019t have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She\u2019s not coming out for a while, okay?",
        "I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn\u2019t wait\u2026  Oh, God, don\u2019t be mad.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I know.",
        "Good.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, yeah, my water broke.",
        "Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.",
        "No, not yet, Michael.",
        "Oh, wow, it\u2019s almost time for ultra feast!  Where\u2019s Kevin?",
        "There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I\u2019ll get there.  And if I don\u2019t get there, I don\u2019t get there.",
        "Mm-hmm.  Yes, I\u2019m fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it\u2019s still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.",
        "Nope.  No, no, that\u2019s better.  That wasn\u2019t even the worst of them.  I\u2019m fine.",
        "They\u2019re not that bad still, babe.",
        "No, it\u2019s passing, it\u2019s fine.  It\u2019s okay.",
        "No, it\u2019s passing, it\u2019s fine.",
        "Ah, no, it passed.  It\u2019s good.",
        "Okay, I\u2019m not going.  I\u2019m not\u2026  It\u2019s fine.    Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I\u2019m not going today because I can\u2019t do it, I don\u2019t think I can do it.",
        "Oh, God.  Oh, no.",
        "Jim, we waited too long!",
        "I don\u2019t want to have my baby here.",
        "The hospital.",
        "A baby.",
        "Dwight, get away!",
        "Michael!",
        "Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.",
        "Wait, wait.  My iPod\u2019s not in here!",
        "It has the birth song on it!",
        "Jim, I don\u2019t want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.",
        "I don\u2019t know!  Let\u2019s go by the house and get it.  It\u2019s only twenty minutes past the hospital!",
        "Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it\u2019s on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under\u2026",
        "Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it\u2019s under the\u2026",
        "Dwight just listen!  It\u2019s underneath\u2026",
        "Yes.",
        "No, Jim, stay!",
        "Okay.",
        "This is happening!",
        "Oh, my God.",
        "She\u2019s incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, thank God.  I haven\u2019t had caffeine in nine months.",
        "Okay.",
        "Love you, mom.",
        "Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.",
        "Again, no pants.",
        "Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?",
        "Good.",
        "Doesn\u2019t she sleep here?",
        "Oh, big yawn.",
        "One, and then wrap around.  It\u2019s okay.  Hold that arm down.",
        "She\u2019s not gonna\u2026  Just\u2026",
        "Go.",
        "I don\u2019t know.  I just, I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s getting anything.",
        "Doesn\u2019t feel right.",
        "How does one do that?",
        "Do you want to try it, Jim?",
        "I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s getting anything.  It just doesn\u2019t really feel right.",
        "Even if she\u2019s not getting anything?",
        "No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.",
        "She\u2019s just, she\u2019s really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.",
        "Maybe it\u2019ll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.",
        "I know.",
        "Yes?",
        "Um, yeah, that would be great.",
        "So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch\u2026",
        "Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m really producing.  I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s getting anything.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "No, I mean, it feels\u2026  pressure.",
        "No.  It just feels like pressure.",
        "Okay.  So, I\u2019m just not sure if I\u2019m releasing, though.  I\u2019m not sure if\u2026",
        "Okay.  Aw, thank you.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, shoot.",
        "Shoot, she fell off.",
        "Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?",
        "Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it\u2019d be weird if you did it.",
        "Jim, Jim, get her.",
        "Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.",
        "I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay\u2026  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.",
        "Oh, my God.  I didn\u2019t even have to do the \u201cC thing.\u201d",
        "Aw, we\u2019re doing it.",
        "We\u2019re really parents now.",
        "Oh, hey, Isabelle.",
        "Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she\u2019s totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don\u2019t want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety\u2026  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!",
        "Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.",
        "Oh, my gosh.",
        "No, not at all.",
        "Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won\u2019t latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di\u2026",
        "Okay, please hurry.",
        "Oh, yeah, sorry.",
        "Okay, alright, thanks\u2026  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay\u2026  Okay, let me\u2026  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go\u2026  Yeah\u2026  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.",
        "Hi.  We did it.",
        "I used a variation of your move.",
        "It\u2019s kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she\u2019s very ironic.",
        "Hey baby, what\u2019s up?",
        "Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.",
        "He means his mopey place, it\u2019s under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.",
        "Hey, thanks.",
        "It\u2019s my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?\u2026 It rocked. It rocked my ass off.",
        "Oh. You couldn\u2019t have watered it?",
        "It\u2019s nice to see you again, Dwight.",
        "Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.",
        "No, no, he\u2019s right.",
        "That\u2019s weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?",
        "You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?",
        "Mm.  Meredith!",
        "What are you doing?!",
        "Relax?!",
        "Give it back to me now.",
        "It\u2019s disgusting!",
        "It\u2019s not sterile!",
        "Jim does a really good one. Do yours.",
        "No, no never.",
        "\u201cHey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.\u201d",
        "What? What do you mean, suspend me?",
        "Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.",
        "Yeah. And he worked here too.",
        "No, no it wasn\u2019t Andy. It wasn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not about who you\u2019ve been with. It\u2019s about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn\u2019t know what it wants until it finds what it wants.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hey Toby.",
        "Very interesting.",
        "Thanks Toby.",
        "I don\u2019t think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.",
        "Yeah. \u201cI vant to count to ten\u201d.",
        "That would have been funny.",
        "You know, maybe there\u2019s an opportunity for a joke there, like, um\u2026 like,  \u201cI just delivered a baby. They didn\u2019t offer me a guarantee.\u201d",
        "This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we\u2019re gonna work really well together.",
        "We have good give and take.  I give, he takes.",
        "Yee.",
        "Oh, no we\u2019re actually married. We\u2019re not brother and sister.",
        "I\u2019ll have one.",
        "Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn\u2019t still be here.",
        "What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?",
        "Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.",
        "Who cares?  It\u2019s not that huge a sale.",
        "Don\u2019t act like you understood anything that guy said.  Good luck, wingman.",
        "Maybe she\u2019s just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.",
        "You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?",
        "I was after your money.",
        "Yes, it was.",
        "Hmm?",
        "Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s really, really unlikely.",
        "Really unlikely. But I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s impossible.",
        "I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.",
        "Hey, Michael.  How you doing?",
        "You know what, Michael? For what it\u2019s worth\u2026 I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.",
        "Michael\u2026",
        "She doesn\u2019t want you to return the barrette. She\u2019s not interested in you.",
        "I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Michael!",
        "It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, \u201cI will when you lose the baby weight.\u201d",
        "Stanley got to go.",
        "No, Michael, no.",
        "You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place\u2026",
        "That is right. Don\u2019t make any more of it.",
        "How what?",
        "You could start by concluding this meeting.",
        "Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.",
        "Amok. It means, don\u2019t let your imagination run out of control.",
        "Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.",
        "Oh!\u2026",
        "Why do we have to see what Dwight says?",
        "No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.",
        "Michael. Okay, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.",
        "Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.",
        "And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you\u2019re in.",
        "Helene.",
        "My mother.",
        "My mother, Helene.",
        "Hmm? Oh. It\u2019s probably nothing.",
        "Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn\u2019t Michael.",
        "No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.",
        "So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online.  This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night.  This photo was taken this morning.  It\u2019s Cece.  She\u2019s never gonna do anything wrong.",
        "Hey, Michael.",
        "I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.",
        "I lied it\u2019s personal. It\u2019s about me and Jim. We\u2019re\u2026 I just\u2026 you\u2019re the only person I can talk to.",
        "And\u2026",
        "No, not\u2026 we\u2019re not\u2026 we\u2019re not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love\u2026",
        "Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.",
        "I need you to sign this! So bad!",
        "I love \u2026 this idea is neat. I\u2019ve never been. It sounds lovely.",
        "You\u2019re gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at\u2026 golfing.  Are you a golfer?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I don\u2019t know who he is.",
        "What?",
        "You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.",
        "You have to settle down first.",
        "Okay. Okay. Yes.",
        "Yeah, but you have to calm\u2026",
        "Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.",
        "Hi, Michael, hi, Michael",
        "Did she see me?",
        "What flavors did you get?",
        "Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?",
        "No, no, no, it\u2019s fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open \u2019em up.",
        "Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we\u2019re just trying to get out in front of this.",
        "Yeah, or no\u2026 well\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I\u2019d be running this.",
        "And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.",
        "Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get\u2019s like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don\u2019t know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.",
        "No, out! Get out now! Leave now.",
        "Leave!",
        "Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?",
        "That\u2019s awesome. You want some ice cream?",
        "Could he still be seeing her?",
        "Me too!",
        "Hey Michael.",
        "We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.",
        "We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.",
        "Yes.",
        "Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?",
        "Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.",
        "You were supposed to be the Lookout.",
        "So embarrassing.",
        "We will be well-rested tomorrow.",
        "I don\u2019t think those were yours to take.",
        "Did you talk to him?",
        "You talked to the man whose wife you\u2019re having an affair with.",
        "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna make it.",
        "It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.",
        "Well, it does and it doesn\u2019t.",
        "You sleep in the warehouse?",
        "Okay.",
        "It was me.",
        "Okay. I\u2019m talking to this woman at daycare\u2026",
        "She\u2019s telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!",
        "Her husband\u2019s a reporter.",
        "So now everyone hates Andy, and it\u2019s this whole mess, and I don\u2019t know what to do.",
        "I could tell Jo\u2026 or I could tell Michael.",
        "I don\u2019t know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or \u2013 I don\u2019t want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!",
        "That fast?",
        "Yeah?  I weirdly know exactly what you\u2019re saying to me.",
        "Yeah, you didn\u2019t need to actually say it.",
        "I have never seen so many parking tickets.",
        "Um\u2026",
        "We\u2019re not going for yogurt.",
        "Wouldn\u2019t we get fired for smashing all the computers?",
        "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.",
        "Nobody\u2019s going to prison, okay? Um\u2026 all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we\u2019ll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.",
        "Yes, it\u2019s totally obvious.",
        "Hey. What are you doing?",
        "Sorry.",
        "It was really funny.",
        "I love you.",
        "Why is there a circle with a line through it?",
        "Or enough for everyone?",
        "Get whatever you want, on me.",
        "I don\u2019t know. That usually works.",
        "I feel horrible for blowing Jim\u2019s prank. I don\u2019t know if you can tell, but he\u2019s mildly upset. And Dwight hasn\u2019t been messed with in a while, so he\u2019s become a monster. I need to make this right.",
        "Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses \u201cDoors closed\u201d the doors open. Or he presses \u201clobby\u201d it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?",
        "Dwight is about to get so Pammed.",
        "Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.",
        "There we go.",
        "Let\u2019s just calm down.",
        "I don\u2019t-",
        "Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!",
        "Dwight, what are you doing!? We\u2019ve only been in here for, like, two seconds!",
        "You\u2019ve gotta be kidding me.",
        "Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.",
        "I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.",
        "Well, you know\u2026 they don\u2019t call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.",
        "They do call me that.",
        "Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there\u2019s pee on the floor.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Stop drinking the water! Stop!",
        "We signed Cici up for this daycare. It\u2019s on the other side of town. The traffic\u2026",
        "Were you painting in the dark?",
        "I don\u2019t really think we need\u2026",
        "Yeah.",
        "And a soy sauce packet.",
        "Look, I\u2019m not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.",
        "I can\u2019t do this. I don\u2019t have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.",
        "Tell me I\u2019m good at sales.",
        "The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that\u2019s fair.",
        "Yeah, what happened Dwight?",
        "So what happened?",
        "I am. I am the office administrator!",
        "Oh, we\u2019re not interested. We\u2019re not interested at all.",
        "There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That\u2019s the main way. But this could work.",
        "A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn\u2019t there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?",
        "Thanks! Yeah, so I\u2019m just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?",
        "I get paid $40,000 per year.",
        "Maybe $50,000.",
        "No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.",
        "I liked them.",
        "Hey, do you have a second?",
        "Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I\u2019ve been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.",
        "And, I haven\u2019t gotten paid yet. I\u2019m not blaming you.",
        "I just think somebody lost the paperwork.",
        "Yes. Absolutely. Right away.",
        "Hey Michael, um\u2026 about three months ago, I was talking to\u2026",
        "There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there\u2019s a lot of department heads. But I\u2019m off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.",
        "We can do that.",
        "Easily.",
        "But of course!",
        "So weird that there is no paperwork.",
        "Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.",
        "Admit what?",
        "Say it.",
        "Say that I\u2019m lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.",
        "Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.",
        "Sure. Anything else?",
        "I\u2019ll get it right away.",
        "The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.",
        "Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I\u2019m really sorry.",
        "We\u2019ll keep looking.",
        "I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey, Erin, it\u2019s Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don\u2019t put Cece on the phone, because she can\u2019t talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything\u2019s going. Yeah? Yeah? It\u2019s good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it\u2019s fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he\u2019s really sorry you couldn\u2019t make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We\u2019re having a great time. Oh, they\u2019re flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything\u2019s fine!",
        "We can relax.",
        "Sounds like Cece.",
        "Oh, my God! Go, go!",
        "Why are you here?",
        "What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don\u2019t\u2026 you know, babies shouldn\u2019t have ice cream, by the way.",
        "You know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "Okay.",
        "Not together!",
        "This night was a disaster.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Get it.",
        "Let\u2019s get our juice on.",
        "No. No no no!",
        "Yes!",
        "Yeah, go away.",
        "What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.",
        "It\u2019s just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.",
        "Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don\u2019t know what that is.",
        "Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.",
        "Andy that\u2019s way too personal of a question.",
        "Okay.",
        "Michael!",
        "Come on, Michael! Yeah!",
        "Not the car!",
        "Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.",
        "That\u2019s fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.",
        "No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago.  You know I have a kid with you, right?",
        "You don\u2019t look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.",
        "You don\u2019t?",
        "Not really. It\u2019s kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.",
        "Bye, Stanley! Love you!",
        "People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you\u2019ve heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!",
        "What?",
        "I\u2019m supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I\u2019m standing next to Popeye, but\u2026 Jim doesn\u2019t want to put his costume on.",
        "We were basically Romeo and Juliet.",
        "Except where Juliet doesn\u2019t have that great a time and Romeo doesn\u2019t call back after two dates.",
        "But I\u2019ve learned to love again.  He\u2019s a cartoon sailor.",
        "And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?",
        "Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before\u2026 or sit on it.",
        "Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It\u2019s not even a history.",
        "It was two.",
        "No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don\u2019t know, you never called me back, so\u2026",
        "Yeah?  It was though, that\u2019s what happened.",
        "Hmm-mm.",
        "Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can\u2019t vote for yourself.",
        "Michael, this is a bad idea.",
        "Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?",
        "Angela as the nurse!",
        "I\u2019d remember talking about Jim. That wasn\u2019t it.",
        "I did. And it\u2019s just one of those things that\u2019s going to keep gnawing at me, like \u201cgnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn\u2019t he? I have no idea why.\u201d",
        "Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know?  Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.",
        "Oh, wow!",
        "Aww, my hero!",
        "Okay, everyone, I\u2019ve tallied the votes, and the winner\u2026 of the costume celebration spectacular\u2026 and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book\u2026 Oscar Martinez.",
        "I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It\u2019s that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they\u2019ve discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.",
        "One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.",
        "Oh, no, it\u2019s just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this.",
        "Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don\u2019t come in if you\u2019re sick.",
        "And get your flu shot. Also, I\u2019m going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.",
        "I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not going to do that. I\u2019m not going to do that.",
        "Cece\u2019s getting christened today.",
        "Everyone from work is here. We weren\u2019t planning on that.",
        "Oh, Michael, this is just for family.",
        "Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I\u2019m so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you\u2019re not Cece\u2019s godfather.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I\u2019m so sorry.",
        "Okay, thank you.",
        "Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.",
        "No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They\u2019re a great couple. You should meet them later.",
        "Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.",
        "Somebody needs a change.",
        "Well, she can\u2019t bring this up with her.",
        "What?",
        "Honey, no.",
        "No, no.",
        "We have an extra outfit in the bag.",
        "You said you checked it.",
        "Wow.",
        "We just had to add a few more tables. We weren\u2019t expecting this many people.",
        "Nope, and we\u2019re gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed \u2019em all.",
        "Hm. Don\u2019t listen to her. She\u2019s just jealous \u2019cause she doesn\u2019t get to come home to someone as cute as you.",
        "I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just hungry.",
        "Cece went down.",
        "Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn\u2019t get one either.",
        "Who the heck was that?",
        "We need more food. I\u2019ll go get some subs and sodas.",
        "Honey.",
        "Did you lose Cece?",
        "She\u2019s up! Great!",
        "Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I\u2019m up all day and I\u2019m up all night. And if it doesn\u2019t stop soon, I am going to be up all night.",
        "Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It\u2019s closer to the TV. It\u2019ll seem louder.",
        "You have a gun in your desk?",
        "Maybe I should go.",
        "If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.",
        "I can\u2019t even talk about it.",
        "I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.",
        "It\u2019s a miracle. She loves him.",
        "No no no no no! She\u2019ll wake up!",
        "Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I\u2019ve always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?",
        "Absolutely!",
        "Do it!",
        "Jim, just don\u2019t think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.",
        "What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!",
        "Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!",
        "No no no, don\u2019t. I will go talk to Angela.",
        "The reverse cycling ends tonight!",
        "Hey in there. It\u2019s Pam. It\u2019s not Dwight! Don\u2019t think it\u2019s Dwight!",
        "I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.",
        "Yes! I have been so authorized.",
        "Okay.",
        "You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-",
        "Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?",
        "Lord of the Ring stuff? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.",
        "You\u2019re typing \u201cBig Boobs\u201d?",
        "Mm-Hmm?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, it\u2019s okay.",
        "Let it go.",
        "Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It\u2019s actually a great idea and I can\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t exist before. And I know Ryan\u2019s kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I\u2019ve done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.",
        "What do you want to say, Michael?",
        "Really?! Who?!",
        "Did you prank Dwight?",
        "Well, you like that.",
        "I love you, but I\u2019m kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.",
        "Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.",
        "Ryan, just tell us your plan.",
        "Oh, God!",
        "I move we sell!",
        "Sell.",
        "Hi, Michael.",
        "Oh, we don\u2019t recycle.",
        "I\u2019m sure no one asked you to do that.",
        "Listen, I know you really like Ryan\u2013",
        "Michael, I\u2026  I hate to say this, but\u2026 you know this special bond that you\u2019ve always felt with Ryan, where, like, you\u2019re best friends or you\u2019re his mentor or something?",
        "Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he\u2019s taking advantage of you.",
        "And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.",
        "Don\u2019t.",
        "Yeah, but in a jokey way where you\u2019re gonna start singing.",
        "Okay. Go Ahead.",
        "Do you mind?",
        "You don\u2019t have to do that.",
        "Are you okay, what\u2019s wrong?",
        "Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to\u2026",
        "Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.",
        "I\u2019m not going to do that.",
        "Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.",
        "Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.",
        "Sure.",
        "Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he\u2019s worked with for years. His friends.",
        "An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?",
        "Dwight take it down.",
        "I\u2019m serious, take it down or else.",
        "We can move out.",
        "So, does anyone wanna know where I\u2019ve been for the last 2 hours?",
        "I went out to look for a better office space.",
        "Not really, because I found one.",
        "Yup.",
        "Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.",
        "Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don\u2019t undo all the changes you\u2019ve made, we\u2019re moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.",
        "They\u2019re not of Cece.",
        "This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.",
        "Well, this building isn\u2019t far, and its much newer. There\u2019s a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it\u2019s next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.",
        "Koreans.",
        "White.",
        "Parley?",
        "So everyone here knows pirate code?",
        "You\u2019ve been watering down the soap?",
        "We need everything back the way it was.",
        "That\u2019s a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave\u2026 fully clothed.",
        "I know, because you\u2019re the reason we\u2019re moving.",
        "Uhh, I think it\u2019s something like umm\u2026",
        "Umm, let me see.",
        "Oh, actually I don\u2019t know what I did with the one sheet. Y\u2019know, that\u2019s the problem. You only have one sheet.",
        "Mmhmm.",
        "I lied about some aspects of the building.",
        "There\u2019s no building\u2026 it doesn\u2019t exist.",
        "I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It\u2019s just this Office Administrator thing, I don\u2019t wanna\u2026",
        "Fail. I don\u2019t want to fail\u2026 again.",
        "And that\u2019s what you said about Art School, and that\u2019s what you said about sales.",
        "Well, I\u2019m not an artist, and I\u2019m not a salesman. So what would you call it?",
        "What?",
        "Well thanks.",
        "Hello, hello. You\u2019re breaking the law.",
        "Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.",
        "Okay let\u2019s go in. I\u2019m freezing.",
        "Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one\u2019s putting this on their fridge.",
        "Okay.",
        "I\u2019m freezing.",
        "I\u2019m the office administrator now, which means I\u2019m basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head\u2026 I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.",
        "It hardly looks fake. It\u2019s so lush.",
        "Great.",
        "Nope.",
        "Nashua got mp3 players.",
        "Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that\u2026",
        "A party. It\u2019s not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.",
        "Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.",
        "Michael, Michael, wait we don\u2019t have, we don\u2019t have the budget for another party.",
        "I honestly think you\u2019re idealizing people here again, Michael. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna happen.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yes. But don\u2019t get too excited, \u2019cause I didn\u2019t have a lot of time this year.",
        "Okay.",
        "I\u2019ve been working forever on Jim\u2019s present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He\u2019ll take a memory or a private joke, and he\u2019ll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes \u2018bear man\u2019. Wreaks havoc on the office. It\u2019s really good.",
        "No, it has the little\u2026",
        "Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?",
        "Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It\u2019s just us.",
        "Oh, do you mean Darryl? That\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ll ask him.",
        "Yeah. He works here. We all know him.",
        "Cool.",
        "Hey, sorry, I really didn\u2019t want to come in. It\u2019s just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we\u2019re hoping we could borrow your truck.",
        "Okay. Sorry. We\u2019ll uh, we\u2019ll leave you alone.",
        "Hey, how about this one?",
        "Maybe. I mean\u2026",
        "Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it\u2019s none of my business, but if I couldn\u2019t have Cece for Christmas, I\u2019d be really upset too.",
        "Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.",
        "No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.",
        "Bring her to the party. Yeah, we\u2019ll have Santa, and we\u2019ll play games with her. It\u2019ll be a lot of fun.",
        "You\u2019ll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.",
        "Hey guys, the tree\u2019s here.",
        "Who told you that?",
        "Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?",
        "You guys, I don\u2019t think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.",
        "Wow, an ultimatum.",
        "It doesn\u2019t really seem like you.",
        "So, cool right?",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?",
        "I mean, help, if it\u2019s something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or\u2026",
        "No.",
        "Yup.",
        "No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.",
        "Look at this.",
        "Jada, Darryl, I\u2019m so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?",
        "Oh, my goodness.",
        "Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?",
        "Thank you.",
        "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in the ceiling, babe.",
        "Is it\u2026 is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica?",
        "Oh, my God.",
        "I love it.",
        "Oh, um, it\u2019s just, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t have a lot of time, so that\u2019s just a place holder.",
        "Michael, wait!",
        "That\u2019s good advice.",
        "That\u2019s a sad story.",
        "Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything\u2019s gonna be okay.",
        "I shouldn\u2019t tell you this, but\u2026 AJ won\u2019t commit to Holly. And she\u2019s gonna tell him that if he doesn\u2019t propose to her by the end of the year, it\u2019s over.",
        "Really. And I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?",
        "So just be patient.",
        "Hey, sorry. I\u2019m ready.",
        "Oh\u2026 come on, bear man. Come on.",
        "I\u2019m sorry. I had no idea.",
        "Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.",
        "What?",
        "What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God!  Honey? Jim? Jim!",
        "Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year\u2019s resolution on them, I\u2019ll collect them, and then display them on\u2026 da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.",
        "It\u2019s gonna be fun.",
        "I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she\u2019s awesome.",
        "Oh, hey, guys! I\u2019d like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year\u2019s resolution board.",
        "Hey, Dwight, I\u2019m collecting resolution cards.",
        "Why not?",
        "Learn to cook for one!",
        "Well, maybe you\u2019ll meet someone.",
        "Angela.",
        "Make time for romance!",
        "I don\u2019t think so.",
        "No.",
        "I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not going to have\u2026",
        "No! Just talk to her.",
        "There\u2019s a plan.",
        "The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who\u2019s been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.",
        "Cool! Here\u2019s a little \u2018way to go\u2019 gift from Sabre.",
        "Creed. I noticed you don\u2019t have a resolution on the board. What\u2019s yours?",
        "How is it going?",
        "One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But that\u2019s okay. Because it\u2019s not about being perfect, it\u2019s about trying.  In fact, why don\u2019t we go around and confess some of the ways that we\u2019ve fudged on some of our resolutions?",
        "Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that\u2019s fine.",
        "Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I\u2019ll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.",
        "You don\u2019t have to do that, Kevin.",
        "Oh, Michael.",
        "Okay, Michael, just settle down.",
        "Kevin, don\u2019t! Come on!",
        "Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.",
        "Okay, that\u2019s it.",
        "Lesson learned.",
        "What\u2019s going on? Do you know that guy?",
        "\u201cJelp?\u201d J-e-l-p?",
        "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a word.",
        "You want some help?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "K-a. \u201cKa\u201d? What does \u201cka\u201d mean?",
        "No, it doesn\u2019t have to just be cow stuff, right?",
        "I think there\u2019s better\u2026",
        "You could have just told us what you were thinking.",
        "There\u2019s no yelling in that, either.",
        "Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.",
        "I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re still in there.",
        "Stop. Out with it.",
        "Here\u2019s the story. That guy in there is Jim\u2019s childhood friend, Tom.",
        "And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.",
        "And Tom\u2026",
        "And Jim\u2019s mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.",
        "Right. But how\u2019d you say it?",
        "Wait. Can you back up? What\u2019s the story?",
        "Bye.",
        "Aw you\u2019ll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny \u201cJim\u201d game.",
        "All right, what\u2019d you do?",
        "Where\u2019d you put it?",
        "Say it. Where?",
        "The fridge.",
        "The fridge, got it.",
        "Bye.",
        "This is Pam.",
        "What\u2019s wrong?",
        "Jim, what?",
        "Oh God! What?!",
        "Ok. She\u2019s ok?",
        "Understood.",
        "Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a \u201cAsk Pam Beasley\u201d. \u2026 Did the phone cut off?",
        "Alright, just call me after the doctor.",
        "Bye.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Cute.  Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I\u2019m not even kidding. They\u2019re pretty good.",
        "Well the first one has a surprise factor. \u201cI\u2019m a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!\u201d",
        "But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.",
        "You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.",
        "Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.",
        "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",
        "Oh, hey Dwight.",
        "No, he hasn\u2019t.",
        "No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought\u2026",
        "Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it\u2019s convent, I just thought since you are out\u2026",
        "Ok, well it wasn\u2019t obvious so\u2026",
        "Ta-da!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Seriously?",
        "Oh! Ok.",
        "Guess not.",
        "Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.",
        "Hey. How you doing?",
        "Yeah.",
        "At least she lived a very long and I\u2019m sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you\u2019re ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we\u2019re thinking about you.",
        "It\u2019s possible that some people thought it was your birthday.",
        "I\u2019m so sorry.",
        "How much did you give him?",
        "Wait. I don\u2019t have my scarf.",
        "I\u2019m missing my scarf. Oh.",
        "Yeah, lunch was wonderful!",
        "Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue\u2026 station. And what else was there?",
        "Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?",
        "Yeah. What? Us?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "That\u2019s weird. I mean, that\u2019s weird to have sex in the office. That\u2019s where you work, right?",
        "You know, you\u2019re in a meeting, and nobody knows that you\u2019ve had sex there, except for you and him.",
        "Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.",
        "No, we weren\u2019t.",
        "No.",
        "That was so embarrassing. I\u2019m gonna die.",
        "Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.",
        "Besides, we have something those other people don\u2019t have, which is a home and a bed.",
        "No.",
        "We took a walk.",
        "We\u2019re all in it, from like years and years ago. It\u2019s like a home movie.",
        "Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn\u2019t go well. We thought it was a comedy.  Everything pointed to it being a comedy.",
        "We\u2019d love to see it!",
        "Okay everyone, I know we\u2019re really excited to see this movie that everybody\u2019s in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let\u2019s stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we\u2019ll have a pure fun day! Okay?",
        "Looking at her mother on screen, horrified] Oh God\u2026  So good.",
        "I\u2019m just making conversation.",
        "I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don\u2019t wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one!  Right?",
        "Awwh, you\u2019re welcome.  My pleasure.",
        "I just helped someone out. It feels good.",
        "So you know the feeling.",
        "Hey, um\u2026",
        "He\u2019s seriously awful!",
        "United front\u2026",
        "You have a computer Andy.",
        "Ok, but listen. We just don\u2019t have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.",
        "Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.",
        "See, this is what I\u2019m talking about.",
        "Sorry Andy.",
        "What the heck! Why do you have Erin\u2019s computer!",
        "What? Erin is that true?",
        "Erin, it\u2019s not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It\u2019s not yours to give away.",
        "I\u2019m not freaking out, Andy.",
        "Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?",
        "Switch the computers back Andy.",
        "Seriously.",
        "Now please.",
        "I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s really a private place in this office.",
        "You did that?",
        "Okay.  When did people sign-",
        "Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?",
        "Okay, well I didn\u2019t think about it like that. It\u2019s just, I can\u2019t do anything about it. I can\u2019t replace that one unless that computer breaks.",
        "Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.",
        "So listen, we have to really scuff this up.",
        "Andy, this is the deal we made.",
        "We should break this hinge maybe.",
        "Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!",
        "Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse.",
        "Yep. Lucked out.",
        "Yep, super lucky.",
        "Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.",
        "Three.",
        "I\u2019m full on corrupt!",
        "Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?",
        "Oh.",
        "Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn\u2019t need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.",
        "It\u2019s cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.",
        "The signs will drive people inside.",
        "Oh, which one is decaf?",
        "Michael! Michael!",
        "Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.",
        "Why do you need more gas?",
        "Is it a good message or a bad message?",
        "Are you proposing!?",
        "Wow.",
        "Yea. Yea no problem.",
        "Yep.",
        "Michael, you\u2019ve had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.",
        "This is terrible.",
        "You know what? I\u2019m gonna get a hose. Then we\u2019ll talk about it. Ok we\u2019ll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.",
        "Hey Michael everyone\u2019s in the conference room.",
        "You called the meeting I don\u2019t..",
        "Michael.",
        "We are a family.",
        "And I\u2019ve always believed that we should all be involved in everyone\u2019s personal lives, in a very major way.",
        "So about this proposal thing\u2026",
        "Michael, she\u2019s perfect for you.",
        "So we just\u2026 we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it\u2019s safe and responsible and realistic and doable.",
        "Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn\u2019t you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?",
        "Holy s*** is that real?",
        "No she\u2019s going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.",
        "No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..",
        "She\u2019s not gonna say no.",
        "You were scared?",
        "Congratulations!",
        "Well, it wasn\u2019t an affair.",
        "But, no, but we are a family.",
        "Cecelia.",
        "Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four.",
        "Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!",
        "Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.",
        "Da-das.",
        "See, we knew it! If he just met her, he\u2019d understand.",
        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!",
        "Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?",
        "You\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m a middle class broad.",
        "Yeah\u2026  Hey, Erin, everything okay?",
        "What\u2019s wrong?",
        "Why don\u2019t you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?",
        "Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?",
        "What?",
        "Wait, when am I\u2026? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don\u2019t love him. Just be honest with him.",
        "You didn\u2019t think to mention me huh?",
        "Why?",
        "Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!",
        "Let\u2019s grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started.",
        "In costumes!",
        "What\u2019s wrong with cupcakes?",
        "Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.",
        "We thought.",
        "So this is the dream team.",
        "Okay.",
        "Should we get toppings?",
        "What?",
        "Hot fudge?",
        "You should do more stuff like that.",
        "So I\u2019m going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.",
        "It\u2019s a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.",
        "It\u2019s not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.",
        "I don\u2019t think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.",
        "So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?",
        "I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think we sh-",
        "Okay, don\u2019t turn this into some feminist issue.",
        "You know what, I think we should get some other input.",
        "Oh, hey Michael! I\u2019m just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I\u2019ll see you later.",
        "",
        "No he wasn\u2019t sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award\u2019s member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.",

        "Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.    She\u2019s got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece\u2019s godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time\u2013 but here\u2019s her resume.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh my God, he hates me!",
        "I know.",
        "Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?",
        "Oh no, do you think it was stolen?",
        "Oh wow, you weren\u2019t kidding.",
        "Look.  I\u2019m juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I\u2019m juggling with one hand.  No hands.",
        "What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?",
        "Why don\u2019t you talk to him about it?",
        "Why don\u2019t you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?",
        "So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?",
        "So, umm, is this your first office job then?",
        "Wow.",
        "Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.",
        "Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.",

        "You\u2019re back in.",
        "We could get Deangelo flowers.",
        "What have you done?",
        "Can\u2019t stay there all day.",

        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "That\u2019s regular pizza.",
        "Oh, text from Jim. \u201cThis is getting very weird. Will explain later.\u201d",
        "Oh, text from Kevin.",
        "I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, \u201cWho\u2019s that receptionist? I like her.\u201d Now I\u2019m just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, loser.\u201d",
        "Oh. Oh God.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m fine.",
        "Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?",
        "Okay, I know I\u2019ve been crying easily today, but-  I mean, that\u2019s just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it\u2019s stupid. No.  It\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.",
        "Yeah, I hate those endings.",
        "Oh! Text from Jim. \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d hmm.",
        "Kevin, do you feel OK?",
        "Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.",
        "No he hasn\u2019t.",
        "Kevin, at most you\u2019re saving a microscopic amount of time.",
        "Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.",
        "It\u2019s huge.  How much does it weigh?",
        "Erin, you don\u2019t need to call him that.",
        "Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici\u2019s favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.",
        "I flipped through it.",
        "Of course.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That sounds nice.",
        "I do.",
        "Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah! Whoo!",
        "Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman\u2019s?",
        "Where\u2019s Angela?",
        "Ready!  \u201cI\u2019m not as think as you drunk I am!\u201d",
        "Do Not Resuscitate\u2026",
        "Oh, and then this was Phyllis\u2019s idea\u2026 So nasty Phyllis!",
        "We were hoping you could do something like this\u2026",
        "Baby.",
        "Yes.",
        "Do you think you could work from this?  we made some small adjustments.",
        "Just a few adjustments",
        "Um, what should we talk about?",
        "Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.",
        "Angela, that\u2019s pretty transparently me.",
        "You know it\u2019s just herbal tea.",
        "Yeah. I think you should call social services.",
        "You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we\u2019re in this together.",
        "Fine.",
        "I don\u2019t like that clip.",
        "What\u2019s that come to? Like, what did they each win?",
        "Awesome.",
        "And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?",
        "I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo\u2026",
        "And then every morning, I\u2019d walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting\u2026",
        "And then my handsome husband\u2026",
        "Would bring me a flavored coffee.",
        "Well in your fantasy we\u2019re Stephen King characters.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "Wait, wait. What\u2019s this?",
        "It says \u201cLotto Pool\u201d, right on top.",
        "Oh come on. You really think I\u2019m gonna have a fourteen pound baby?",
        "No.",
        "Uh, buying lottery tickets online.",
        "You came in at 10:30 today, right?",
        "So. I\u2019ve been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings\u2026.",
        "And we move to the south of France. See? No, there\u2019s plenty of bicycling for you. I think that\u2019s where they do the Tour de France.",
        "Because I\u2019m never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.",
        "We came to an agreement. We\u2019re going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.",
        "Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.",
        "Just like now.",
        "Oh..",
        "What are you gonna do?",
        "Andy, somebody defaced it.",
        "Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.",
        "How is that better than a barbecue?",
        "Nope.",
        "Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.",
        "Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don\u2019t, don\u2019t say anything, okay? It\u2019s after my grandfather.",
        "Oh, wow. Funny. It\u2019s after my grandfather.",
        "I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!",
        "What are they doing?",
        "Nice touch.",
        "Yeah, she just went down.",
        "Aww.",
        "Yes, after my grandfather.",
        "Well I\u2019m having my baby first, so that\u2019s that.",
        "You think your doctor\u2019s going to give you a C-section at six months?",
        "Yeah.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Oh.  Are you\u2026",
        "Oh, Erin\u2026",
        "Um, 2?",
        "No, I mean, you\u2019re doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.",
        "Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn\u2019t believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there\u2019s no one there. So, I tell the cook my story\u2026",
        "\u2026and he said, That\u2019s what everyone sees, that\u2019s the Man In Black.",
        "Hey!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "I saw a ghost.",
        "It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.",
        "I don\u2019t know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.",
        "Pam Halpert.",
        "Is it called Ghostbusters?",
        "It didn\u2019t look like that.",
        "Ok fine I\u2019ll draw him.",
        "Mmhmm.  Dwight are you eating a stick?",
        "Jim doesn\u2019t let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?",
        "Really.",
        "I\u2019m not gonna freak her out, Jim.",
        "I\u2019m not gonna lie to her, either.",
        "Thank you.",
        "This isn\u2019t about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.",
        "No, Creed.",
        "Let\u2019s see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I\u2019ve heard \u2018Closing Time\u2019 a hundred and five times.  Still don\u2019t know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.",
        "I bet he went home.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Uhm.",
        "Yeah, do you need a hand?",
        "Are you okay, Kevin?",
        "Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.",
        "Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.",
        "Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody\u2019s nerfect, right?",
        "No. It\u2019s a jokey saying. Pobody\u2019s nerfect, like I can\u2019t even say those words right. Ha.",
        "You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.",
        "I\u2019m thinking cow-",
        "Just don\u2019t talk about the email, okay? He\u2019s gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.",
        "Just trust me.",
        "I got this.",
        "Hahhh, thanks for everything.",
        "Dwight stopped the device!",
        "This could be real. Dwight\u2019s pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.",
        "You couldn\u2019t fix it.",
        "Yes you were.",
        "I don\u2019t think so, babe.",
        "Hey Cathy.",
        "How\u2019s it going? Everything make sense?",
        "Great.",
        "Oh no, I\u2019m fine.",
        "Ok  Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.",
        "I\u2019m training a temp to be my replacement while I\u2019m on maternity leave. Oh I should\u2019ve mentioned I\u2019m pregnant. You probably didn\u2019t notice because it\u2019s impossible to tell I\u2019m so small. But yeah I\u2019m pregnant.  Oh come on!",
        "You doubt it?",
        "Why do you doubt that she\u2019s single?",
        "It\u2019s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam\u2019s desk huh?",
        "I\u2019m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She\u2019s obviously super cute I get it. But I\u2019d like to point out there\u2019s 50 pounds more of me to love if that\u2019s your thing.",
        "Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.",
        "Really well thank you all.",
        "Hey.",
        "Helen Mirren. Hot?",
        "Huh. What about Cathy?",
        "Yeah. Do you think she\u2019s hot?",
        "I\u2019m not asking if you\u2019re in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?",
        "You don\u2019t find Cathy attractive?",
        "Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.",
        "Yes, because she\u2019s hot, right?",
        "The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you\u2019re a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren\u2019t true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who\u2019s telling me the truth.",
        "Dwight, am I hot right now?",
        "What about before? Was I attractive before?",
        "Hmm. I think Jim\u2019s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.",
        "Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.",
        "Yep, that\u2019s the Dwight I need.",
        "Okay.",
        "I think so. Okay.",
        "Well, what does that\u2026 is that\u2026 okay.",
        "Yep, good.",
        "Honesty is very important to me.",
        "Let\u2019s just see how we feel when we get there.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.",
        "I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?",
        "Mike Tibbets, really?",
        "Kelly, calm down.",
        "I don\u2019t think Jim cares about his hair.",
        "Jim\u2019s on to me.",
        "Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.",
        "Yep.",
        "No, Kelly, don\u2019t.",
        "Is he puffing out his chest?",
        "No. Maybe he just said something funny.",
        "I think he\u2019s just making her laugh.",
        "Why\u2019s he making her laugh so much?",
        "Why was he making her laugh so much?",
        "Oh, hey, I\u2019ll just be a second.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oscar, Cathy has a question!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Why won\u2019t you just admit that she\u2019s attractive? It\u2019s kind of annoying that you won\u2019t say it.",
        "Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that\u2019s where we are now.",
        "Yeah, its nuts. But I don\u2019t know what else to do.",
        "This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.",
        "Wait, that\u2019s it? That\u2019s the question you\u2019re going to ask him?",
        "Ah, see, was that so hard?",
        "Really?",
        "Wait, what?",
        "Jim, you have high blood pressure.",
        "Doesn\u2019t your dad have high blood pressure?",
        "When was the last time you went to the doctor?",
        "Dwight, stop. I\u2019m not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?",
        "Come on, let\u2019s go. I wanna call your doctor.",
        "Just go home. It doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "I\u2019m gonna do it.",
        "Oh! I\u2019m going into labor! Oh my goodness!",
        "I know it\u2019s wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it\u2019s necessary.",
        ": I\u2019m going into labor!",
        "I\u2019m going into labor!",
        "I\u2019m going into labor.",
        "Here we go!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh! Oh!",
        "I\u2019m really in labor! This is happening!",
        "Oh!",
        "False alarm.",
        "Here. Like it?",
        "I can\u2019t get a fire pit. I have two babies.",
        "Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.",
        "Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us\u2026 and as, you know, as I tell it, I don\u2019t like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.",
        "Um, excuse me. I\u2019m gonna go to the bathroom.",
        "At this point, when you\u2019re this pregnant, it\u2019s kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.",
        "Hi. Wow, I really thought I\u2019d be more excited to be here.",
        "Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it\u2019s great to see you!",
        "Oh, hi Stanley.",
        "Jim.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hi everybody!",
        "How about a little visit?",
        "Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.",
        "No, it\u2019s the pacifier\u2019s turn.",
        "Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.",
        "No, but that would\u2019ve been a really good idea.",
        "No, she brought you drawings.",
        "She says \u201cno\u201d to everything. You know, she thinks my name is \u201cNo.\u201d Cece, do you want some broccoli?",
        "No. It\u2019s crazy.",
        "Shh.",
        "Oh, it\u2019s okay, sweetie.",
        "It\u2019s okay, honey.  It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.",
        "Shh.",
        "I\u2019m looking, I\u2019m looking for the pacifier.",
        "Okay, we\u2019re going.",
        "Shh, shh, shh.",
        "You want to grab her?",
        "Here we go, here we go.",
        "Jim.",
        "They don\u2019t hate you.",
        "When were you going go-karting with Darryl?",
        "Alright. Just don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure this out.",
        "Ok, drama.",
        "Hey guys!",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.",
        "Well, it\u2019s not exactly a vacation.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin\u2019s allergic to walnuts. You\u2019re allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?",
        "Aw. It\u2019s OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.",
        "When did you find time to do all this?",
        "Thank you.  Oh my gosh. It\u2019s really good.",
        "So you guys, you know what\u2019s an even more useful treat\u2026is cash. So-",
        "\u2026we wanted to say thank you-",
        "Really?",
        "I\u2019ll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.",
        "Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?",
        "Why? Does he think you\u2019re going to Florida?",
        "No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it\u2019s like wha-what?? Just do one.",
        "Well, let\u2019s hear it.",
        "I like it so far.",
        "It\u2019s perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.",
        "Total golf text. Send it.",
        "Ok, read it back to me.",
        "Good. Doesn\u2019t sound pushy\u2026you\u2019re just stating a fact.",
        "Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.",
        "I think you need to go to Florida.",
        "It\u2019s only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it\u2019ll be..",
        "I was going to say good because I\u2019ll have all the help I need?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Alright",
        "Bye. Call me when you land.",
        "Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn\u2019t the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.",
        "There.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well I\u2019m not the receptionist.",
        "I know, but I can\u2019t cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.",
        "Whoa, are those mini pizzas?",
        "Hey, having fun?",
        "Well I know how it is. I know it\u2019s a lot of fun. I don\u2019t know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?",
        "Guys, I don\u2019t like this analogy.",
        "It\u2019s nice.",
        "Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?",
        "Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.",
        "Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.",
        "No, three-month-old humans don\u2019t do that.",
        "Angela is such a liar!",
        "Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That\u2019s two sleep schedules, two naps that don\u2019t coincide, I mean, you\u2019ll never sleep again.",
        "Yes, the conference room is set up. I\u2019ve got pens, I\u2019ve got paper, I\u2019ve got a whiteboard, we are good to go!",
        "We are good to goooo!",
        "We\u2019re good to goooo!",
        "Yes, of course, we could\u2019ve just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.",
        "Watson carpet and tile.",
        "Hey, Darryl. You okay?",
        "No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would\u2019ve happened with me and Jim if he didn\u2019t put himself out there.",
        "My husband would tell you to go for it.",
        "That\u2019s it, last one.",
        "That\u2019s true.",
        "Weapons.",
        "But these were not the kind of people who use their words.",
        "Thank goodness he was there.",
        "Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.",
        "1-8-5-0-5.",
        "I just had a baby.",
        "Wow.",
        "How \u2018bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?",
        "Oh boy. Oh no, I\u2019m not laughing at you. I\u2019m laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier \u2014 yesterday. This morning.",
        "Aw, that\u2019s so sweet!",
        "He said, \u2018I did like Dwight\u2019? He\u2019s gonna fire him.",
        "Robert doesn\u2019t talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.",
        "Did you actually try your hardest?",
        "If Dwight\u2019s about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That\u2019s all you can do.",
        "Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.",
        "We\u2019ll find another receptionist. I mean, that\u2019s easy. We\u2019ll be fine.",
        "Hey, stranger!",
        "Aw, I missed you.",
        "Aw.",
        "This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we\u2019ll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.",
        "There\u2019s this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it\u2019s not \u2014 it doesn\u2019t sound cool. You just have to see it.",
        "Well, I guess it doesn\u2019t look that cool either. But, it\u2019s been up there a long time, so it\u2019s become a pretty big deal.",
        "Did a good job, Buddy. Now it\u2019s time to come home.",
        "What?",
        "You messed up saying your name?",
        "Robert, is Nellie our new manager?",
        "How can you give us performance reviews if you don\u2019t know us?",
        "No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.",
        "I like working here.",
        "Phyllis.",
        "Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager\u2019s position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I\u2019m easy.",
        "Whoa, that\u2019s kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?",
        "Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn\u2019t is because I\u2019m breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn\u2019t like a bottle.",
        "No.",
        "I think\u2026 you\u2019re a witch.",
        "I\u2019m amazing.",
        "Hey Jim. Stanley\u2019s back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?",
        "It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.",
        "Yeah he does.",
        "Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?",
        "Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!",
        "Okay, which one of these looks more right?",
        "Welcome back, Stanley.",
        "Oh!",
        "Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re throwing a party for someone because they\u2019re being horrible?",
        "I\u2019m still not sure why this woman is even here.",
        "I know, right?",
        "Phyllis!",
        "Hey, what\u2019s up?",
        "So we\u2019re planning this party for Nellie, and we\u2019re gonna make it really bad.",
        "No. We\u2019re gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.",
        "What?",
        "Okay.",
        "What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don\u2019t have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.",
        "Oh, okay. Okay, I will.",
        "Or what if\u2026",
        "We discuss\u2026  the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party.  Not mean.",
        "What are you talking about? Yes we can.",
        "Okay, they\u2019re almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle?",
        "No, that\u2019s a great idea. Let\u2019s have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?",
        "\u2018Cause there\u2019s someone already here named Pam.",
        "Oh!",
        "That\u2019s not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.",
        "Hey Hank.",
        "I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.",
        "Yeah, he came and went.",
        "Let\u2019s just- let\u2019s go.",
        "Just one. \u201cThis weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.\u201d",
        "You know, like aren\u2019t some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?",
        "Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don\u2019t want to bother you any more than we already have.",
        "Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.",
        "Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they\u2019d be good together.",
        "Kelly has been a handful in the past.",
        "But she\u2019s had a bad influence. She\u2019s like an addict.  And I just had to get her clean.",
        "Don\u2019t shake our baby?",
        "Okay. I\u2019d never heard that before. So, thank you.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m glad you said something.",
        "Yeah, they\u2019re really great together.",
        "I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.",
        "Yeah, he\u2019s so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?",
        "I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.",
        "Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.",
        "That a couple of times-",
        "Okay, stop.",
        "All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.",
        "Fair enough. Um\u2026 I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I\u2019ve said this to you before: I don\u2019t like you very much.",
        "Oh, no, no, no.",
        "Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.",
        "Read through the pain. Be strong.",
        "Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!",
        "Boo!",
        "Barf! Ugh, you suck!",
        "You\u2019re not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan\u2019s soul?",
        "\u201cKapoor and ka-desperate, he watches.\u201d",
        "\u201cHe is a drifter out to sea.\u201d",
        "It\u2019s just so dumb.  But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft\u2026",
        "Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?",
        "Smokey, the bear?",
        "No, no, no, \u201cTracks of My Tears\u201d and what else? What are some more? What\u2019s one more?",
        "I don\u2019t think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you\u2019re just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music",
        "Oh my God, Ryan! That\u2019s perfect! You have to go!",
        "250 dollars is nothing to the world\u2019s biggest Smokey Robinson fan.",
        "Tears of a clown!",
        "Dwight, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to hurt anybody.",
        "Oh, great! That sounds good!",
        "Sounds like you\u2019re doing alright.",
        "Oh my god!",
        "Whoa!",
        "Are you\u2013 Twice! For real?",
        "Life is Downton Abbey.",
        "Hm-hmm.",
        "Or you proved that he thinks you\u2019re gay.",
        "Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!",
        "Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i\u2019m Sorry Oscar.",
        "Absolutely, it\u2019s awesome\u2013",
        "Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!",
        "What do you feed her?",
        "Does she smell?",
        "Oh, it was this summer \u2013",
        "Um, I am a little busy.",
        "Yeah, I can make you a list.",
        "Why don\u2019t I help you now?",
        "Okay.",
        "So\u2026what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?",
        "Hey.",
        "I stole Nellie\u2019s phone.",
        "What do you want from me?",
        "Sounds like it.",
        "Okay, that\u2019s enough.",
        "No, no, no!",
        "Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They\u2019re all deleted.",
        "Ah. Ahh.",
        "Hey.",
        "Um\u2026 yes. Definitely. With your hair \u2013",
        "Certainly. Um\u2026 you dropped your cell phone.",
        "Yep.",
        "No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.",
        "No, I will not.",
        "Well \u2013",
        "But sometimes he talks about flesh\u2026 and bacchanals.",
        "No\u2026 don\u2019t. Just put it out of your mind.",
        "I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.",
        "Family picture!",
        "What? Honey, we talked about this.",
        "Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.",
        "No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?",
        "We decided that there\u2019s no way Dwight would harm a child.",
        "No, no.",
        "But it\u2019s free. And we\u2019ll keep our eye on them.",
        "Yes!",
        "And we\u2019ll make sure Dwight doesn\u2019t do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, great. Thank you.",
        "Okay.",
        "You ready?",
        "There we go.",
        "I\u2019ll just stand here?",
        "See? That wasn\u2019t so hard.",
        "You hit her?",
        "Oh, Andy.",
        "But have you ever actually seen him yourself?",
        "David, what are you doing here?",
        "For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.",
        "Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.",
        "Yes, Jim's friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.",
        "And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.",
        "He said if it takes off he's gonna buy us a new car.",
        "And that was our summer.",
        "Don't you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.",
        "Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don't think anything's gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there's just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.",
        "Dwight!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "I will?",
        "Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.",
        "No.",
        "Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.",
        "Exactly the way it is.",
        "Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.",
        "Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis.",
        "You ready?",
        "Kay.",
        "The building's custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we're living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.",
        "Well, it doesn't spin. We'll just move the wheel one notch each morning and\u00e2\u20ac  you see what chore you get that day.",
        "No, I'm familiar with spinning. It's just that wouldn't work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-",
        "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcKay.",
        "Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.",
        "I don't think you guys understand why we're doing this. It's-",
        "I've been through several rounds of development with the team and here's where we stand with the chore wheel.  We've got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it's more fun this way.",
        "The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It's so cute no one seems to mind.",
        "Toilets!",
        "Thanks, mom!",
        "Yeah. I'm afraid he's only gonna have hot dogs.",
        "Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.",
        "Think so.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yes, thank you.",
        "Who's that?",
        "Ha-ha.",
        "No. Roy? No.",
        "We still surprise each other.",
        "You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-",
        "Yes. But, what I didn\u2019t tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn\u2019t go because it was-",
        "In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams.  Do we know everything about each other?",
        "Tell me one thing about you I don\u2019t know.",
        "And you thought you guys were millionaires.",
        "Yes. But there\u2019s, wait, oh, there\u2019s a funny ending to that story. I can\u2019t remember.",
        "Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That\u2019s funny. Shoot, I knew that one.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-",
        "Johnny Depp.",
        "I think maybe there actually is something I don\u2019t know about Jim.",
        "OK. Well, here\u2019s something you don\u2019t know. A couple of weeks ago-",
        "I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn\u2019t tell you because, I don\u2019t know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn\u2019t know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you\u2019d want to know.",
        "Yeah, I would\u2019ve. What about you? Come on, there\u2019s gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven\u2019t had the chance to tell me.",
        "Just tell me.",
        "Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico\u2019s at 7:30.",
        "Jim\u2019s at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.",
        ". Is everything okay?",
        "Great.",
        "Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m leaving you alone for lunch.",
        "You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.",
        "Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!",
        "Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?",
        "What?",
        "Sure.",
        "So he\u2019s not related to Michelle Obama?",

        "You\u2019ve got this Schrute.",
        "Oh, I\u2019ll be the buyer.",
        "Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.",
        "Okay, let\u2019s stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?",
        "Okay, when you\u2019re selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their\u2026 Are you listening now?",
        "Okay, well you have to show us.",
        "Huh.  Uh huh.",
        "A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?",
        "Nellie, why don\u2019t you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you\u2019re listening.",
        "Ten years ago, I didn\u2019t care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I\u2019m like, that poor gimp is somebody\u2019s child.",
        "You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.",
        "Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?",
        "Okay, so, when you\u2019re selling to this woman, just imagine that she\u2019s that nice, reasonable barber.",
        "Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.",
        "Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?",
        "Oh, great. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don\u2019t have it.",
        "Okay, great.",
        "Oh my God. It\u2019s Jan.",
        "Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.",
        "Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?",
        "Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! It\u2019s so great to see you.",
        "What?",
        "Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.",
        "So this was all just a trick. You don\u2019t really have any business to give?",
        "But not to us.",
        "You did good, Dwight. It\u2019s okay. I mean, seriously, Jan\u2019s not normal. Let\u2019s just go. She\u2019s not going to sell to us.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?",
        "Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.",
        "And it is so cute how she signs her name.",
        "Oh, okay. It\u2019s just that\u2019s how Cece does it with the backwards \u2018E\u2019s.",
        "Oh, actually she can.",
        "Of course.",
        "Um\u2026 \u201cA\u201d\u2026 \u201cX\u201d? I don\u2019t \u2014 you got me.",
        "I\u2019m so sorry. I hate this. You\u2019re better.",
        "Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?",
        "Oh, my God.",
        "Okay, you do not have to do this.",
        "Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.",
        "Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.",
        "That\u2019s a license number?",
        "Oh. Why me?",
        "These are my painting clothes.I think I\u2019m gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.",
        "Are you avoiding your phone call?",
        "Last week Jim wasn\u2019t there, and they named the company Athlead.",
        "Tell them your opening line.",
        "I think it\u2019s good. He likes fishing.",
        "I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It\u2019s just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I\u2019m gonna limit myself to one shrub.",
        "Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that\u2026",
        "It\u2019s probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.",
        "I could get us a complaint.",
        "No, I wouldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I\u2019d like to try.",
        "Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I\u2019m calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say\u2026 your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, \u201cHey, kool-aid.\u201d Yeah, your mama\u2019s fat. This is Pam Halpert.",
        "Basically I couldn\u2019t tell, but I think\u2026",
        "I\u2013 I thought they were confused at least\u2026",
        "I did not know that.",
        "I\u2019m so sorry.",
        "If you\u2019re an artist, you have to be okay with the idea that you can\u2019t please everybody all the time.",
        "Shut up, Hide! I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him\u2013 or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I\u2019m okay with that.",
        "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine. it\u2019s a blue shirt.",
        "I\u2019m on it.",
        "We\u2019re the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight\u2019s party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it\u2019s not. Maybe it\u2019s going to be great. And if it\u2019s great\u2026I think we all know what that would mean to us.",
        "Yes! Phyllis!",
        "What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?",
        "The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we\u2019re all going to do Dwight\u2019s Christmas.",
        "Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.",
        "And that is\u2026",
        "That there are no rules.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "What is it?  Don\u2019t touch it.",
        "Oh!",
        "I feel like \u2013Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.",
        "And the fear.",
        "Wow.",
        "Mouse trap.",
        "Oh, really? Already?",
        "Well\u2026this is it.",
        "Shut up. I\u2019m trying to be serious.",
        "I can\u2019t believe this is actually happening.",
        "Okay.  Good luck. You\u2019re gonna be great.",
        "Okay.",
        "Love you.",
        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "For what it\u2019s worth, I liked your party better.",
        "I don\u2019t think anyone thought that.",
        "Well, that didn\u2019t have anything to do with you.",
        "Zero.",
        "Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?",
        "Jim!",
        "Oh\u2013Oh my god!",
        "What happened? Did you miss your bus?",
        "What?",
        "Jim\u2019s been spending a few days a week in Philly and I\u2019m not gonna lie, it\u2019s been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I\u2019m exhausted. But don\u2019t tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he\u2019s doing it all for the family.",
        "Great. Everything\u2019s great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?",
        "Oh, call me later!",
        "Good luck!",
        "Love you.",
        "Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.",
        "He didn\u2019t leave me. He just went part time.  Can you just fill out the form please?",
        "I\u2019m sure she\u2019s just confused. People scratch their heads when they\u2019re confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.",
        "Dwight, relax. It\u2019s just lice. Maybe, possibly.",
        "Stop that!",
        "Alright, let\u2019s give her a break. We don\u2019t know for sure this is Meredith\u2019s fault.",
        "No! How? I\u2019m so clean!",
        "Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.",
        "Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let\u2019s not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I\u2019ll tell her it was me.",
        "Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.",
        "Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?",
        "Oh stop! I am so sorry!",
        "Nothing.",
        "I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, we\u2019ll have a few laughs. There\u2019s a right way to do this.",
        "She\u2019s right, it works. I would imagine.",
        "Oh! Uh, uh I\u2019ll go.",
        "No, no, it\u2019s not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I\u2019m at the store, candy, or\u2026or one of those stylish turbans?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, no everything\u2019s great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.",
        "He\u2019s really making you work for it, huh?",
        "Great. I am killing it over here.  Jim, I gotta go.",
        "Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?",
        "Creed, I\u2019m all done. My turn.",
        "Well, wait.",
        "Hello?",
        "What, no. That can\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026",
        "You guys, I am so sorry! It\u2019s just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that\u2026",
        "Is there a volume knob on that thing?",
        "Meredith, I am so sorry.",
        "I meant to say something earlier. I just\u2026",
        "Hey honey, it\u2019s me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.",
        "I\u2019m just gonna go home. My mom\u2019s been watching the kids all day.",
        "Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.",
        "Meredith, I am so sorry about today.",
        "I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.",
        "Get it, girl!",
        "This one\u2019s for all you ladies out there.",
        "Not yet.",
        "Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?",
        "Ha ha. That\u2019d be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get\u2026 What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn\u2019t I think of this? Andy\u2019s not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I\u2019m expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?",
        "A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything\u2019s in order.",
        "Okay, see you later.",
        "You ready for your interview?",
        "Well, you shouldn\u2019t be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.",
        "Really, you can\u2019t be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he\u2019s basically Gumby with hair.",
        "Good!",
        "I just wanted to see you!",
        "Wow, this place is\u2026 so great. I had no idea \u2013 on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.",
        "Sure, no problem.",
        "That\u2019s sweet that he talks about me.",
        "Well, that\u2019s funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.",
        "They\u2019re the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It\u2019s like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don\u2019t blame Cece.",
        "Say they don\u2019t hire you. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.",
        "Right? Thank you! It\u2019s just Philly. Everyone\u2019s acting like it\u2019s New York or Paris or London.",
        "Not us.",
        "Congratulations.",
        "I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.",
        "No, I\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m really excited for Darryl\u2026 Maybe I\u2019m a little disappointed that we\u2019ll be losing him.",
        "Everybody dance now\u2026",
        "Hey\u2026 What happened here?",
        "\u2026Are the pens here?",
        ": Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?",
        "You don\u2019t remember?",
        "There\u2019s nothing down here.",
        "Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?",
        "Oh, no, Kevin, it\u2019s not a joke. Angela\u2019s husband put me up for a\u2013 um, just never mind.",
        "Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I\u2019m just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let\u2019s be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with \u2014 some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?",
        "Well, I\u2019m heading out to Cece\u2019s dance recital.",
        "Hey, Cece, Daddy\u2019s gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?",
        "Let\u2019s call him.",
        "Hey, Hon, are you close?",
        "What?",
        "Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren\u2019t gonna make it.",
        "Of course.",
        "Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.",
        "I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we\u2019re getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, \u201cBye, Daddy.\u201d",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Sorry.",
        "Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural?  Oh, my God!",
        "Um, I\u2019m sorry. I have to go. My daughter\u2019s a ladybug. I know that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.",
        "Shh! Kids are dancing.",
        "Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.",
        "Anyone want to see the video from Cece\u2019s recital?",
        "All right, you don\u2019t have to.",
        "Okay.",
        "Wait. What?",
        "Excuse me, I have to get back to work.",
        "Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.",
        "Well, it was an important phone call.",
        "I haven\u2019t told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he\u2019s always like, \u201cBeesly!\u201d I love that. Only thing better than getting the job\u2013 \u201cBeesly!\u201d",
        "Night",
        "Night, Creed.",
        "Hey.",
        "So, how\u2019s it going?",
        "I\u2019m so sorry.",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I feel like you\u2019ve already been working insanely hard.",
        "Um, actually, funny story \u2014 I didn\u2019t get it. I shouldn\u2019t have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.",
        "No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.",
        "Yeah, okay, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.",
        "Is there\u2013 um\u2026 you want to ease up a little bit?",
        "I don\u2019t know, Jim \u2014 maybe you should have been there.",
        "You know what? I\u2013 I\u2013 I don\u2019t think you want to start a conversation with me about what\u2019s fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever \u2014",
        "I am\u2013 I am\u2013 I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.",
        "Yep.",
        "Yep. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.",
        "Bye.",
        "What am I doing wrong, Brian?",
        "",
        "It\u2019s getting tougher. I just didn\u2019t know that it was gonna be this hard.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hey Brian, you got a sec?",
        "I feel awful.",
        "Well, thanks for being a good friend.",
        "Yeah, mostly.",
        "Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.",
        "Okay. Thank you.",
        "When are you talking to David Wallace?",
        "Too late. My hopes are up.",
        "It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just a seating arrangement. Doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?",
        "Hey, I\u2019m the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim\u2019s away. I\u2019m in a position where I\u2019m rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong.  Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.",
        "Hide, they\u2019re giving out jobs upstairs. Why don\u2019t you go up and get one?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, cool. Hey Clark.",
        "Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.",
        "Of course.",
        "Okay.",
        "Bye.",
        "I\u2019m good.",
        "Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?",
        "Us.",
        "Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I\u2019ll distract him, you take that.",
        "",
        "No, Dwight!",
        "I\u2019ve really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he\u2019s in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I\u2019m usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don\u2019t know, this time I feel like it\u2019s, um, it\u2019s really coming together\u2026  Oh my god!  Wha? You\u2019ve gotta be kidding me! What it\u2026 are those\u2026 are those butts?  Huh? No way. No way!",
        "Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don\u2019t know everybody\u2019s name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand.  Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want?  Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It\u2019s my choice.",
        "I don\u2019t demand justice often. I\u2019m not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val\u2019s no help. Andy\u2019s gone. Jim\u2019s out. I just feel like I\u2019m on my own here.  I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.",
        "Conference room. Everybody. Now!",
        "Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff\u2026 That\u2019s gonna be revealed once we\u2019re in the conference room for the meeting.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.",
        "Yeah, but this is different.",
        "I don\u2019t think so, but they put paint where I didn\u2019t want paint. So\u2026",
        "Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is\u2026 OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.",
        "Yes. Thank you. Let\u2019s answer that question.",
        "What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn\u2019t just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don\u2019t you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.",
        "Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.",
        "No, no. Come on, guys. Don\u2019t go.",
        "You will?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Great.",

        "We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group.  Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.",
        "See, I feel bad about that.",
        "Tell us who defaced the mural!",
        "All right. You can go. Give him his gum.",
        "Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling.  Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I\u2019ve done anything to offend you. I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.",
        "Well, I didn\u2019t think that butt was funny.",
        "What was that?",
        "Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?",
        "That sucked. He didn\u2019t apologize. There\u2019s no talking to that guy.",
        "We should just take him down.",
        "I\u2019m saying we should go scorched earth on that guy\u2019s face.",
        "Yes!",
        "Yes!",
        "We need an infiltrator.",
        "Clark?",
        "Shh, shh.",
        "Shh. Remember your lines.",
        "Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?",
        "OK. What does he like? What\u2019s important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or\u2026",
        "Yeah, something like that.",
        "Oh, great!  His truck!",
        "OK.  Do you know the plate\u2026 never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?",
        "Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye.  Come on.",
        "I\u2019m done. What are you\u2026 Is that supposed to be my mural?",
        "Aw, Dwight. That\u2019s really sweet.",
        "Oh, no. Um, I, I\u2019m embarrassed. It\u2019s stupid.",
        "Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.",
        "Yeah. I feel better.",
        "I know. You miss Angela, don\u2019t you?",
        "I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It\u2019s gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very\u2026",
        "No, you had no right!",
        "So? You started it!",
        "Whoa.",
        "Well, I\u2019m gonna say something to the producers.",
        "You shouldn\u2019t be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.",
        "Forget about my mural. It\u2019s stupid.",
        "It\u2019s crazy. Brian, I\u2019m so sorry.",
        "Thanks, Brian.",
        "Hey. I feel so lucky we\u2019re in the same city for Valentine\u2019s Day.",
        "Alakazam!",
        "And, poof! He disappears.",
        "These are gross.",
        "Oh, hey, don\u2019t fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.",
        "It\u2019s with Brian and Alyssa.",
        "I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.",
        "That sounds nice.",
        "Sorry we\u2019re late.",
        "Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.",
        "He\u2019s on a no carb thing. Supposedly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, my dad can\u2019t hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.",
        "Where\u2019s Alyssa?",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah.",
        "OK, I can tell you\u2019re mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don\u2019t know, tell me why?",
        "I didn\u2019t tell you about the crying because I didn\u2019t want you to know how upset I was. Because it would\u2019ve stressed you out and you\u2019re always saying how much you don\u2019t want more stress.",
        "It\u2019s not Brian\u2019s fault.",
        "OK.",
        "Oh?",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Yeah.",
        "OK.",
        "Wow. I didn\u2019t know you kept this.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I don\u2019t think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.",
        "Yeah, I do.",
        "He sounds like a wounded animal.",
        "Ok.",
        "Oh that\u2019s mine! Um, I\u2019ll just, I\u2019ll get it out of the way for you.",
        "Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It\u2019s um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is.  I\u2019m sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.",
        "Uh, not on a three month boat trip.",
        "hello!",
        "Hi! Hey, do I look ok?",
        "Ok",
        "What\u2019s that? Is that a-",
        "How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.",
        "Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.",
        "Ha ha.",
        "Bye.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi, Pam, hello.",
        "I\u2019m Pam Halpert.",
        "Oh my god. He\u2019s Michael Scott.",
        "Oh my god.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019ve seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I\u2019ve actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-",
        "Oh, cause it was upside down.",
        "So um-",
        "Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-",
        "Yes.",
        "Two children, yes.",
        "I am not pr-",
        "Pregnant, no.",
        "Wow.",
        "I\u2019m sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.",
        "So, kinda like a receptionist.",
        "Yes.",
        "I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can\u2019t.",
        "hey!",
        "Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-",
        "Eight? Really?",
        "Sure. I mean, it\u2019s Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I\u2019ll see you at eight.",
        "Love you.",
        "Hello?",
        "Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?",
        "Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn\u2019t get the job.",
        "Oh, yeah. I\u2019m more than alright. There\u2019s just nothing to celebrate.",
        "You\u2019re very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.",
        "So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.",
        "Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.",
        "Guess what poster he had on his wall?",
        "MmMm.",
        "MmMm. You\u2019re getting colder.",
        "No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.",
        "I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s interesting right?",
        "He said he can\u2019t help but tear up when he looks at it. It\u2019s like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.",
        "Mmhm.",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "I know. It\u2019s just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know if I want, um, I don\u2019t know if I want this.",
        "Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.",
        "Oh, Dwight. I\u2019m so sorry. Were you guys close?",
        "\u2026 bad.",
        "Todd, you\u2019re just saying insults in the form of an apology.",
        "I think it\u2019s called \u2018Nibbles\u2019.",
        "Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don\u2019t eat the cupcake.",
        "I don\u2019t think we should eat Packers\u2019 cupcakes. We can\u2019t give him the satisfaction.",
        "We can\u2019t let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?",
        "Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?",
        "So, it really is just about the cupcakes.",
        "Kevin, um, let\u2019s think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?",
        "Yes. He was a good spy.",
        "Guys, I\u2019m proud of us. I think we did the right thing.  Hey!",
        "Wait!",
        "No, no. It\u2019s the principle of the thing.",
        "Good morning, Erin.",
        "Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn\u2019t know, it\u2019s OK.",
        "Phyllis!",
        "No!",
        "Oh my god! Is everyone OK?",
        "Wow. He is officially the worst human being.",
        "But, Kevin that\u2019s\u2026",
        "Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she\u2019s been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you don\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s a book about um\u2026",
        "Yeah.",
        "Be careful. I pulled my mom\u2019s dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.",
        "She\u2019s listening to 50 Shades of Grey.",
        "Cici has been calling me \u2018Pamela\u2019. Like four times this week.",
        "I wonder if she\u2019ll start calling you \u2018Jim\u2019.",
        "Um.",
        "You\u2019re- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?",
        "Oh, oh OK.",
        "Um, Ok. Well?",
        "Yeah, sounds good. Ok.",
        "Ok.",
        "Bye.",
        "Uh huh.",
        "It wasn\u2019t so bad.",
        "Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.",
        "Oh my god!",
        "Brian?",
        "Yeah, I guess I could.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hi, um. I\u2019m sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?",
        "Oh my gosh, please, don\u2019t.",
        "Sure, yeah. Yeah.",
        "OK.  Oh wow, you have a nice view.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "Cheers.",
        "So..",
        "Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.",
        "Yeah. It\u2019s kinda crazy.",
        "See all this like old stuff, like um, there\u2019s that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?",
        "Yeah, wasn\u2019t that neat?",
        "Yeah, and there\u2019s this one when we were listening to music and it\u2019s like, it\u2019s like w were in love and we didn\u2019t even know we were in love and it\u2019s\u2026but- Do you think Jim\u2019s changed?",
        "I\u2019m sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-",
        "I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he\u2019s- I just feel like\u2026he\u2019s so into his work right now and\u2026.I don\u2019t know, am I crazy?",
        "Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they\u2019re kinda freaking out.  Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-",
        "You know, stuff people didn\u2019t intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.",
        "How much stuff you got.",
        "Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?",
        "So we basically had no privacy for ten years.",
        "Um\u2026yeah, I gotta, I gotta go.",
        "No I think you explained it.",
        "I hope you got sound on everything. I\u2019d love a DVD of that.",
        "Well, we won\u2019t be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.",
        "I wish.",
        "Oh, nothing that exciting.",
        "Hmm.",
        "You know, Jim\u2019s kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.",
        "I mean, we\u2019ve having issues. It can\u2019t hurt to talk about them, right?",
        "He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, heshouldn\u2019tbe rewarded for that.",
        "I feel like he\u2019s always making these decisions for the family, and then I\u2019m left playing catch-up.",
        "I\u2019m sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don\u2019t want him to do it anymore, and I don\u2019t want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.",
        "I didn\u2019t see you! You should have yelled \u201cCrossing!\u201d",
        "Ok, so is that my spot?",
        "Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.",
        "So, we had couple\u2019s therapy.",
        "And we have homework.",
        "And we\u2019re also supposed to speak our truths.",
        "Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn\u2019t have had this opportunity for couple\u2019s therapy.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.",
        "Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  There\u2019s a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.",
        "Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.",
        "I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.",
        "Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-",
        "Uh, to speak my truth, I\u2019d appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation.  I appreciate the sacrifice.",
        "Really? I\u2019ve been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That\u2019s really your truth?",
        "We\u2019re not high.",
        "I wish we\u2019d started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so\u2026 blocked up.",
        "Ok.",
        "Jim!",
        "Alright, have a good trip.",
        "Bye.",
        "I love you.",
        "It\u2019s great.",
        "The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.",
        "Nice morning, too.",
        "Wow.",
        "it\u2019s okay. You can sit in the annex.",
        "I\u2019ll come visit you.",
        "Oh, Andy.",
        "Yes. Yeah.",
        "Oh, boy. Um\u2014",
        "I could give you some beginner stickies?",
        "Here you go.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It\u2019s all yours.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hi.",
        "Um, I have a question.",
        "Oh, I had a question.",
        "I did!",
        "Super important.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right. I did not come back here just to see you.",
        "I don\u2019t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I\u2019m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it\u2019s like a double date.",
        "Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.",
        "Oh, well, Thursday\u2019s tough, because of\u2014",
        "They are.",
        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "Congratulations, Dwight.",
        "It\u2019s nice to have you back.",
        "Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.",
        "Is that them again?",
        "Maybe you should call back?",
        "When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he\u2019s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he\u2019s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.",
        "Question.",
        "We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they\u2019re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, \u201cNice jugs\u201d?",
        "What are you so excited about?",
        "What are you up to?",
        "Nice.",
        "Theme song from Saved by the Bell.",
        "Darryl, hey.",
        "Cool, are you coming back to say hi?",
        "Aha. How\u2019s Athlead?",
        "Wow.",
        "He says he doesn\u2019t want to.",
        "Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.",
        "That\u2019s what he says.",
        "Hey.",
        "Are you happy?",
        "No, I know that you\u2019re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.",
        "And that was fun. But what about a year from now?",
        "What about five years from now?",
        "Because I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back, baby, but I\u2019m just\u2014I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you\u2019re giving up so much.",
        "Okay.",
        "I kind of forced you to do it.",
        "Yes, I did.",
        "I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019re gonna resent me and I\u2019m afraid that\u2014",
        "This is not enough for you and I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m not enough for you.",
        "He does have a gift.",
        "What is this?",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What\u2019s that?",
        "Thank you.",
        "What? Dwight, you can\u2019t do that.",
        "Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone\u2019s ever been fired, Toby\u2019s blocked it, so\u2026",
        "Angela, are you ready for the wedding?",
        "I think she looks good. Now that she\u2019s wearing sports bras, we don\u2019t see her boobs as much.",
        "Darryl! Andy!",
        "We\u2019re fine. Yeah.  And I\u2019m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn\u2019t you be?",
        "Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How\u2019s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.",
        "Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.",
        "Oh, boy.",
        "Wait, wait. What?",
        "Uh, that seems inappropriate.",
        "Whoo-hoo\u2026go, Meredith\u2019s stripper son.",
        "No, no, I\u2019m fine.",
        "Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m working on something.",
        "I\u2019m sorry. Is there a question?",
        "Oh, um, well, you know, I\u2026 I just\u2026 I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you\u2019d been filmed for nine years of your life, there\u2019d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.",
        "Listen, um\u2026 I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn\u2019t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he\u2019s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it\u2019s better than a fairy tale. It\u2019s like a long book that you never want to end.  And you\u2019re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.",
        "Yeah, like Harry Potter.",
        "Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.",
        "Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.",
        "Oh, my gosh, it\u2019s choreographed!",
        "He just so happy to have a family plan.",
        "Is it me? Is it Nellie?",
        "I need to get out of this dress.",
        "Why are you still here?",
        "Okay, Okay. Um\u2026 so\u2026 this past year has been really great, and you\u2019ve been great and I just\u2026 I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn\u2019t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture\u2026 and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.",

        "Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper\u2026,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I\u2019ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim.  And go ahead!",
        "Everyone, Let\u2019s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just\u2026I kind of meant just everybody from the office.",
        "Okay.",
        "Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn\u2019t work here anymore.",
        "I didn\u2019t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It\u2019s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It\u2019d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I\u2019m a tragic person. I\u2019m really happy now. But\u2026it would just\u2026just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself \u201cbe strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn\u2019t that long.\u201d",
        "What about the honeymoon?",

        "Thanks Dwight.",
        "I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all\u2026I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There\u2019s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn\u2019t that kind of the point?"

        "I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he\u2019s eye candy. It\u2019s OK, Bob\u2026 Vance knows he\u2019s on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.",
        "Is there any mustard?",
        "The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss.",
        "What are you gonna do?",
        "Dwight is our new boss.",
        "I think it\u2019s gonna be Michael.",
        "No, but he wasn\u2019t qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.",
        "Michael, what happened?",
        "You shot Dwight?",
        "Does it hurt terribly?",
        "I\u2019m a Lutheran and Bob\u2019s a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.",
        "Oh, it\u2019s coming.",
        "That\u2019s despicable.",
        "That\u2019s\u2026",
        "Go get him Bobby!",
        "Sic him!",
        "Sic him!",
        "You guys are together?",
        "Did you plan it?",
        "Michael\u2026",
        "Sorry, I didn\u2019t know you guys were in here.",
        "I couldn\u2019t see your hands.  Hey Pam, by the way, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can\u2019t base who gets new clients on who you\u2019re sleeping with that week, OK?",
        "OK.",
        "Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?",
        "Did you even try?",
        "I can\u2019t see half of the things.",
        "Stanley, you\u2019re dancing!",
        "Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this.  So we\u2019re gonna try out some new things today.",
        "So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?",
        "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.",
        "I want to understand what you\u2019re saying but it\u2019s difficult for me when you use that tone.",
        "Yes.",
        "You can pick one of these things.  It\u2019s unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.",
        "",
        "That seemed to shut her up.",
        "Yeah, that sounds right.",
        "He\u2019s always been terrible with money.",
        "Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.",
        "Dancing babies!",
        "Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She\u2019s doing a book signing right now.",
        "Okay.",
        "Bye everyone.",
        "Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton\u2019s book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn\u2019t supposed to take no for an answer.",
        "So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.",
        "No.",
        "Popcorn.",
        "Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.",
        "Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once.",
        "Michael wasn\u2019t invited on Ryan\u2019s camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn\u2019t go. He wasn\u2019t invited.",
        "Oh!",
        "Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.",
        "Do you have any idea what time we\u2019ll get out of here?",
        "Call us when you get there so we know you\u2019re OK.",
        "Michael?",
        "I have a friend who\u2019s single.",
        "Sandy. She\u2019s gorgeous and she\u2019s got a feisty personality, too.",
        "Umm, no, she\u2019s a professional softball player.",
        "Umm I don\u2019t know Michael.",
        "What are you asking?",
        "No, alright no, she can\u2019t fit in a row boat.",
        "Well, I\u2019m setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.",
        "Did the police solve the problem with the\u2026",
        "Elliot.",
        "Jim was supposed to collect it.",
        "I don\u2019t understand.  Which one is that?",
        "Oh.",
        "We\u2013 we\u2013",
        "Well\u2013",
        "When I was a little girl\u2026",
        "We-we found some wet cement in the park\u2026",
        "In our neighborhood\u2026",
        "What did we write?",
        "That\u2019s the dumbest thing I ever heard.",
        "I like your frames.",
        "Oh, well, I\u2019m already married.  Boys don\u2019t make passes at girls who wear glasses.",
        "I mean, Michael\u2019s gone, can\u2019t we just go?",
        "What consequences?",
        "Yes.",
        "Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?",
        "That\u2019s right. Yeah.",
        "They make you feel lighter\u2026",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can\u2019t\u2026",
        "Why would you do that?",
        "Really?",
        "Hello Angela.",
        "Can I get a list of your vendors?",
        "Why would you do that?",
        "Sorry.",
        "Kevin, take your shoes off first!",
        "Sorry, Michael, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re real.",
        "Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce.  Okay.",
        "Party planning\u2019s a real high. Like a runner\u2019s high.",
        "Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you\u2019re in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have sworn, I\u2019m so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time.   What?  Sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have said \u2018what\u2019 like that, it was really rude.",
        "Jim, I am so fed.",
        "I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not used to the stress.",
        "When I was growing up, my mom said, \u201cthe sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d  I could do anything.  Be a teacher\u2019s aide, nurse\u2019s assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I\u2019m not so sure.",
        "And if the food stations are here and here\u2026 no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?",
        "Mmm, no Bob, I don\u2019t know.",
        "It\u2019s times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She\u2019d show me what to do.  That\u2019s stupid; she\u2019s not here.   She\u2019s at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.",
        "Angela, you\u2019ll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it\u2019s the generic one. It\u2019s Stanley\u2019s favorite.",
        "Yes, I\u2019ve replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee.  I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.",
        "It\u2019s going well.",
        "We lost weight today. I think it\u2019s OK to reward ourselves once in a while.",
        "Stanley, Michael\u2019s not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.",
        "You said fruit, Michael.",
        "Cake.",
        "Yes you were.",
        "Split the commission?",
        "Are you insane?!",
        "There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.",
        "You left me in a bad part of town!",
        "Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.",
        "Why should I have to thank him?",
        "I like her purple dress.",
        "I wonder what people like about me? \u2026 Probably my jugs.",
        "I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.",
        "Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.",
        "I don\u2019t care what she\u2019s doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.",
        "During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he\u2019d been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn\u2019t know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.",
        "Mmm\u2026 sometimes her stockings have a run in them.",
        "One time I said good morning to her, and she didn\u2019t say it back.",
        "No.",
        "That can\u2019t be right.",
        "Hey, I\u2019m collecting for the baby shower.",
        "I know, Kevin.",
        "Look at it as if you\u2019re paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.",
        "I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I\u2019m no longer under Angela\u2019s heel, and her little grape head is under mine.",
        "Sorry.",
        "What are you making?",
        "You\u2019re making a knife with a knife?",
        "You want to talk about it?",
        "You know I know.  You know they know.",
        "Hi.",
        "It\u2019s nice to learn new things.",
        "Okay.",
        "What don\u2019t you get?",
        "Angela\u2019s not really a risk taker. And Andy\u2019s not really a risk.",
        "No, it\u2019s lettuce.",
        "Where are we going?",
        "Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.",
        "It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.",
        "I think it\u2019s a fun idea.",
        "We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.",
        "Move on, Michael.",
        "It\u2019s the only gavel I could find.",
        "Oh dear.",
        "Why couldn\u2019t have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?",
        "Now you move on.",
        "Well Dwight, I don\u2019t think you do. I think you\u2019ve got your answer.",
        "Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.",
        "I have my hug.",
        "Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?",
        "Mm. I like your shoes.",
        "Sure.",
        "I\u2019m sitting right here Dwight.",
        "I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we\u2019re in the same building.",
        "Hey, I did good too!",
        "It\u2019s good!",
        "We\u2019re laughing at this cartoon!",
        "Haven\u2019t you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.",
        "On more week.",
        "Dwight, stop it.",
        "Jim, don\u2019t listen to Andy.  I think it\u2019s so romantic.",
        "Where\u2019s your place?",
        "Ohhh\u2026",
        "Hello.",
        "Know what?",
        "I\u2019m sorry.  It\u2019s the largest one I have.",
        "This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is \u201cNights in Morocco\u201d.  This isn\u2019t your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she\u2019s from Morocco, in which case it\u2019s very accurate.",
        "Yes.",
        "Angela. You\u2019re going to move this for the party right? It\u2019s not on theme.",
        "Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.",
        "I need you to get rid of the tree.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won\u2019t tell everyone that she\u2019s cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.",
        "It looks like we\u2019re going to be here for awhile, so why don\u2019t you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.",
        "And napkins\u2026 fanned.",
        "I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate.  I don\u2019t think they\u2019re appropriate anymore.",
        "Oh, sorry, it\u2019s your job.",
        "You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren\u2019t you wearing the hairnet?",
        "Ok\u2026 nice.",
        "That\u2019s a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan.",
        "I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.",
        "I didn\u2019t ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Okay.  Angela\u2019s having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby\u2019s going away party.",
        "Wow, thirteen!",
        "Why isn\u2019t Dwight turning around?",
        "Andy\u2019s running over Dwight with his car.",
        "Dwight, get out of here!",
        "You\u2019ve got no taste Stanley Hudson.",
        "Hillary Swank.",
        "She\u2019s not hot.",
        "What\u2013",
        "Oh! I forgot my purse.",
        "What in the name of God is going on?!",
        "That\u2019s not a good idea, Michael.",
        "He needs to rest.",
        "We bury him?",
        "It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.",
        "Let me get you some water.",
        "Hey, this is your apology letter.",
        "I hope he\u2019s ok, I feel bad.",
        "Oh, ok.",
        "You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.",
        "She\u2019s out of your league Andy.",
        "Sexually?",
        "There\u2019s always a theme.",
        "Hey, why don\u2019t you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We\u2019ll take all afternoon.  Michael is terrified of bob.",
        "It is so nice to go out with another couple.",
        "I know",
        "He\u2019s talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.",
        "Okay. Now everyone here who\u2019s bowled under 70 raise their hand.",
        "Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand.",
        "Yes I do.",
        "Bowling.",
        "Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.",
        "Yeah, thank you.",
        "Damn.",
        "Um, let\u2019s see\u2026 it\u2019s fine.",
        "Andy He\u2019s gone.",
        "You don\u2019t have to kiss his ass anymore.",
        "I never see him drink. I never see him eat.",
        "No, I swallowed a crown.",
        "It\u2019s really cute.",
        "What\u2019s wrong with you?",
        "I think you look nice.",
        "You sound worried.",
        "Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Maybe, and I don\u2019t know, if you had just returned Michael\u2019s call none of us would\u2019ve lost clients.",
        "You mean the clients you stole from us.",
        "It sure looked good on the mannequin.",
        "Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.",
        "Isn\u2019t that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn\u2019t have enough time for them?",
        "Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.",
        "You don\u2019t take my clients away and give them to a secretary.   No offense, Jim.  I think she\u2019s very pretty.",
        "Those sound too harsh.",
        "A restaurant.",
        "Ryan, hand the phone over.",
        "Me.",
        "Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.",
        "Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.",
        "Michael, just give us our clients back.  That\u2019s all we care about.",
        "Michael, we have a lot of work to do.",
        "Work.",
        "It\u2019s a combo dance house coffee bar.",
        "Aw, what the hell?  Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?",
        "Oh, I\u2019ll just duck my head in.",
        "Tell him I\u2019m going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hey. I like.",
        "Oh! Mother ******!",
        "Back!",
        "",
        "Wow! Sorry!",
        "It\u2019s my back.",
        "Call a doctor.",
        "No. Call Bob.",
        "What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.",
        "Dwight! Dwight!",
        "I do.",
        "That feels good, Dwight.",
        "An hour? I can\u2019t stay here an hour.",
        "But the rattler\u2019s so scary.",
        "I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary.",
        "When I say it out loud it\u2019s so silly.",
        "Wanna dance, Dwight?",
        "I was all-county my junior and senior years.",
        "The girls school?",
        "We\u2019ve been out here for a while. I don\u2019t need this.",
        "Oh, Lord in heaven.",
        "Ow, my ankle!",
        "I\u2026 twisted it.",
        "They\u2019re not getting married. It\u2019s just talk.",
        "There\u2019s nothing to know, it\u2019s just gossip.",
        "Teri\u2019s out of town, Michael.",
        "Teri, Stanley\u2019s wife. She\u2019s at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.",
        "How far along is Pam?",
        "We have a right to know.",
        "Congratulations!",
        "Again with the cousin.",
        "What\u2019s happening to you Michael?",
        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?",
        "Perfect. I hate registries.",
        "My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn\u2019t tell you, but you\u2019ll still be suprised when you see it. You\u2019re not registered for a birdhouse, are you?",
        "Good. Good.",
        "This isn\u2019t a game, you know? It\u2019s our livelihood!",
        "Not according to the beans.",
        "It\u2019s not so much that I might not get a raise. It\u2019s just demeaning!",
        "Yeah, I would, too.",
        "I say no.",
        "Michael!",
        "Come on! This isn\u2019t fair!",
        "Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!",
        "Now this is getting ridiculous.",
        "That\u2019s funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it.",
        "I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn\u2019t be a good wife.",
        "So he won\u2019t get caught!",
        "Disgusting\u2026",
        "Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.",
        "Wow. Sounds scary.",
        "Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?",
        "And when you fell in, did you flounder?",
        "Michael, you make fun of us every day.",
        "So now you\u2019re comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?",
        "Michael. You know, when you think about it, it\u2019s not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?",
        "We\u2019re not mocking, we\u2019re watching.",
        "Well, we\u2019ll deal with it as it comes.",
        "Yes. Put the DVD in.",

        "You know, I think I\u2019m supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?   I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Michael, I was doing so well.",
        "Well, I guess that\u2019s not-",
        "Lose the twirl.",
        "Yeah, good. Don\u2019t do it.",
        "Bob took me to Capello\u2019s. We got a little tipsy.",
        "Oh, it\u2019s ok. Michael doesn\u2019t really care about these things.",
        "It\u2019s not like you can fire people or anything.",
        "Ryan.",
        "Sorry. Plastered.",
        "What\u2019s \u201cScott\u2019s Tots?\u201d",
        "Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.",
        "That\u2019s fair.",
        "How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?",
        "Ooh.",
        "You didn\u2019t decorate it?",
        "Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It\u2019s me, Santa Claus!",
        "Yeah!",
        "I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it.  It\u2019s been a long journey\u2026 but  I\u2019m Santa Claus!",
        "It\u2019s going to be a very jolly time if you\u2019ve been good!",
        "Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well?",
        "The only Santa.",
        "You promised me this. Don\u2019t make me get Bob involved!",
        "Never mind, I shouldn\u2019t have said that.",
        "How do you know it\u2019s a gun?",
        "In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let\u2019s put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle\u2019s eye! Let the party begin!",
        "All right sweetie, I\u2019ll tell her its Michael.",
        "This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!",
        "Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You\u2019ve been very good this year \u2013",
        "And this brings us to you, little one.",
        "It\u2019s a secret.",
        "Hi Michael.  Mm. \u2018kay.",
        "What?",
        "An Xbox it is. Because I\u2019ve decided you\u2019re a good boy.",
        "No Bob, we worked it out.",
        "I\u2019m sorry,",
        "I\u2019m really sorry. It was earlier today.",
        "Hi sweetie.",
        "I\u2019m good baby.",
        "Michael, this isn\u2019t a toast. You\u2019re just thinking out loud.",
        "I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I\u2019m on.",
        "No.",
        "I did.",
        "You don\u2019t even like us as friends?",
        "I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.",
        "No, it\u2019s 4:35.",
        "Good luck!",
        "This is ridiculous.  We just can\u2019t wait here.",
        "But you don\u2019t know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.",
        "I have an ice cream cake in the car.",
        "Hey!",
        "But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?",
        "Honey, if I don\u2019t have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don\u2019t have time to walk over to your desk.",
        "Finally, Michael. Hand \u2019em over, numbnuts.  But seriously. It\u2019s your job to give us those leads.",
        "What are you \u2013",
        "What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?",
        "Are you gonna give me the leads or not?",
        "What are these for?",
        "Michael, why would we all go to the dump?",
        "I think you\u2019re remembering that wrong?",
        "I don\u2019t know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company\u2019s changed, and if they don\u2019t like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.",
        "What\u2019s the least we can do to make this okay?",
        "I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.",
        "Oh, if they don\u2019t have an iPod by now they really don\u2019t want one.",
        "Okay, fine. Cash it is.",
        "So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you \u2013",
        "Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So\u2026",
        "Our treats, Stanley, they\u2019ve accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.",
        "Yuck. I\u2019m not going to sit on that disgusting seat.",
        "Say \u201cMe eat cookie.\u201d",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I don\u2019t get it.",
        "You don\u2019t know that. Some people can\u2019t help oozing sexuality.",
        "She just crossed her arms together\u2026 that\u2019s bad.",
        "Michael, you know, it\u2019s easy to get fooled. Bob\u2019s warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It\u2026 it\u2019s mostly harmless. Usually I don\u2019t let it go too far.",
        "Oh, Michael.",
        "I don\u2019t think he\u2019d do that.",
        "Oh Michael.",
        "Hey!",
        "Was there a fistfight?",
        "And it didn\u2019t change your mind.",
        "Michael, that\u2019s awful.",
        "Yes.",
        "For your signature.",
        "Awww, it\u2019s kissing its mommy!",
        "Put your hand up, Norma Rae.",
        "Look, he\u2019s been complaining about this for a while, it\u2019s not crazy.",
        "I don\u2019t know, is it Shadow or Garth, it\u2019s something weird, I\u2026",
        "You deserve it.",
        "Dwight!",
        "Luke? Luke!",
        "Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn\u2019t get \u2019em.",
        "Yeah, but it\u2019s like you\u2019re saying we should bother Luke.",
        "Hey, why can\u2019t we bother Luke? He deserves it.",
        "Well, take a look. It\u2019s all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.",
        "Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.",
        "The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?",
        "I\u2019m glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he\u2019s stupid.",
        "Go get \u2019em Dwight.",
        "It\u2019s nice, like Up.",
        "Found him!",
        "Your show was really great, Andy.",
        "Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.",
        "Yeah, I got stung up my dress.",
        "God! Wow!",
        "That\u2019s no pimple Michael.",
        "Oh! When you got your new phone, that\u2019s when you asked for everyone\u2019s attention.",
        "The ability to express love physically. It\u2019s a magical thing.",
        "What? Is Dan okay?",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh, that\u2019s great news for your friend.",
        "You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.",
        "I could try to seduce him.",
        "Uh\u2026",
        "This is weird.",
        "It\u2019s not gonna get better; he\u2019s gonna steal all of our clients.",
        "I don\u2019t know, they\u2019re both handsome.",
        "I think he-",
        "Oh.",
        "What should we ask?",
        "An asset!",
        "Who takes a kid to Mexico?",
        "Church isn\u2019t a party, Michael.",
        "Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?",
        "Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?",
        "Here\u2019s her carrier, but no Cece.",
        "Who\u2019s that?",
        "Who\u2019s that?",
        "Which one\u2019s Glee?",
        "You know your perfumes!",
        "Are you alright?",
        "I know. I thought you two were nice together.",
        "Made love? I don\u2019t know.",
        "I\u2019ll see what I can find out.",
        "Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?",
        "And I imagine things are starting to heat up?",
        "Of course you don\u2019t wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn\u2019t even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.",
        "Magical\u2026",
        "You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.",
        "What do we do? How do we stop this?",
        "Yeah, Dwight\u2019s right we should drop a bomb.",
        "Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.",
        "I am jumping.",
        "Yes, I\u2019m jumping.",
        "Yeah, I don\u2019t even have a laptop.",
        "Oh God.",
        "Oh, don\u2019t be such a baby.",
        "What\u2019s the case, Toby?",
        "So is it an open relationship?",
        "Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.",
        "So you went homemade this year.",
        "Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don\u2019t think we can help you out.",
        "Are you good at homemade?",
        "Yeah\u2026",
        "Well, I don\u2019t think Erin seems to like you.",
        "I think it\u2019s good.",
        "I know Sue. She\u2019s not that great. And you know her husband\u2019s in a wheelchair, right?",
        "I\u2019ll talk to her, Michael.",
        "Why wouldn\u2019t she?",
        "Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?",
        "Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.",
        "No.",
        "So, I\u2019ve just gotta know. What\u2019s going on with you and AJ?",
        "You didn\u2019t break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?",
        "A lot of mines in Scranton.",
        "I\u2019m out too.",
        "Hmm?",
        "Wow.",
        "C.C",
        "I\u2019m clicking!",
        "I am clicking.",
        "Well, if you think it\u2019s so easy, Gabe, why don\u2019t you try it?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, who wrote it?",
        "Maybe that\u2019s not the best one. Keep reading.",
        "No, that\u2019s not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.",
        "Yeah, there you go.",
        "Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won\u2019t do it, but they will if you make a scene.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah, and it\u2019s not just the kissing. It\u2019s the flirtatious whispering.",
        "If you\u2019re just handing them out, I want one too.",
        "Yeah mostly.",
        "It didn\u2019t go down so easy but she\u2019s made some friends and it\u2019s already better than it was.",
        "Uh I don\u2019t know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says \u2018I cant take care of myself anymore\u2019 its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you\u2019re interested.",
        "Yeah, real cool. Real power move.",
        "Mmm, whatcha got?",
        "I love their breadsticks!",
        "I have diabetes too. You don\u2019t see me making a big deal about it.",
        "How about cupcakes?",
        "The three of us have all been chairmen before.",
        "Yeah that was a surprise\u2026",
        "Please Michael.",
        "I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.",
        "Look Michael, it\u2019s a going away present so your hands won\u2019t get cold.",
        "It\u2019s almost done, but you can\u2019t get them wet, and they can\u2019t be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.",
        "It\u2019s cute.",
        "What does that even mean?",
        "Do you believe that?!",
        "Hmm, let\u2019s hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes.",
        "As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.",
        "Yeah, cupcakes. That\u2019s what I said.",
        "You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?",
        "No.  I\u2019m on a sale!",
        "Okay\u2026",
        "They\u2019re almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-",
        "Oh no, they\u2019re still not done.",
        "Here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "I\u2019m not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren\u2019t.",
        "That\u2019s true.",
        "He means the ice pack.",
        "You could put your cell phone in it instead.",
        "How\u2019s your hearing?",
        "Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Did you have a nice drive in?",
        "Oh, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll let us know when they get the results.",
        "It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.",
        "But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky\u2019s had come out.",
        "Mm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.",
        "Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?",
        "Bestiality. Yeah.",
        "If my daughter were asking me\u2026",
        "I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,\u2026 go get them.",
        "I don\u2019t think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.",
        "You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.",
        "Is it true that you\u2019re making Dwight the manager?",
        "He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.",
        "Yeah.  Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point.",
        "No, we\u2019re not related. I got the call. But\u2026 I\u2019ll tell her some other day.",
        "It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?",
        "Then what was this all about?",
        "Yeah, it can\u2019t be nothing.",
        "Ahhh!",
        "Yeah. Yeah. Oh.",
        "Thanks guys.",
        "C\u2019mon, just say you saw the list by accident.",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?",
        "Completely.",
        "Well, what about the other guys.",
        "Whew, well. I guess that\u2019s that.",
        "Good night, Andy.",
        "I\u2019ll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.",
        "Ooh, why is it shaped like that?",
        "Andy, don\u2019t make us sell this stupid thing.",
        "Wait\u2026.they\u2019re terrified?",
        "Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can\u2019t just press a magic button.",
        "You don\u2019t have to thank us for coming in, it\u2019s our job.",
        "Ask for Donald, Karen\u2019s bananas.",
        "What else you got?",
        "Just wear one of your bowties.",
        "That\u2019s still a lot of money!",
        "Yeah.",
        "What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.",
        "Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can\u2019t lose this client.",
        "No..we don\u2019t",
        "Yeah, I lost my client.",
        "The first thing I\u2019d buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It\u2019s embarrassing.",
        "Yeah, what\u2019s the reason?",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s just a picnic.",
        "Why didn\u2019t you just say this was to impress Robert California?",
        "Who?",
        "Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.",
        "Wait, they have food there?",
        "I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.",
        "Is she Asian?",
        "Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend\u2019s from the forest?",
        "Hmm.",
        "Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.",
        "We did our best.",
        "Yeah you have this sexy glow.",
        "No we\u2019re not.",
        "Or should I have corndogs. I mean-",
        "Well, this could be fun. I-",
        "I\u2019m in too.",
        "Ooh. Isn\u2019t that the one where the guy becomes limitless?",
        "Yeah, sign says \u201cBegin tour here.\u201d",
        "I don\u2019t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.",
        "Oh, I like Olive Garden.",
        "Open the door, Jim.",
        "Are you sure? Yeah, it\u2019s locked.",
        "Ow! Ee! I sat on my sandwich.",
        "I don\u2019t get it.",
        "We have a gym at home. It\u2019s called the bedroom.",
        "Aw\u2026 He\u2019s so tiny. Is he in a ladle?",
        "Is that ladle stainless or\u2026",
        "One, two three!",
        "You know, don\u2019t listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.",
        "Is that Cici?",
        "That\u2019s awful.",
        "Dwight?",
        "He should pay.",
        "What?",
        "Backups.",
        "Oh I know you think that, because that\u2019s where the Olympics were held.",
        "Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being silly.",
        "Then another woman will get it. We can\u2019t allow that. We have to destroy it.",
        "Robert\u2019s house is, well\u2026.I don\u2019t mean to sound offensive, but it\u2019s like where a basketball player would live.",
        "How was jury duty?",
        "Did you send him to the slammer?",
        "Oh, I\u2019d love to but, um-",
        "Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Why?",
        "I\u2019m sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?",
        "Cookies?",
        "Oh.",
        "No, just go home.",
        "Just go.",
        "Mmm-hmm. Moneybags. Must be nice.",
        "Are you glad to be back?",
        "I have a new swimsuit I need to break in\u2026.",
        "Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.",
        "If I wanted Jamaican food I\u2019d just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.",
        "Ooh, gosh, the moon one\u2019s damning. Yeah, sorry.",
        "No way.",
        "Do you have a black eye?",
        "Look, I don\u2019t feel safe. I think we should call the police.",
        "If Dwight\u2019s not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh.",
        "Make them kiss each other.",
        "What are you doing?",

Don\u2019t be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don\u2019t ever think there is. There is only\u2026 sex. Everything\u2026 is sex. You understand that what I\u2019m telling you is a universal truth,\u2026 Toby.",

        "That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object\u2026 whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we\u2019ve had already, you won\u2019t be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?",
        "Yes. You do.",
        "Ohh, unfortunately, yes.",
        "That business can\u2019t attract anyone. It\u2019s awful up there. Those people seem like they\u2019re in prison, waiting out life sentences in a\u2026 dying industry.",

        "And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It\u2019s a waste of your time. That\u2019s how every day\u2019s begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.",

        "Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don\u2019t you think? Well, I doodle too, but I\u2019m not an artist. So I draw words and lists.",
        "Might as well have been sketching a cube.",

        "Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?",
        "Sesame street.",
        "Elmo, god\u2019s sake, it\u2019s the Elmo era.",
        "Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn\u2019t you agree.",

        "No.",
        "I don\u2019t- I don\u2019t wanna say-",
        "No, no.",

        "Probably shouldn\u2019t have said that.",
        "I never said that.",
        "Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I\u2019ll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you\u2019re a winner. If I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.",
        "I\u2019m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don\u2019t use ballpoint pens.",
        "I did not know about the sales figures.",
        "Are we done?",
        "You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?",
        "And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.",

        "I can expense it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hello, Andy.  Excellent tie.",
        "I\u2019d love some coffee.",
        "I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.",
        "Andy, do you know why I chose you?",
        "Vanilla? No no no no.  You\u2019ll never guess in a million billion years you\u2019ll never guess.",
        "Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?",
        "Oh! Thank you. Uh\u2026.",
        "You can just put it down.",
        "That is very cold.",
        "Why would I\u2026..?",
        "You like her.",
        "She likes you.",
        "I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve lost my interest.",
        "If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?",
        "Ah\u2026",
        "Oh, you\u2019d go someplace else.  That\u2019s not it, that\u2019s not the answer.",
        "It\u2019s a wrong answer.",
        "Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it\u2019s birth.  Those superstores are terrified of us.  Anybody know why?",
        "Let me tell you how I buy something these days.  I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price.  Or I don\u2019t know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me.  The era of personal service is back. You are back.  You\u2019ll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them \u201cyou are welcome.\u201d  Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people.  Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen.  Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.",
        "Double.",
        "I\u2019m not kidding.",
        "Double.",
        "Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he\u2019s all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.",
        "There\u2019s something about an underdog that really inspires\u2026the unexceptional.",
        "Andrew, I\u2019ve picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade.",
        "Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade.",
        "You don\u2019t want to hear the other one. You love marmalade.",
        "It\u2019s a basil plant.",
        "I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she\u2019s very interested.",
        "Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright.",
        "Hello Andy.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yes, hello, nice to meet you.",
        "Andy, where shall I put your basil plant?",
        "No, I\u2019m certain you said basil.",
        "I\u2019ll say a few words if that\u2019s alright with you, Andy.",
        "You people say I led you, but it wasn\u2019t me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us.  I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers.",
        "Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.",
        "Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?",
        "We\u2019ll talk.",
        "Are you sure?",
        "My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn\u2019t that strange? I\u2019ve never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that\u2019s nice. Thank you.",
        "Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer.",
        "Everyone, this Bert, my son. Bert, this is\u2026 a paper company.",
        "Here, use this one.",
        "Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son?",
        "Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us.",
        "Extraordinary. Did you plan this?",
        "Delightful.",
        "Now then, how are we today?",
        "Just fine, Kelly? Everything alright?",
        "You feeling fulfilled in your life?",
        "You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have.",
        "Because it\u2019s too terrifying to imagine. Now we\u2019re cooking. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours?",
        "Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby?",
        "What are we talking about?",
        "You seem unimpressed.  Ghosts don\u2019t scare you?",
        "It\u2019s true.  They\u2019ve been preserved for thousands of years.  They\u2019re all over.",
        "Why didn\u2019t you simply ask Andy to clarify?  Asking is a very easy thing to do.  You\u2019re obviously very close. .  Oh I see.  This no longer seems like my business .",
        "You were going to talk at the end of the\u2026 I\u2019m not here.",
        "I\u2019m never uncomfortable.",
        "I should go.",
        "Looks terribly real, doesn\u2019t it, Creed?",
        "Are you scared of snakes?",
        "What am I up to?",
        "When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family\u2019s. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound.  She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby\u2019s crib, was a snake wrapped around baby\u2019s neck, squeezing tighter and tighter.",
        "The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies.",
        "Amongst them was a man, tall, slim.",
        "Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. \u201cOh, wait,\u201d she thought, \u201cI don\u2019t have a husband.\u201d For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn\u2019t get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn\u2019t, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, \u201cBaby, are you okay?\u201d Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, b!tch, I\u2019m fine.\u201d",
        "Fear plays an interesting role in our lives. How dare we let it motivate us. How dare we let it into our decision making, into our livelihoods, into our relationships. It\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it, we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear.",
        "What are we talking about?",
        "Have you seen a ghost?",
        "No, no. I\u2019m very comfortable with all things sexual. Continue.",
        "Have you considered the possibility that you slept with a drifter?",
        "This is atrocious.",
        "The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy, careless, error prone office.",
        "Did you need something from us?",
        "Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free.",
        "Who are they?",
        "Andrew sometimes I feel like you don\u2019t know me at all.",
        "Simply\u00e2\u20ac end the mistakes",
        "When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice?",
        "End the mistakes. That is all I ask.  And you can\u2019t have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don\u2019t know food at all.",
        "I\u2019ll see you next week Will.",
        "Jim what are you\u00e2\u20ac What a surprise.",
        "Yeah.",
        "A game or a match?",
        "In the box.",
        "Sounded like mine.",
        "Well, it\u2019s mine. You took it out of my bag.",
        "Can I have it?",
        "Yep.",
        "Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa.",
        "ha, Jesus.",
        "Nah, it\u2019s good.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It\u2019s the standard one. The one everyone has.",
        "It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting?",
        "My serve!",
        "Take it easy. Nice and easy.",
        "Oo!",
        "You alright?",
        "Skinned knee.",
        "Oo, a little ice on that maybe.",
        "Okay. My serve.",
        "Eleven love. I win again.",
        "I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Why? Not only are you terrible at squash, but you don\u2019t even seem to enjoy it. Jim, this is not enough of a challenge for me.",
        "Let\u2019s wait, until we have something to smoke about.",
        "Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here?",
        "You\u2019re a band.",
        "I miss being in a band.",
        "Tambourine? You know I\u2019m the CEO, right?",
        "I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car.",
        "Hey, you found us!",
        "Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding.",
        "You guys mind if they join us?",
        "What should we play?",
        "Midnight Rambler?",
        "Oh, hi there.",
        "Where is everyone? Where is Andy?",
        "Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here\u2026 is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you\u2019ve shown you\u2019re the free-thinkers of the office.",
        "So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don\u2019t be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith!  Excited!",
        "I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let\u2019s dig in, shall we?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This idea hasn\u2019t gripped me. What else did you come up with?",
        "That was bad.",
        "The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I\u2019m familiar with.",
        "No.",
        "I am not.",
        "Kevin, you\u2019ve been quiet. I\u2019m curious to know what your game-changer is.",
        "Cookies. Cookie placement.",
        "Who else agrees with Kevin, that we\u2019re wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers?  There you go. Consensus.",
        "Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin\u2019s oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants?",
        "That\u2019s the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic.",
        "And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared?",
        "Right.  I mean you\u2019re an accountant.  Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.",
        "Kevin!",
        "Big Mac idea.  That sounds encouraging.",
        "Well what is the idea?",
        "Oh my.  It was just actually cookies the whole time?",
        "Haha! There he is. You mind lending a hand? I\u2019m typing up a memo to share your ideas with the board.",
        "Great\u2026.ok.",
        "In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.  There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?",
        "Everyone. I\u2019d like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone.",
        "Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she\u2019s here today to see if there\u2019s a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager.",
        "Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she\u2019ll shine.",
        "Andy. Let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a good fit first. Then we\u2019ll talk.",
        "Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn\u2019t you agree Andy?",
        "Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I\u2019ll just duck out and run the company for a while.",
        "Are you telling me that there\u2019s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?",
        "I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.",
        "No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.",
        "I would be eternally grateful. It\u2019s not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.",
        "Say hello grandma.",
        "Hold one finger up to Susan. You\u2019ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, \u201care you taking your medicine?\u201d",
        "Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it.",
        "Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We\u2019ll fix this.",
        "Please. Andrew, my wife\u2026 has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.",
        "Oh, still here. Terrific.",
        "Well that\u2019s a shame.",
        "Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?",
        "What\u2019s the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "No games.",
        "Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It\u2019s gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest.",
        "Andy, just answer the question.",
        "No games.",
        "You lying son of a bitch!",
        "Tell my wife you\u2019re lying.",
        "This is preposterous.",
        "Let\u2019s get Jim in here.  Where\u2019s Jim?",
        "Can you call security, tell \u2019em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.",
        "That\u2019s weird. Well, he\u2019s gotta be around here somewhere.",
        "Hello Jim.",
        "So I think you know what we want to know.",
        "Yes.",
        "No.",
        "All right. Thanks.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Heh.",

        "Erin, what can I get for you?",
        "Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots!",
        "The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you\u2019re at a party and you\u2019re an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too.",

        "Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m not going to be able to meet with you, but I\u2019m leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.",
        "No, he\u2019s going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don\u2019t want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He\u2019s a great person to know. I\u2019ll dialogue with him tonight.",
        "Gabe, listen to me. Don\u2019t bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight\u2019s pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard.",
        "It\u2019s a command.",
        "Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.",
        "Shalom.  Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours.  I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle Stu once a month.",
        "Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge.",
        "They haven\u2019t really improved on the Oreo, have they?",
        "Sit down, Dwight.",
        "You were dining alone? All those people are you?",
        "Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager\u2019s job. And Florida, you don\u2019t want to live here. Even I don\u2019t want to live here. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America\u2019s basement: It\u2019s wet, it\u2019s filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right?",
        "This medal was my grandfather\u2019s. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It\u2019s a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better?",
        "Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I\u2019ll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.",
        "I\u2019m selling the house, actually.",
        "It\u2019s mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I\u2019ve got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue\u2026 this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she\u2019s left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They\u2019re calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room.  Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?",
        "What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?",
        "Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it.",
        "A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I\u2019m entitled to the occasional bad day.",
        "What, as some sort of last hoorah?",
        "You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow.  Let\u2019s try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let\u2019s just call it a get-together. And let\u2019s say no food.",
        "You should see the whole thing.",
        "I\u2019m just about to give the tour.",
        "Join us. You must see what you were laughing about.",
        "Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you\u2019re simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio.",
        "Wine collection.",
        "About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers.",
        "Oh.",
        "Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it.",
        "I don\u2019t know. Maybe not. Just come.",
        "I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan.",
        "To the kitchen. Onward!",
        "I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.",
        "When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies: Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden  Pond.",
        "And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.",
        "Gentlemen, bear witness. While I\u2019ve been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party.",
        "Yes, that\u2019s it. Push yourselves, boys. It\u2019s not a party if you don\u2019t do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going.",
        "This room I liked for the view. I dreamed that I would watch my guests walk to their cars at dawn, their faces flushed with the shame and regret for the choices they made the night before.",
        "Nellie.",
        "How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?",
        "Good.",
        "Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Now. Let\u2019s find you something fun to do here, shall we?",
        "We have a manager.",
        "Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?",
        "Andy, it\u2019s Robert. Why aren\u2019t you at work?",
        "I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t care. Please come to work immediately.",
        "He just hung up on me mid-sentence.",
        "Not much we can do about this until he gets here.",
        "Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim.",
        "This is an odd situation. But it\u2019s very interesting how it\u2019s playing out.",
        "We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone\u2019s lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?",
        "I am not. Huh.",
        "Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?",
        "Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.",
        "Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?",
        "When two animals are having sex, one of them\u2026",
        "\u2026 is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua\u2013 this isn\u2019t very helpful. You\u2019re gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.",
        "All life is sex. And all sex is competition.",
        "And there are no rules to that game. That wasn\u2019t so perverted, now was it?",
        "My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn\u2019t he decide who the manager is?",
        "Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie\u2019s leadership. I believe.",
        "\u201cGood morning, Robert,\u201d says no one because our receptionist is in Florida.  Pam!",
        "Is this a video conference you\u2019re having with \u201cDrake, featuring Swizz Beatz\u201d?",
        "People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-",
        "Nellie, really, nine fifty?",
        "Ah.",
        "I\u2019ve never believed willpower was very important in a woman.",
        "I don\u2019t think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.",
        "No, no, no, no. There\u2019s something going on. Some stress in your life.",
        "Nellie?",
        "You\u2019re clearly under a lot of\u2026 stress with the moving and the work situation you\u2019ve found yourself in.",
        "Let\u2019s help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place.",
        "The rest of you, let\u2019s throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.",
        "This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.",
        "Cheers.",
        "no, Nellie, she-",
        "Oh, no, you-",
        "Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?",
        "Well Nellie, I\u2019m sorry. If I\u2019d known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-",
        "Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party.",
        "Nellie! You\u2019ve been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-",
        "I\u2019m sorry?",
        "I\u2019m not accustomed to people saying no to me.",
        "You\u2019re both adults. I\u2019m sure you can figure this out between yourselves.",
        "I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I\u2019ve had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.",
        "Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is \u201cimpotence.\u201d",
        "It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating.",
        "Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.",
        "No, that\u2019s absolutely the case.",
        "Andy, why don\u2019t you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they\u2019d like to share?",
        "I almost didn\u2019t come in today.",
        "Andy, why don\u2019t you just take a seat?",
        "Andy, Erin, you can join us now.",
        "Andy, we\u2019re going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we\u2019ll all laugh about this incident. I already think it\u2019s kind of funny.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Well you can\u2019t say no.",
        "Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job.",
        "Andrew, if you say no one more time, you\u2019re fired. So\u2026 is there anything else you wanna say?",
        "Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I\u2019m being strangled like I\u2019m at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick\u2019s?",
        "Andrew.",
        "I stepped in right away and start\u2013",
        "Well\u2026",
        "So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?",
        "and the hero, who\u2019s that based on?",
        "Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don\u2019t you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?",
        "Andy you should leave. Now.",
        "Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!",
        "The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes!",
        "Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don\u2019t often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will",
        "Andy, that\u2019s very kind\u2013",
        "Andy why don\u2019t we discuss this at a\u2013",
        "Everyone, conference room, now.",
        "Shh\u2026 shh\u2026",
        "Can everyone just, please\u2026 I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and \u2013 how should I say this \u2013 Columbian whites. What \u2013 what is this about, uh, Binghamton?",
        "Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I\u2019m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.",
        "Wonderful.",
        "Pam, when\u2019s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn\u2019t hold the memories in?",
        "Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.",
        "Yes, \u2018course. Why don\u2019t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.",
        "Let\u2019s do it now. What\u2019s number one?",
        "There we go.",
        "Where\u2019s the Advil, Jim? I think I\u2019ve hit my limit on the Tylenol \u2013 Oh.",
        "Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?",
        "Oh, for god \u2013",
        "Harry\u2026",
        "How do you mean?",
        "Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There\u2019s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems\u2026 so poorly timed.",
        "I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said\u2026",
        "Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there?  They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I\u2019ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.",
        "Now we get to the bottom of Nellie\u2019s \u201cyes, yes, yes, yes, never.\u201d",
        "Oh yes it can.",
        "Shopaholic.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ah.",
        "Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.",
        "No, come on.",

        "Yeah, hello?",
        "You\u2019re blackmailing me.",
        "Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You\u2019re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don\u2019t even know my real name. I\u2019m the *bleep* lizard king.",

        "Fine.",

        "It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail.  A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.",
        "I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I\u2019m gonna go someplace else and you\u2019re gonna go someplace else. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.",
        "This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael\u2019s gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it\u2019s for the best.",
        "Is Jim coming back.",
        "I just don\u2019t want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.",
        "Oh, yeah, totally.",
        "Uh yeah, we\u2019ll meet you there.",
        "Hey, buddy. Welcome back.",

        "Thanks.",

        "Prison sounds great.",
        "Michael, please.",
        "Ah man, I can\u2019t.",
        "I\u2019m not feeling so well. I\u2019ve got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here.  Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.",

        "I\u2019m serious. It\u2019ll show that we don\u2019t care about material things.",
        "Kelly, I\u2019m so cold!",
        "Are you having fun in this relationship?",
        "I don\u2019t know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think\u2026",
        "Did you look over here?",
        "Kelly.",
        "Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He\u2019s so weird.",
        "No, you\u2019re perfect.  What? Did you find it?",
        "All of a sudden?",
        "I don\u2019t know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael\u2019s way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt.",
        "We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we\u2019re supposed to.",
        "I am very flattered. I was his second choice after \u201cPass.\u201d",
        "Is there a prize?",
        "Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?",
        "Yeah, if you don\u2019t mind.",
        "Hi.",
        "Um\u2026  Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.",
        "Oh\u2026",
        "Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.",
        "What?",
        "Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.",
        "Yeah, me too.",
        "He hasn\u2019t even said a word yet.  Just giggling.",
        "Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?",
        "Oh gross.",
        "Kelly don\u2019t do this.",
        "You know what you\u2019re doing.",
        "Ok.",

        "alright.  See you there.",

        "Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?",
        "Here\u2019s the thing. Um, I\u2019ve tried it like five different ways in my head and \u2013 Oh, got one. Um, I\u2019m such a perfectionist\u2026",
        "That I\u2019d kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.",

        "Great.",

        "Yes!",

        "Maybe we weren\u2019t right together, but\u2026 it\u2019s weird. I\u2019d rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?",
        "I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.",
        "Yeah, the fractional ownership property.  Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.",

        "Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.",
        "Well that\u2019s your opinion and it\u2019s her opinion, but it\u2019s not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.",
        "Well a lot of people would say that I\u2019m a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.",
        "For Kelly?",
        "Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can\u2019t even read it. My heart couldn\u2019t handle it.",
        "No. It would cause me too much pain.",
        "This poem would crush you!",
        "You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.",

        "Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don\u2019t interrupt.",
        "Well you do a lot, so just don\u2019t. Thank you. I know that I haven\u2019t always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.",
        "What is your problem?  Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.",
        "Can we turn this -ing thing around? Thank you.",
        "Thank you. Kelly, I can\u2019t promise you that we\u2019ll always stay together. I can\u2019t promise you that I\u2019ll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren\u2019t built that way. Men aren\u2019t built that way. There\u2019s a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we\u2019ll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.",
        "Will you roll those dice with me?",
        "No you don\u2019t.",
        "No you don\u2019t.",

        "Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I\u2019m the first to know.",
        "Oh you liked him? That\u2019s nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I\u2019m glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.",
        "Huh?",
        "Oh God, Nellie! What wasn\u2019t his? I mean, um, \u201cTracks of my Tears\u201d?",

        "Okay, I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not playing this game, Pam. Not today.",
        "Okay, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.",
        "That\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s not the point!",
        "Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?",
        "Okay well, that\u2019s a relief!",
        "Yeah\u2026 Who\u2019s opening?",
        "Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don\u2019t think I can see this.",
        "How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That\u2019s not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.",
        "Don\u2019t call me a clown, Pam. You\u2019re better than that!",
        "Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.",
        "I've actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It's a big university town. And, uh, that's not garbage, it's out clothes.",

        "Yeah.",
        "No Kelly, he\u2019s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It\u2019s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.",

        "Alright.",
        "No.",
        "How would we get home?",
        "Hi, Jan.",
        "Just preparing for the deposition.",
        "This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.",
        "Sure.",
        "Ok, um, one thing that you\u2019re gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It\u2019s recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you\u2019re gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.",
        "Um, yeah.  You\u2019re computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it\u2019s also recommended that you step away for about\u2026 about ten minutes every hour.",
        "No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.",
        "Well, that\u2019ll work.",
        "You know, anything that warms you.",
        "Sedentary.",
        "Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.",
        "Nice.",

        "What\u2019s going on?",
        "I don\u2019t think laughing about it is an appropriate response.",
        "I don\u2019t think the women in this office \u2013",
        "I was at a parent-teacher conference.",
        "Hey, uh\u2026 where\u2019d you decide to take Karen tonight?",
        "I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.",
        "Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.",
        "It\u2019s Beach Day\u2026",
        "Hey, want my sun screen?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo\u2019s Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so\u2026 uh, I got a week of free pies.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, Michael, you can\u2019t ask about religious beliefs\u2026",
        "Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.",
        "Hey!",
        "I\u2019m makin\u2019 great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.",
        "And the winner is Toby Flenderson.",
        "Where are we?",
        "He couldn\u2019t have made it a circle?",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, Kelly\u2019s been so upset about Ryan dumping her, that she can\u2019t even talk.",
        "Ohh.",
        "Yes, uh some people in the office have complained\u2026",
        "\u2026about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know  I just wanted to remind it\u2019s not appropriate to, to do that.",
        "Ok, look the memo is not about you\u2026",
        "Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So\u2026",
        "Yes.",
        "Hey\u2026  you two.",
        "Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know  relationships, so\u2026 if, if this is just a casual thing, there\u2019s no need, really.",
        "Uh huh.",
        "Let\u2019s just wait and see what happens.  You know?",
        "Let\u2019s just wait.",
        "Technically, he\u2019s right.",
        "Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.",
        "This is everybody else\u2026 okay\u2026 This is the place\u2026 so thanks for the lift.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I just really like you.",
        "Have a great day!",
        "I wouldn\u2019t want to do that now would I?",
        "The lady cop acted like she\u2019d never pulled someone over for driving too slow.  And I tried to get out of it with the famous Toby Flenderson 10,000 watt smile.  It didn\u2019t work.",
        "Damn it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I remember.",
        "Thanks Kelly.",
        "Colorblind.",
        "It\u2019s out of context.  It\u2019s not the same as driving.",
        "It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.",
        "To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.",
        "Well, you know how everyone fast forwards through ads these days? Well, what about an ad in slow motion. You know, if they fast forward through it, it\u2019ll just seem normal and it will catch your eye. Plus, uh, the slogan could be: Dunder Mifflin, we adapt to the pace of your business.",
        "I spent three years in advertising before I came here.",
        "I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.",
        "Alright, just know that you\u2019re not in the Finer Things Club.",
        "Fun?",
        "Really?",
        "What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?",
        "Did you even read it?",
        "Who was the main character?",
        "He\u2019s gonna ruin everything.",
        "I like it just us three.   I don\u2019t want it to change.",
        "I love The Finer Things Club.  My ex-wife used to have a book club, and I would read their book and sometimes listen from the kitchen.",
        "I really didn\u2019t think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.",
        "Oh, it wasn\u2019t camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat.",
        "Michael.",
        "Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.",
        "Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s\u2019mores, that I finally had to say, \u201cNo more s\u2019mores, no more s\u2019mores.\u201d",
        "Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience",

        "Hey Jim.",
        "Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.",
        "Yeah\u2026",
        "My birthday was two months ago.",
        "There was no party.",
        "Well, it\u2026 there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.",
        "I don\u2019t know, I just thought you could include me.",
        "I just though you could add me.  I don\u2019t see the harm in that.",
        "I\u2019m allergic to mushrooms.",
        "Forcing your employees to set you up is not a, uh, uh, technical violation of any Dunder Mifflin rule.  You know, but neither is forcing them to help you with a shot-by-shot remake of Indiana Jones.  Huh-how do you make a rule book like that?",
        "I might have it in here.",
        "It\u2019s so random that I have it.",
        "When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.",
        "No.",
        "Sorry guys, but I don\u2019t think I tipped him for last year\u2019s.",

        "Course you do.",
        "More like \u201cEveryone let\u2019s get your boss laid Saturday.\u201d   I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I\u2019m finally gonna do it. So, I\u2019m just gonna hop the fence and jog home now.",
        "Can I talk to you a second?",
        "Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning\u2026",
        "Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He didn\u2019t seem like he was joking.",
        "Alright\u2026 Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking\u2026",
        "Um, why don\u2019t you go ask him that?",
        "You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter\u2019s stomach hurts when there\u2019s a mean girl at school\u2026",
        "I\u2019d say all the goofing around at Pam\u2019s desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him\u2026 w-with Pam",
        "Well, you can actually fire him.",
        "Well, as you know, Dwight has filed a lot of complaints against you over the years.",
        "But now it\u2019s being looked at as more of a productivity issue.",
        "I know, um, but Ryan thinks that, uh, they\u2019re not good enough.",
        "Morning.",
        "Good morning, Kelly.",
        "Fine. Good.",
        "As part of my last day I\u2019m training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.",
        "So this is H.R. This is your desk.",
        "Yeah, it\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Hey, Stanley\u2026",
        "I want to introduce you to\u2026",
        "Hey Michael.",
        "I\u2019d like to introduce you to my replacement.",
        "Come on.",
        "Michael Scott, this is Holly.",
        "Nothing.",
        "You\u2019re-you\u2019re not in it.",
        "I love it. I love it\u2026 I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.",
        "No, uh\u2026  Does anyone have a camera here?  No one has a camera here. Uh\u2026",
        "I\u2019m gonna\u2026 I\u2019ll go get one. Stay.",
        "What\u2019d you guys do?",
        "Well, we still have to do the exit interview.",

        "Hi Pam. Stay.",
        "I\u2019m Toby.",
        "This place, um\u2026",
        "I\u2019ve got some ideas, I guess\u2026",
        "Well let me see\u2026 I would, uh\u2026",
        "I guess everything\u2019s okay.",
        "I made it this far, right? What\u2019s the point?",
        "\u201cSuck on this.\u201d",
        "Thanks, I\u2019m gonna set it to Costa Rica time.",
        "I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn\u2019t-",
        "Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don\u2019t have a picture of the two of us.",
        "Yeah, could we\u2026",
        "This one right here.",
        "It\u2019s digital, so just take as many as you want.",
        "Thanks\u2026  Really, Michael?",
        "It\u2019s not.",
        "Oh, some kind of\u2026 alarm.",
        "This is Jim Halpert\u2026",
        "And Pam Beesly.",
        "You\u2019re welcome.",
        "This is a picture I\u2019ve been carrying around in my wallet for about six years.  It\u2019s this unspoiled beach in Costa Rica, Playa Grande.  Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down.  Never thought I\u2019d get to live here, you know.  But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, I guess it will be my, uh, thing in Costa Rica, be a nature photographer.",
        "Yeah. Um, you mind if I get a picture?",
        "Think you could\u2026 Okay.  Okay.",
        "Uh, no, that\u2019s okay.",
        "Okay, okay, I\u2019m going.",
        "Well, uh, okay. Um.  It\u2019s really great to be here tonight, with the Ferris wheel, the band, and the low sunlight.  I\u2019m gonna miss you all when I go to Costa Rica, and if I keep drinking beer like this, I\u2019m gonna have to take a leak-a.   Look, on a more personal note, I just want to say thanks, you know, no matter what was going on in my life, you know, my divorce, or the custody battle, or that thing with my sister, it was just nice knowing I had a, a supportive place to come to where\u2026",
        "I\u2019m gonna really miss going to beers with you guys every Tuesday night  and lastly, I\u2019d love to urge you to keep up with my fight to have the building checked for radon gas.  You know, it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a real serious matter, and every time I try to have the, uh\u2026",
        "\u2026building looked into\u2026",
        "Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica.  I guess the harness wasn\u2019t strapped in exactly right.  I broke my neck.  And, I\u2019ve been in the hospital five weeks now.  I still haven\u2019t seen the beach.  It\u2019s nice to have visitors.",
        "No, but I\u2019m going zip lining tomorrow, through the, through the rainforest, with this cool couple I, I met at my hotel.  Wo-woman\u2019s amazing\u2026",
        "Hey, is that Michael?  Does he miss me?    Uh, Oscar?  Are you there?  Hello?",
        "It was terrible.",
        "I prefer being stuck in a Costa Rican hospital.",
        "Not really.",
        "Hi, Micha-",
        "Well thanks Michael.",
        "Well that\u2019s sweet, I missed you guys too.",
        "Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine\u2026",
        "\u2026and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.",
        "It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.",
        "And uh, yeah, plus it was hot.",
        "Are you all right, Michael?",
        "Hey guys that\u2019s really inappropriate.",
        "I\u2019m not going to punch you, Michael.",
        "No, why would I punch you?",
        "Hey, what is this?",
        "Why?",
        "Hey, what\u2019s going on?  You don\u2019t have my permission to do this.",
        "Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?",
        "Don\u2019t search my stuff.",
        "I have a reasonable right to privacy.",
        "Michael!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "That was\u2026 I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?",
        "That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.",
        "What is going on here?",
        "Of course not!",
        "I didn\u2019t put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.",
        "Did you?",
        "You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.",
        "I did leave.",
        "Well, I don\u2019t see it that way.",
        "What?",
        "We should really have the office\u2019s air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.",
        "You\u2019ll see.",
        "Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith\u2019s work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.",
        "Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don\u2019t know what your doing.",
        "Okay you know, this\u2013 this is over.",
        "Sure. Wow.  Ow\u2026",
        "Hey Sasha, it\u2019s daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?",
        "No, No, No.  No, I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve heard of it.",
        "This is great.  My ex-wife\u2019s going to be so pissed.   For once daddy\u2019s gonna be a hero.",
        "Hey, I\u2019d like to buy one of your dolls.",
        "Oh, no, I\u2013 no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.",
        "I was\u2013 I was gonna get the doll.",
        "But I\u2013 I promised my daughter. Darryl, look\u2013 I\u2013 I need the doll, I need the doll.  I\u2013 I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m begging you.  I just\u2013 I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.",
        "I only have $200.",
        "Oh man, thanks, thank you,  thank you, thank you.",
        "Oh thanks.  She\u2019s gonna\u2026  oh\u2026",
        "No.  It\u2019s even\u2013 it\u2019s even better than the one I wanted.",
        "Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, it\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s something to watch.  And when it\u2019s over you\u2019re like\u2026 how much time is left on this flight? Now what?",
        "Not much? What\u2019s up with you?  Nah it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It\u2019s so good. No, you gotta tune in, it\u2019s as good as anything on HBO.  Hey does blue go with tan?",
        "I have like, like a blue shirt? I don\u2019t wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.",
        "You have to stop.",
        "Can\u2019t you just not look at his feet?",
        "Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out \u2019cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn\u2019t say I have a passion for H.R.",
        "I could loan you a pair of socks.",
        "No, they\u2019re clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.",
        "Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?",
        "Your outfit.",
        "You\u2013you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It\u2019s ri\u2013it\u2019s riding up a little high.",
        "All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.",
        "All right, come.  Sit down, Dwight.",
        "I\u2019m running this meeting.",
        "It\u2019s not.  It\u2019s not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.",
        "Casual Fridays are cancelled.    Let\u2019s just not do it anymore.",
        "There\u2019s not a single appropriate outfit in this whole\u2013except mine, quite honestly.",
        "Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.",
        "Really, really funny.",
        "What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?",
        "And that\u2019s how you broke your ankle?",
        "I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.",
        "He has a doctor\u2019s note.",
        "A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.",
        "That\u2019s not a very good Darryl.",
        "Hmmm.",
        "Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didn\u2019t reach the top shelf.  I don\u2019t know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.   I\u2019ll punch you in da mush, see.",
        "Sounds like a EMDP-40.",
        "You\u2019re into trains?",
        "Wow.",
        "That\u2019s so cool.",
        "Wow, I\u2019d love to take a look at that.",
        "Well, you know, \u2019cause of  the trains.",
        "Uhh, oh boy, oh boy.",
        "Get over there!  Get over there!",
        "I can\u2019t believe this.  Hey you, ass****!",
        "You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?",
        "Just keep going.",
        "If they were dilated\u2026",
        "No, nah.  I don\u2019t see it.",
        "Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we\u2019re here to apologize ahh\u2026",
        "What?",
        "Well, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to check \u2019em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain\u2026",
        "You really did it\u2026",
        "Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our\u2026 with our lives.",
        "So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.",
        "Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.",
        "What?",
        "",
        "Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.",
        "Well the \u201cfun\u201d is in it.",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Oscar says I checked out huh?  Huh.",
        "Hey, Jim.",
        "Oh, Jesus!",
        "What did I do?",
        "Yeah, sure, what\u2019s up?",
        "Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.",
        "Yeah, er\u2026 pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.",
        "Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.",
        "Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.",
        "Yeah\u2026 that\u2019s why they pay me the big bucks.",
        "I\u2019m good\u2026",
        "You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we\u2019d become friends.",
        "Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?",
        "Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that\u2019s happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.",
        "Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off\u2026 you know\u2026",
        "Buddy, I think that\u2026",
        "Pam, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "I heard about the hit.  Just\u2013 make sure it\u2019s off company property, right?",
        "Okay, I think we should probably be okay.",
        "Okay.  And\u2013 the-the power\u2013 comes from the back foot.  So its\u2013 its all one motion through the\u2013 body.  So you stay a little low and there\u2019s a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.   Pow!",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay.",
        "Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.",
        "You can\u2019t,  Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.",
        "No!",
        "Wow! Cause\u2026",
        "Thank you!",
        "Thanks man!",
        "What are, are you doing at my desk?",
        "Come on, Dwight. Get out of here.",
        "Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Um\u2026 nothing comes to mind.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Happy\u2019s a funny word.",
        "You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy.  Keep philosophers busy for awhile.",
        "Yes.",
        "Generally happy.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t know.",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "I don\u2019t know. No.",
        "I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get through this. I don\u2019t want to lie and I DON\u2019T want to tell the truth.",
        "Well, Eric\u2019s just going over some stuff.",
        "It\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s HR stuff.",
        "Look, you know, in any company  there\u2019s going to be certain degrees \u2013",
        "Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.",
        "Oop.",
        "Looks like we kicked it.",
        "Oh, one more!",
        "If we don\u2019t patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there\u2019ll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.",
        "Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?",
        "I don\u2019t think this fax is going through. Is there a different\u2026 I can just put it through again, you know.",
        "I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can\u2019t dock your pay. That\u2019s not legal.",
        "Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure\u2026",
        "This here is a radon test kit.  Okay I will be putting \u2019em everywhere. And\u2026 please don\u2019t throw these out.  This is a radon test kit.  Please don\u2019t throw these out.  See them all over the office.",
        "Come on, Michael. You\u2019re interrupting.",
        "Please sit down.",
        "I don\u2019t wanna do this.",
        "Hey everyone.",
        "Well, that\u2019s\u2026",
        "Good.",
        "Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I\u2019ve been working on.",
        "Oh, uh, I don\u2019t know, uh\u2026",
        "Oh\u2026 yes.",
        "Write your own damn novel.",
        "I\u2019m hungry.",
        "Well, that was better.",
        "Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019m really looking forward to working with you, Michael.",
        "What\u2019s something that you\u2026",
        "Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I\u2019ve got a chance to do some good here.",
        "We can do this with more privacy.",
        "I\u2019d like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it\u2019s the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.",
        "Uh\u2026 what was your favorite flavor of\u2026",
        "What?",
        "Ok, I can\u2019t count the hour if you don\u2019t talk.",
        "Michael, it\u2019s up to me to check off the boxes, and I can\u2019t do that unless I honestly\u2026",
        "Tell me!",
        "I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.",
        "Of course.",
        "Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.",
        "Oh.",
        "You know what Michael? You\u2019re right. You win. This is pointless. We\u2019re not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don\u2019t we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?",
        "We can play something more complicated if you like.",
        "So you have played it before?",
        "Who\u2019s Jeff?",
        "So, her husband, your stepdad?",
        "Did you guys do much stuff together?",
        "It\u2019s working. I\u2019m doing it!",
        "Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?",
        "Why?",
        "Dogs don\u2019t do that.",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "It\u2019s very important for you to be liked, isn\u2019t it?",
        "I\u2019m just trying to help you Michael.",
        "I just want to\u2026",
        "Just fill them out any way you want.",
        "I\u2019ll have Erin fax them back to corporate.",
        "Yes.",
        "He seems fine.",
        "Heh.",
        "You filled them in and faxed them yourself!",
        "You remember that.",
        "Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.",
        "It\u2019s a great stick, right?",
        "Thanks!",
        "No.",
        "Oh.",
        "Sunday church service\u2026 it\u2019s been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.",
        "Okay, this is, all right, this is silly.   Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope\u2026",
        "Why you always got to be so mean to me?",
        "Hi guys.",
        "Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I\u2019ll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.",
        "Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.",
        "Okay, that\u2019s hurtful talk. We\u2019ve talked about that. You know, I don\u2019t interrupt your announcements.",
        "Well, I really can\u2019t talk about it, but it\u2019s a very high profile case.",
        "Yes.",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "Come on.",
        "Guys, it\u2019s a really big deal.",
        "I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019ll be up to my neck in jury duty.",
        "Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.",
        "Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.",
        "Yeah, uh, she\u2019ll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey.",
        "Uh, we\u2019re on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.",
        "I can\u2019t talk about it or I\u2019ll get removed from the jury.",
        "I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we\u2019re just talking.",
        "Oh, Jim. Hey.",
        "There\u2019s this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse\u2026",
        "Who looks exactly like you.",
        "Yeah. No, it\u2019s uncanny.",
        "What?",
        "No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.",
        "No, they bring it in.",
        "In meetings.",
        "I really disagree with this. I think it\u2019s kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man\u2019s being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I\u2019m not so sure he\u2019s guilty any more.",
        "Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.",
        "Okay.",
        "Here\u2019s the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.",
        "Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-",
        "Well, no. He hates jams.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Hey, what happened?",
        "Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I\u2019ve never used the gun violence forms before.",
        "I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this?",
        "Would you consider this a terrorist incident?",
        "Oh, there\u2019s a whole \u2018nother terrorism booklet for that.",
        "Uh, well, we probably don\u2019t want to go just on seniority.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, what is your three-step plan?",
        "W-What?",
        "How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?",
        "Uh\u2026 Human Resources.",
        "Yes.",
        "So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?",
        "Well, it\u2019s one of my strengths, but it\u2019s the manager\u2019s job.",
        "Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?",
        "I\u2019m sorry, if we did something to upset you, I\u2019m sure it was inadvertent.",
        "I didn\u2019t think you were.",
        "But there aren\u2019t\u2026",
        "Well, we could try him out for a little while\u2026  and if it doesn\u2019t work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in\u2026",
        "No, no,\u2026 no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk.",
        "I should not be here. I\u2019m in the- I was in the wrong- I\u2019m- I\u2019m sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.",
        "Guys. Really, it\u2019s ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason for anybody to worry.",
        "I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here.",
        "Chicken piccata, side salad.",
        "I thought I was T-Dog.",
        "I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh.  Flenderson files.",
        "If I won the lottery, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d make any changes to my life. Quit my job, move, meet someone\u2026.",
        "Hey, where do I park?",
        "Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.",
        "It\u2019s probably okay\u2026",
        "I think it\u2019s better that I\u2026",
        "It\u2019s a finicky car\u2026",
        "It\u2019s a little tricky, you might have to\u2026 take\u2026",
        "Every Halloween I tell him the same thing \u2013 You can\u2019t bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing \u2013 As soon as I get my weapons back I\u2019m gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I\u2019m a lucky turkey.",
        "If you turn out the lights we\u2019ll do a little dance.",
        "Great.",
        "So great.",
        "Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry\u2026",
        "\u2026bones. What?",
        "What\u2026 you can\u2019t\u2026 Gabe? Are you\u2026",
        "For you?",
        "Who are you seeing? That\u2019s gr\u00e2\u20ac",
        "Oh.",
        "You know I don\u2019t have to do the paperwork unless you\u2019re actually dating.",
        "But I mean\u00e2\u20ac uh have you talked to her? Is sh\u00e2\u20ac",
        "Do you know her last name, yet?",
        "She\u2019s going to be screaming her own last name?",
        "Good luck Gabe.",
        "It\u2019s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.",
        "Radiant.",
        "You know it\u2019s not just pregnant women who don\u2019t get their due. You know who\u2019s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.",
        "You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It\u2019s a pregnant Helen Mirren.",
        "Did you bring your passport with you?",
        "Well, I do. Always ready for adventure.",
        "No.",
        "Oh my god.",
        "You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.",
        "Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he\u2019s also the world\u2019s leading Egyptologist.",
        "No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.",

        "I would love that.",
        "Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I\u2019m through the gateway now, though, right?",
        "Bears.",
        "To madness.",

        "You mean food truck. Ernesto\u2019s was a food truck.",
        "Ernesto!",
        "Yeah, hey.",
        "It\u2019s the empanada guy.",
        "It has been a long, lonely winter.",
        "It is real, thank you for saying that.",
        "Me?",
        "Yeah, um\u2026 I can\u2019t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I\u2019ll go put on my cup.",
        "Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So\u2026 strike, scream, and run. All right? Let\u2019s try it.",
        "That may have been my fault.",
        "Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you\u2019re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the groin.\u201d",
        "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very common.",
        "Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.",
        "It\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel\u2026  written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.",
        "All right, well, let\u2019s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn\u2019t everyone stand? Okay, so\u2026 you\u2019re being attacked. You\u2019ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.",
        "Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you\u2019re alive.",
        "There\u2019s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.",
        "Okay, this isn\u2019t over. Let\u2019s stay focused, okay? We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but\u2026 little things can be dangerous.",
        "Okay. Good point\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026",
        "I don\u2019t know if this is gonna help\u2026Uh\u2026",
        "We should stay to maybe some more traditional models\u2026",
        "Okay, this is what\u2019s called pre-violent posturing.",

        "Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha\u2019s first year in the troops, so I\u2019m selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?",
        "What?",
        "You can\u2019t claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can\u2019t you sell at your church or barber shop?  Or chess club, or?",

        "Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.",
        "No, no, no. It\u2019s not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?",

        "No, you hit the road, jack.",

        "No.",
        "50?",

        "No.",
        "I\u2019ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.",
        "Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that.",
        "Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.",

        "Just three single guys. Getting into trouble.",
        "Hey you wanted to see me?",
        "You can only fire Nellie for cause.",
        "Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.",
        "Can't. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?",
        "This is a bloodbath. Alright, I'm calling this.",
