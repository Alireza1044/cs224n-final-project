i meant that as a compliment to you phyllis, as well as a slight to andy.
go all hammurabi on this clown.
no, no, no, no, no.
i am so sorry.
good point.
he was a volunteer sheriff too.
I will translate.
and now, a very special treat... a book my grandmutter used to read me when i was a kid.
mm-hmm.
isabelle.
so here, just take my money.
wow.
it registers every time a mistake has been made in the office.
ok, good, let us talk about that, ok?
yeah.
who stands to benefit from our downfall?
or melons.
ready?!
you gave all the love that i needed... pum pum pum pum pum pum pum bye pam.
we have, in front of you here, seven different types of pennsylvania top soil.
non-organic family farmers.
surveillance, gaming- and business.
here is your knife.
damn it!
the elderly suck the life out of the young.
into a machine?!
that is true.
no, no, no.
I have seen this kid before.
absolutely not!
and that is all we have.
you know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
okay, let me finish this thought.
michael.
i do not say "hi" pam!
this is official police line tape, okay?
helping heal america in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
she is young, she is beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them.
oops.
misdemeanor?
yeah, well... seller beware.
yes!
by 2020, they are going to be the world's largest economy and they are getting a taste for protein.
bloggers are obese.
attention.
what was that?
man, look at that.
k. i brought cheese too.
phyllis put you up to this?
cancel card.
hey, we nailed the sale!
now where is my bride?
rose?
well... he is not here right now.
you are a hunter i see.
i got the surgery, what else is there to do?
say it.
what does the female vagina look like?
so the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
i have no problem with that.
please ja, ja... two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
yes, we have availability on those nights.
closest would be twin.
hang on!
oh, and andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
i was just calling to see if michael scott paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is  brenda, age four, ponytail, and simon, age 7?
michael, nice tie or something.
phyllis.
hell , rock 107.  am i the 107th caller?
what?
thank you.
do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses?
it is all right.
give me the leads.
failure of any kind is failure.
you want to get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp.
I have got a couple of shirts that do not fit so well anymore.
no, that is huge.
it always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise.
arghh.
everyone calm down.
what did i intend to do with them?
this wedding is officially out of your hands.
hello.
I am sorry, am i interrupting?
i am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
he/she/it throat rips.
you do not compare.
that is really rude.
thank you, andy.
how did you all find each other?
i do not need a key.
aaaarrhh!
your journey begins now.
it may have been the costliest decision I have ever made.
you resemble a tolkien character.
sure.
uh, hello.
look at all that sweet blubber.
what -what are you doing here?
the cake has spoken pam.
rrrah!
oh my gosh, now she is up.
god, what a steal.
psst, listen.
i bought a ticket for grizzly man and went into the wrong theatre.
unless things go well with ryan today in which case, i will not hang out with mose so much anymore.
me.
I am going to make you look like lebron james!
most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
oh, yeah, i read about that.
put me in that division.
i want... the branch.
gather round.
oh yeah, pam.
knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
you want shirts on hangers?
improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I have already covered the bm of it all.
k, fine.
f. alright, what is the damage?
how is it going?
here, pussy, pussy.
i can do that...  my resolution is... meet a loose woman.
final touch-ups.
as has creed.
uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
why is she marrying andy?
most of all, i believe that character is destiny.
continue.
are you ready to learn?
you would?
michael is gone.
have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub?
this is a stupid activity.
i want an interview.
what were you doing in there?
let us see, i know she likes apples and carrots.
it was not clear on the google image search.
you even do so little as grant me an interview, i will guarantee you your dream work life.
whoo!
or do you even know?
i play samuel, michael scarn's robot butler.
andy!
i think they both could do better.
just try and rattle rolf.
I have got some bad news.
you want to learn a really impressive second language?
i think you need to confess... ...the fact... what are you doing?
get in the van.
but i think it was worth it.
no, no.
jim!
okay, i specifically ordered a stripper.
okay... oh wait!
welcome to the eighth annual dundies awards.
morning everyone.
i just p...p...p...p pissed my pants.
we thought that she was you.
oh, you say jesus is king of kings?
space shuttle.
the decision to turn on michael was difficult.
you do not have to wrestle him.
you are an exec at stark industries, a corporation you inherited from your father- then make him pitch to you.
hm?
yes madam.
you know how they say some people were born to be bad?
the fire guy!
I am tired of being mr. perfect role model all the time.
all you have to do it say it.
i need a box.
if i do not see you again, goodbye.
do we have a desire to dominate the retail space?
rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
she is a hazard to the other people of the office.
well you left the tv on, and your cat is dead.
if you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink.
i plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere.
i sell more paper than anyone.
do i feel bad about betraying jim?
i have my own crossbow range.
i can not use phyllis.
stat means now!
i would have hired all of you!
come here.
mr. ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I am interested in your daughter?
i have been michael's #2 guy for about 5 years.
very nice.
he is either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain.
why do not you just take estrogen?
now, if michael had studied the spidey principles that I would drawn up for him, jan's boobs might not be all over the internet.
ah damn pop-ups.
but ... i do not care about assigning blame.
i am sure of it.
daraas!
go for the cliff.
is that the matsuhashi b-400?
well, actually, I will see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
my grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things.
if they stay in there too long they are going to get on the same cycle.
might get ugly.
we are stuck.
yeah!
let us get this show on the road, shall we?
uh, perhaps you will be interested in, um, mose's table making demonstration?
what did you say?
it helps our because.
a lightbulb.
thanks.
nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
i should be teaching this course.
because of the downsizing?
what did you do to it?
in keeping with schrute custom, i will either invite you to saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face.
well it is weevil season but we were prepared.
jeez!
okay, okay, i will be the first to admit it.
during that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade lsd from the military.
uh, looks awful.
perfect immune system.
but i do not have to give her the good stuff.
it was pretty awesome.
thanks you guys.
yeah.
hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster?
what do you say?
and he eats the same kind of paper i do.
I am coming over there to talk to him." and this was after i have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating.
what is a book?
paper is the manure!
wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at jim's desk while he is away in philly.
they just want to be told what to do.
no.
too bad there is not a tractor here.
now, take a lesson from stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?
what is going on?
hello.
i wish i had a lair.
not everyone approves of movie monday.
my heart just melts with the sound of children singing.
play it again.
it does, but still no.
okay, safety reasons.
pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
too bad I am not going to explain anything that you miss.
i saw someone breaking the law and i interceded.
typical american ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.
listen, scott... we are losing money, okay?
okay, okay, nobody panic.
I will go to your little show, but I am not wearing a cape.
why do not you just let me handle the tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
uh, yeah, i get a little frustrated when I am dealing with incompetence.
they want to set up their own version of an apple store.
i got a lot of responses.
as assistant regional manager... look!
get in the sidecar.
it was not here before.
but no one can become me.
no, there is no blood.
i thought michael scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
relax, ok?
saturday.
so fine, call me a sasquatch!
she tells me to stop.
you never know when your going to need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
so beautifully written.
i reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
i say we fill michael's office with bees.
wait.
i have a recurring nightmare that I have been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury.
mine was green.
ok, will you please call my cousin mose?
yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker.
no, I am no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person.
when michael was in charge, this place was like the roman empire.
oh.
yes.
oscar is out sick.
just,  boom.
back to work everyone.
do you <i>think</i>?
the ones that make you pull the car over and go, "wow, i need this beet right now."  those are the money beets.
fine.
if i can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
today is press day and press is going to make or break this store.
that is good.
thank you so much for calling.
you have no idea.
let all the other stores look like a toy store.
to you and me, maybe, but, come on!
the family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
guess how much i care on a scale of one to ten.
come on!
he is searching out younger gays.
mose!
huh?
i did not mean any of those things i just said.
it is your funeral.
this is how business... I am not closing the door.
it is called being a man.
who are you talking to?
idiots.
how many shoes do you need?
daraas!
wrong!
she was so young and now she is dead.
i could put in a good word for you, because I will still be working here.
oh, man!
that will not work.
ok, karen, ryan, pam, center stage.
contrary to what you see in the media.
this employee is obviously disgruntled!
good.
and where do trees grow?
yep.
check.
i can see that happening, yes.
now all off a sudden he is cinderella of the office.
it is not a doomsday device, gosh.
boom!
you never know when it is going to strike.
and this is my dinner on your face.
i can not help but think that something we did made this possible.
you want me to keep going?
my first order of business: make andrew bernard my number two.
let us get her.
i need a baby.
my job is to keep jan away from carol and vice versa.
40. always.
i throat-rip.
yes you did.
except excrement.
ok, everyone.
let me get that for you.
listen, michael - about what happened earlier.
no.
love you.
i mean, our courtship can proceed?
the cop takes me away and tells me that I have been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall.
hey, you know what is even cooler than triceratops?
do you need anything?
mostly creeps.
wha- jim.
queen's higher.
all i had to do was look at the prices, idiots!
um.
i work with that guy.
...and the kind of discounts we are talking about are not... hold on - michael, why do you keep looking at the front door?
open the door!
spiderman, peter parker, would not reveal his love for mary jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the green goblin.
there is an employee named jim halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay?
trees!
okay.
but... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy.
it really is.
fine.
ugh!
what kind of mortgage did you get?
go back to the monkey!
and their king bee.
you just said it.
read the official kitchen regulations memo.
woman.
all right, I will help you.
have a seat.
it is for milking.
do i regret this?
I am trying to get your back.
better luck next year.
i was just showing her my belt.
oh, what a beautiful child.
i need people who are loyal.
oh, um... jan wants you to call her.
of course.
so, what am i supposed to do?
i might want lunch.
you think jim's lying?
okay, michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
hey, you wanted to see me?
have i not been worthy of your trust?
jo...  it is me.
no need to panic.
well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
...oh my god.
my turn, my turn.
where?
he sometimes wears glasses, write that down.
i just made another huge sale for the company that you manage.
pam, I am obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
i can not believe you came.
okay, everyone, listen up!
yes, i was quilled.
that is fantastic because I have always felt that the security here sucked .
today is ryan's first sales call and i am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
i do not care.
yeah.
mm-hm.
in an ideal world, i would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
this year i decided to really get into the spirit of halloween.
look  i gave him a six foot extension cord so he can not chase us.
i do not even want to tell you what it is made of until after you try it.
he says thank you.
if you do not hear from me by lunch, call me.
no because their sign is centered perfectly above their store.
they should not be in that room.
i just want to say for the record, i did not kill anyone.
then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
no kidding.
my cervix is ripening.
cut.
we want our clients back or we quit, michael.
it is a feral barn cat.
you calm down!
call the cops!
okay, a little about me.
no queen either.
"abdomen.
okay, okay.
last i checked, that is not an office building in the andromeda galaxy.
she had a hysterectomy.
okay, okay.
attention everyone!
oh no, no, no.
things were not this bad when just michael was manager.
please.
yep.
government-created killer nanorobot infection.
humans are terrible for the environment.
not so weak, huh, mom?
from quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent.
do they like him?
maybe use them.
from a late delivery to an accounting error.
if i were buying my coffin, i would get one with thicker walls so you could not hear the other dead people.
in addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of schrute farms, i can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications.
you did this for me?
oh god.
i can not do it again for a whole new guy.
she leaves the handcuffs on.
after that, we have a difficult conversation.
then burn the list.
it is not fine.
how could it be more clear?
thank you angela.
get the hell out of here.
i might see a movie.
bring it on.
I am here!
exactly.
i did not...  i did not think you needed them for this part.
now to your right.
how is the new boss?
you were bought out.
i walk a lonely road, the only one that i have ever known.
what?
ow!
you have to eat it!
or do i have to?
you are leaving?
you can not tantalize me.
the building?
would you like a tour?
I am a woman.
i have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern pennsylvania.
move to the side of the road!
andy approved it.
yes.
the dundies!
when he gets a good hand, he coughs.
good.
well, it is a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
fire him!
those are show bales, not play bales.
this is me and my family celebrating pennsylvania dutch christmas in 1982 on the farm.
oscar, $14.75.
no.
have you seen her painting, jim?
I have got a madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named andy bernard sold his xterra to a smart and capable man named dwight.
alright?
sure.
right.
i was once an enormous monster baby.
what the?
dwight's question, figure out who is the vp?' dwight, vp.
can i be your representative?
yeah, but that does not matter, you could get a brain aneurysm- or get hit by a car- or a bus or a train.
this -- uh, what?
i want to put the top down.
he is a traitor!
um...  oh, ryan, you are so smart.
what did you get?
people underestimate the power of nostalgia.
i mean, why would i want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf.
thank you.
i know what you guys are all thinking right now: hey, let us go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what?
very close.
hey monkey.
you live by the courthouse.
come on!
that is so juvenile!
thirty years later, i get a postcard.
gettysburg?
I am getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there is a mini-reunion.
huh?
there is broken glass everywhere.
hm.
okay?
oh, not likely.
creed.
so tender.
i hired him back after creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired.
wait, wait a minute, what is this, i did not order this?
you have earned one schrute buck.
no, no, hear me out.
it is dehydration.
phyllis vance, ladies and gentlemen!
my cousin mose's best friend was a dog.
yeah.
thank you.
they are total failures.
hey shut up.
cocks in the henhouse.
you never drink grape soda.
i do not look worried.
"kelly kapoor spent april 1995 to december 1996 at berks county youth center." juvie.
i think i would have been good at choosing the person.
do not do business with him!
it seemed kind of random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
god.
like hell you are.
mmm... hello tiny one.
he could have grown anything.
i know right... what the?
deangelo, tell your who are to leave me alone.
ooh does edgar allan poe know about that one?
i just might be his father.
jesus.
not for me, for my children.
i insist.
not that guy who murdered his mother.
i need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
no, that is unacceptable.
oh, yeah.
I will go tell andy the good news.
well, we have been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing i know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
i can drive a taxi.
i thought i got rid of you?
ok, that is great.
mm, great cake.
oh, pam, pam... what?
ah, my skin, ow, ow!
no!
you either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.
we need a new plague.
but he is unavailable.
yes.
there is a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
come on, let us go.
how strange.
what is this?
some cocoa?
sure.
try again!
i have to put you on with my boss.
you did?
oh, I have got stuff on her.
master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater scranton area paper market.
smeagol was corrupted and became gollum.
right, that is good, good, pursue this.
oh, i feel for you.
he is a homosexual.
do not do anything rash!
we like her better that way!
let us single... single... ok. buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
i still hear it.
some sort of virus?
i knew it!
he is a goner.
okay.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
do not hit the fence.
it does in the state of pennsylvania.
in fact, i feel like part of what I am getting paid for here is my loyalty.
hey!
just kidding.
big deal.
i am not a security threat... and my middle name is 'kurt', not 'fart'.
stanley, as you know, is retiring.
you forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you are locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
of course you found him not guilty.
not what i asked.
her family admires me, my family tolerates hers.
I am just an extraordinary piece of crap.
if i guess, will you tell me?
ok?
it is the safest part of the car.
i mean, it makes the battle of gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush.
no sense going down with a losing regime.
today is about herpes.
congratulations.
if i could menstruate, i would not have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore.
yes.
what are you talking about?
so you better tell me.
do not let-shh!
400 and one penny.
come on, let us go.
you are entering the "no spin zone!" not!
what?
c'mon darryl.
uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
oh god, that is a terrible idea.
sales is not all in here.
i am not.
I am not.
i mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs do not vibrate at all.
get rid of it.
except, you know what?
yes, i would.
hellboy's a hero.
exercise is good for depression.
okay, that is so mean!
yeah, it is all him and michael talk about anymore.
i guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss.
somebody is found the hog maw.
ok apparently there is a famous hollywood movie from the 1980's, beautiful girl... apparently, it is one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... that can not be right.
yes!
that you look like the world's tallest hobbit.
andrew bernard, that is my name.
wait, that is it?
i roped it off.
keep moving please.
brrring.
do not leave us!
I will never outsell jim and pam without one.
that is right.
she was, however, the closest thing i had to a mother.
pathetic.
what?
michael, please.
but if you are ever in the area, you will always have a place to stay...in my barn.
I am guessing he is some kind of close romantic friend.
so, yeah, I am in pain.
all that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
okay, i have served you loyally for years.
god!
thank you very much!
i mean, i could try destroying the pumpkin... jim, no.
what is the argument here?
yes.
cornell is a good school, and i want to better myself through higher education.
what he is trying to say is, gabba.
ok. you tell  them.
the eyes are the groin of the head.
hey, what is so funny over here?
i got nothing to hide.
everyone thinks the new guys are so cool because they can slack line.
oh, i assume I am going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
now, hold your bowls forward.
ha!
dear god, do not quit your day job.
hey, hey, hey, hey.
come on!
mose or the real mose?
"hey pam, let us buy expensive bathrobes and hug." i think we will be fine.
ok, i am going to tell michael and this entire office will be punished!
twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I will have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you will be sitting there like an idiot.
almost there.
all right.
but you have defeated yourself.
they are mean, but they are incisive.
i know that I am an adult, but maybe i could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.
that name brand place?
i wash my hands of this.
come on!
what do you think?
yes, exactly!
... is there any news on the leads?
michael, do not do this.
on behalf of jim and i, merry christmas.
hey hey hey hey.
you know who the vandal is.
yeah!
did they say what caused it?
you snubbed her.
i can not impregnate you, and that is the driving force between male-female attraction.
by evaluating their interviewers.
and it is a dying business.
wait wait wait wait, bedbugs?
oh, yes!
do not leave us, help us, we need help jim!
you would be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out... yeah.
i have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it.
I would love to invest.
jim, how dare you.
my warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
watch this.
apparently, they got attached to the duck and did not want to see it killed.
but your face does look like the guy from operation.
hey david, I am back.
five minutes exactly.
this is how i breathe.
jim and i, on behalf of- -the party planning committee... but effective, look!
smart.
i started a fire with my cheese pita.
okay, hey, hey, hey... did not think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, jim?
spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.
they are only one of staples' top competitors in the area.
do you even know anything about paper?
what are you talking about?
what are you mumbling about?
way to go.
you are a secretary!
okay.
thank you.
at that time, i will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as... whoa.
unbelievable.
no judge is going to believe that... okay people,  listen up, i have an announcement to make, fraud was committed... I am... i was making it.
you did get the e-vite to my barbeque!
eh.
i am ready for my performance review.
oh, he is sure.
by any means necessary?
yes!
okay.
angela?
and circle gets the square.
you have the right to remain silent.
sign it.
gay.
okay.
we should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
wow!
on-time delivery is the soil!
location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities... okay.
schrute farms, guten tag.
what?
yah!
you are barely alive.
present yourself.
why do not you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me.
hmmm?
ow, ow, ow.
come in.
can you nudge it with your finger?
hot-dog fingers.
michael.
that is right jim.
we are not allowed to use the baler.
joe mccarthy, richard nixon, studebaker, television, north korea, south korea, marilyn monroe, ryan started the fire!
michael!?
american idol?
here we go.
you are telling me, david wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
and we have begun.
i know what jim is trying to do.
oscar?
tokyo?
mmm, cookies.
I am sorry.
you know what?
but... hey, cece's toothbrush.
i can not run.
fictional.
it was gruesome.
took me years to figure out that it was a con.
but if frodo had not destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
