i did.
how about scrantonstrangler666.
ok, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk do not have the stomach to do.
hi, i am dwight schrute, mr. scott's associate.

nothing.
has no one here heard of kerrigan, from starcraft?
complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles.
they are going to be hard, they are going to be dirty.
visual aids.

maybe over a beer after she is closed her first sale .
<i>alien</i>.
I will make sure to write you a glowing reference.
you can not rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.

thank you very much.
listen, i may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.
well, shall we begin?
okay.
in your office?
embezzle.
you are fired!
stop playing games with me, crawdad.
i saw a picture in newsweek.
haha, mrs. schrute.
well, the alert was already set to "red" because of stairmageddon.
in fact, there are many knots that i cannot untie.
you are angry, and we are going to hear you out, all right?
let us do it!
you are right.
damnit!
hmm?
over the line, jim.
but I am not worried.
life lesson?
angela can stay the same, but we will change andy to dwight.

it is not going to take her 10 minutes to fax it, jim.
oh, also, sign them.

...I will consider it.
to a child's imagination that is mr. fork and lieutenant knife and... ms. fork.
it is my idea.
uggggh!
ok. if you make me head of sales one more time, i swear.
ok, no.
on my go... now!
ha-ha!
you know what?
his name's andy.
nothing.
you might remember testing my urine a few years back when i was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
that is not true.
warrantees do not cover it, plus they are a rip-off.
he comes over and you are like 'hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he is like 'uh!
i guess it does make sense buying from a father son team.
hello again, naughty nostrils.
sorry, mr. buttlicker.
great.
ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, michael gary scott.
because I am here for one thing.
i cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
jim talked too much.

i got sofa.
garbage can be very helpful.
that is a realistic time line.
come on!

yes.
i know.
so, you- and, well, i do not see my co-workers- hee-heeding this right now.
ok you know what, you can be a witness.
as long as it is downhill from the well, we should be fine.
you are a god.
we are looking for a man.
i am making a citizen's arrest.
you will now wrestle my cousin mose.
hammacher schlemer is still considering it.
please sir!
ok. the reason that i got bad customer reviews is because i did not!
you need to calm down.
ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year.
I have got way more friends than that, and they are all better than the losers who work here.
but you work tomorrow.
the coffee in paraguay is far hotter?
all their top clients i can not believe it.
you are talking about me in morse code.
put it in.
if i get the deicing gig, it is not going to be on merit.
i will let harm befall him.
false!
congratulations, ryan.
jim!
no, toby!
guns n' roses.
i wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in england.
one home run and you are out.
ok?
mm.
i do not have $30,000 lying around.
just- jim, could you fetch me some ice chips?
shh.
well, that question is meaningless.
you want rabies?
the way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again.
would you like to have a vacation this year?
have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
why would the architect design stairs this wide?
nope.
i think i should be on the team.
dwight schrute.
so i called my buddy down at the station today.

these are english... uh... letters.
once i brought in a duck.
we could tell him that his mother is dying.
i will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!

I am writing something.

i knew it right away.
ding dong.
it is goldenface.
low.
all in favor of purebred.
you mean, like a ham?

hmm.
touch the handle.
he is like a manatee.
my actual mother was very cold and distant.
sorry, go ahead.
there is plenty.
we have more houses to visit.
uh huh.
do you want to die?
those can not be my scores, jim.
that i wrote especially for this occasion when i was up there among the flames.
will not open it.
i am here for my bride!
you are going to watch me right?
mr. schofield, please?
you have to.
if i had been jfk, i would have seen all three gunmen.
it knows what you did!
because you guys are so... so important... to me.
why is he here?
get in the back.
i just got out of surgery.
do not sympathize.
and he is leaving a trail of poops?
do not throw it!
for a year!
sorry to interrupt.
I have got some photos.
i will locate the wedding crashers and report them to phyllis.
final question, young ryan howard.
louder!
that is because you are a preppy freak, you are the office pariah, and nobody likes you.
mose, hey, it is dwight.
very well.
ok, i have collected the rest of the ladies.
how are you going to do that?
they are making me out to be a bond villian.
oh, god.
why do not you introduce me to your little friend?
irrelevant question.
okay, I will talk.
let us just forget it.
false alarm.
no!
he does not like it.
nothing.
yup?
hi there.
that is an amusing link.
and his southern italian heritage raises some flags.
stop it.
it starred an african-american and ethan hawke.

i can not stand the fact that jeb is a pot farmer.
what are you worried about?
what?
give me the phone.
i can not wait to do to pam, what i just did... to pam.
and I am going to bring my gym bag just in case.
i do not understand why michael is wasting his time with spanish.
do not you want to know your present?

i know.
you know what?
yeah!
uh, better ask jim.
same thing.
... hello in there?

first thing, we are going to stretch the pelvic bowl.
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
all right.
which one is it?
okay, you are done.
no you did not, phyllis.
I am sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, mose, but she is your aunt too.
ingredients.
i thought you were going to parcel those out through the day there is still one thing we could do to get toby fired.
a towel?
senator lipton, welcome.
okay.
no, my groin... ...is really tight.
they have some great kitchen ideas.
give it to me.
you could ask for an extension.
oh... no... really?
everybody's going to be fine in exactly what they are wearing, let us go!
hm.
oh, man.
toby... ooohhh...   oh man!
but you are the one who picked today.
to understand me, you have to know that i work in the city, but i live here on this small, beautiful farm.
oh, yes, i did.
let us take him-- let us go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
come on.
I am rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
no other animal on earth could do this.

i imagine one of the best things about being an it guy is, you get to know everyone is computer passwords.
i just could not picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
she is younger than angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field.
oh, I am equipped... i can... do not tell michael... punishment fits the crime, i accept.
no, no, no.
what else?
yeah, no.
a very special room.
no.
attention in the office, please.
uh, okay.
how?
that is preposterous.
come here.
slytherin are the bad guys, jim.
amazing.
here we go.
go dent his hood.
so what do you need me to do?
i see what you are doing.
you wanted to see me?
uh, could you repeat that?
jim will not sign my expense report.
after i write you up for insubordination.
hmm.
jim!
oh no, I am sorry, no king beds.
hey pam.
jim!
yes!
as I am taking it down, a woman catches me.
the buyer is your sister's friend.
can you dump it on a woman?
you know that extra bedroom?
this has been a test of our emergency preparedness.
"intercourse to completion.
I have been attacked!
i figured it would save time.
been there, done that.
oscar.
yes, exactly.
do you?
you can do it at home by yourself with your finger.
oh, that is perfect!
I am screaming, I am screaming, I am screaming!
apache persuasion hold, that is the hell!
all that is left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward.
why would i put a banana in my holster?
you know what?
i need you to promise me that you will be on your best behavior.
it will be nice to see everyone again.
what kind of mileage does this baby get?
thank you, mr. schofield, for your time.
no, it is marijuana.
bring it in!
i am not a hero.
hey, this is none of your business.
i have no choice but to pick the hay king myself.
michael.
and our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...kevin.
i respond to strong leadership.
you need to start over.
like this?
ahh!!
ali had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
some tasks are not worth doing.
i think it was creed.
salesman is king.
no, no, no, no, no, it is not me.
it was playful hazing.
no, mose is fine.
come on.
hey david.
yeah.
michael!
no.
no sign of lan jevinson.
we made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
oh, my god.
i am a farmer angela.
he even looks like a mole.
of course i seesaw.
no.
it is just jim and i did not get along, and i did not want it to be that way again.
let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...?
you do a hundred jumping jacks.
i like where you are going with this.
what about you and your fake task?
here is a door.
well, jim, i just want to say that we have not always got along and at times, I have even hated your guts.
formal.
pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
just act natural.
ugh, god.
plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
not a gun.
uh, i want to congratulate the happy couple.
for five years I have held my instincts in check because i wanted to be made manager.
i have an acute ability to read people.
we will dig a trench.
[slams phone down[ i cannot believe you lost that account.
oh, that sounds awesome.
second only to the neck.
damn rooster did not crow.
oink the pigs, that is very important.
wait, who is dwigt?
okay.

or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
that is okay.
no.
filled with foresight.
yeah, you know me.
i got it, i got it.
describe it.
which was recently discovered to be a front for the taliban.
jump.
you are not jim.
why do not you just get rid of this guy?
look what the cat dragged in from stamford.
we are often compared to the guardian angels, but we could not be more different from them.

ok, now.
aEUR ahhmmmaEUR  excuse meaEUR  what?!
one more.

line up, throats together.
I am good.
no!
yeah.
hey.
okay.
ok, i apologize for yelling at you.
yes.
it is not important how i got your information.
because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
nine and three-quarters.
no!
so we at sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
five times.
hey, who makes this chair?
yeah.
and this desk.
what a surprise!
you look good in this.
that is too much peanut butter.
wow.
to give you a reference point.
yeah we weigh about the same, would not you say?
it is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?!
okay?

fire jim.
a lightbulb.
you are back.
can i say "good month?" copy.
and how better than by signing a contract?
women look like white slaves.
yours does not.
what is going on?
jim, for instance, has a huge tell.
i know.
no, seriously.
no, michael, stop it!
you know experiencing freedom.
a carp is both a fish and a term for complaing.
besides, i think jim would be a fine manager.
turns out, he had only eaten one of mose's cream pies.
yes, it is.
michael scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
ugh!
um.
let us do this thing.
that should motivate you to keep your eyes open.
you are an idiot.
how as being a minority affected you?
i got sofa.
did you get anything good?
we have a colleague with the same name.
do not listen to him.
enjoy.
all I have ever wanted was to be manager here.
i do not know.
i knew it.
you staying with michael?
man, what is taking toby so long?
i do not believe you.
i can do this on my own.
well, i can make this work.
wait for this to constrict.
ghaaa!
i have to run to my car to take a dump.
no preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
angela.
i know you are innocent, but i can not look like I am treating you any differently.
go ahead.
i can protect you from kelly.
hut!
what do you think you are doing?
i may have a little solution to our mistakes problem.
because!
yes.
does he own a gun?
if i see her, my heart will explode.
they are unrelated.
no, no.
that was not so hard now was it?
i knew it.
i just need to tell them.
you are thinking of a chicken.
"some say the only failure there is is the failure to try."  that is wrong.
hold your breath.
wow... i figured out your goal.
you have got to tell andy about us.
ok, I will punch you.
you have got a knot in your crest.
and by the way, uh, i told her not to, but she is coming over here and she is furious.
i have to do something to his eyes.
do not you think i know that?
okay, great.
i am.
$30,000?
my greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ... i can not get it out.
i believe his tissue has made me stronger.
it is in a blind spot because I am trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you.
net.
then you are an idiot.
your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
psssh, no.
what happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
michael, listen.
michael, i cannot tell you what i was doing there.
do you understand what we are about to do?
i have been given the responsibility to manage stanley, a solid player, ryan, who is capable of surprises, erin, an excellent follower and kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma.
not because i want to.
oh, i hate to break it to you, abby.
that is how you deal with a thief.
do you even know what this is?

nooo!
we usually marry standing in our own graves.
oh.

i once hit three home runs against little flower catholic.
yes, sorry too late.

i have to go to the hospital.
come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
now I am going to ask you just a few simple questions.
what do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
ah, I am not interested.
it is just grossly irresponsible.
and yet he is my friend.
I am sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
why do they call him the bus?
looks like someone decided to dress up as old dwight schrute's mom.
she was stoned apparently.
okay scram, wizard.
or lemonade and strychnine.
i just need andy to think it is his idea.
come on!
ok everyone,  back to work.
what is the exact square footage.
jim halpert.

michael is your superior.
hey there.
aEUR  lit the whole thing on fire.

you can not do that.
I am sure he had his reasons.
word.
I am going to pass you off to my supervisor.
they are testing it now.
angela, it is simple.
aEUR  nellie, wait.
it is not the greatest one either... and it is clear we are not going to carry them.
that does not make any sense.
uh, duh.
chicken fight!
yeah and then they make you drive them to church the next morning.
there is plenty of pyramids.
okay, i will.
welcome to schrute farm.
ha ha.
really?
no, it was not.

on the contrary, I am helping cornell.
huh, angela?
oh, my god.
lonely people mixing with one another?
let us go!
hey.
no, no, no.
anything else you need to talk about?
ugh, it is almost too easy.
she was a prostitute.
it would be my pleasure, mr. schrute.
meh.
the last supper.
i have.
you know there is a ghost in this office a woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. haddie mcgonagle.
had conversation with michael about taking credit for an idea that was not mine.
and just to be clear, there is a second definition, "perfect pork anus" which i do not mean.
take those home to your wife.
i love you!
he stretched his pelvic bowl!
so?

so what I am hearing you say is, "make stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible"?
move, move, move, move, move.
trust me, stanley,  you are going to want to read this memo very carefully.
wait, what you doing?
out of the way!
owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant.
i know none of that.
there you go.
how many of you have seen the documentary deliverance?
jackie chan!
i also made plans to ask jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  time to get to work .
just a ride home?
k, I am going to need some help.
what do you mean?
let me tell you why i should be the next manager with a riddle: a manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant.
attention, everyone.
but that is a risk we have to take.
yes, i did, 'cept i do not think she means it.
we could have integrated more chuck into the presentation.
never.
no!
are you going to discipline him or not?
yes.
rule 17: do not turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season.
okay.
what does that mean?
jim, you owe me $14.75.
we have got smoke!
yeah!
cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing.
you should be the motivational speaker.
really?
you should know that.
no!
jim, right here, right here.
wait.
do not break up you guys, you are great together.
i see you are begging for mercy, huh?
the liar will perspire.
whenever I am about to do something, i think, "would an idiot do that?" and if they would, i do not do that thing.
right dwight, right dwight.
ok, you suck at this.
robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet.
i miss her so much.
dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
and then we will destroy the man himself.
oh.
world war ii veteran.
oh, so glad i could help.
once I am officially regional manager my first order of business will be to demote jim halpert.
like you and your son.
but i will never let him lose his dignity.
let us go again.
please, i can double your pace.
smile and nod.
were you raised in a household with no consequences?
i just need some alone time.
dwight k. schrute" please.
okay, good.
to my chickens I am the scranton strangler.
okay, hold on for a second, folks.
what is the matter with... me?
tell me where it hurts.
give me the hose!
straight up.
oh, hey.
what do you think?
you want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra.
tell you what.
I will drive.
no women or children.
you are no tracker.
this gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
what?
yeah.
here is a little tip for your performance review.
so i will cede her to you.
oh, dear god in heaven.
try influenza.
were you absent?
it just does not add up.
well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but i do not see them so i think we are good.
that is like calling a policeman a cop.
it was me against raj patel.
</p> yes i do.
he has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder.
it is close.
men find me desirable.
they are howling at the moon.
are you near sighted or far sighted?
what is your win rate?
well done.
also, i want it to have a florida feel.
then why is there new wood only on one railing?
oh yeah?
great idea!
ahh!
uh, employer, dunder mifflin paper incorporated.
but david, listen to me carefully.
you are bad.
when is the paleolithic age?
so, temp... you seem to be pretty close to this oscar.
i saved this company money.
spit that out.
hey michael?
where is the certification number, halpert?
stop asking me hypothetical questions, ok?
dunder-mifflin, the farm, mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror.
nothing to be alarmed about.
you like that?
you look like you are getting a good workout.
clear out, stat!
and the talent agent says, "describe your act." and the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "what do you call yourselves?" and the man says, "the aristocrats!" i mean truly repulsive acts.
she claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
and to think, i always thought of her as a second meredith.
i can not... this is why I am a volunteer sheriff's deputy and you are not.
that is what I am saying!
there is a photo... these are cautionary tales for kids, my grandmata used to read these-- nazi was a fascist movement... ...from the 1930's... i was going to teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
I have got a solution.
i know, because you have no role models.
jeez!
you will say 'yes' on one.
yes.
you heard me right.
who is side is toby on?
no, jim.
do you have anything for that?
i will now perform my final kata forms.
i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
shhh.
ok. you know what?
like all human beings?
boo, unimpressed.
five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one.
temp!
let me get that door for you- there you go!
it is up to you to choose which you want to be.
how did that get there?
could be the mob.
of course i wanted jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.
what was the point of spilling the drink on me?
oh, better than ok.  you know what honey?
wrong.
what else does it look like?
right.
pam.
well, i do not have a lot of choices.
thank you, thank you very much.
oh, you do not say.
i have it buried very deeply, and i do not want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
one thing about me, i am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
thank you, michael.
you have reached the voice mail of dwight kurt schrute.
ha ha!
steak.
yeah!
hi.
today is the test launch day for the inaugural sabre store.
psh, why is that great?
i just do not know what we would do.
look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon.
pssh.
there you are.
with snowballs, jim?
can i drive?
what are you looking at?
that is how you really apply the pressure.
pam and karen.
what?
oh!
yes i can.
entirely is the perfect way to describe it, iris.
it is also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.
go tell her we are here.
excuse me.
blah.
come on, coward!
let us just knock this out right now.
do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
less blood clots.
very smart.
i like to think of it as a kids place.
i know how to build a business.
oh jim, I am not going to quit.
i got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
whoa, whoa, whoa.
no, no, no, no!
i know that is what he said.
him.
please, I will make you proud.
wow.
wait, it is that easy?
that is two things.
jim was lying about jury duty.
he just was mirroring.
that sounds promising.
you will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
it is the ladies' room.
whatever you want.
i stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
is there a place closer that sells them?
i tried being rational, ok?
you are screwed!
ready... go!
oh, this is your cell, i thought this was your... michael.
ok, pam, thanks.
and of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the kaiser thing.
good morning.
okay!
well, you can kind of tell from the voice.
where are my leads?
next slide.
we both know why I am here: to see... you... naked... while... I am... naked.
cute kids, thanks for coming.
attention!
i have yet another sales order for you to sign.
we have three rooms, each with a different theme.
what?
so, I am paying full price?
and if we have to defend ourselves, i will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
they are extraordinary.
now, go make your hands rough with work.
comparisons are hard.
you are stinky.
hey, did you sms text message me?
i just want to know what is written about michael.
take a seat down there.
boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus.
unless we are unplugged.
i was thinking of proposing to esther today.
andy.
what?
I am just scaring him.
what is wrong?
we make love all night.
break protocol!
so, all the numbers adding up?
I am hungry.
gentlemen.
shh!
i need to see if they are dilated.
this is a home, and i would much rather see a smile from kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity.
you can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
excuse me.
hmm?
and now, by show of applause, we will crown this year's hay king.
come here you.
i bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.
why would you choose me?
no.
this is our duty - to change their perception.
got it.
how is it fair to them?!
nothing is going on.
and they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse i would try a cheetah.
I am guessing he is some kind of friend.
done.
aah!
all because i had lice when i was 7. make way, nope, inspect me.
I am a little busy.
plus, I have got a secret weapon.
the hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat  is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
makes me rethink having skin at all.
you get any news about the leads, you try me.
adam's apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla.
let us be honest.
the scranton zoning board has a strong bias against beet farmers.
okay.
whassup.
got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
but i get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .. .. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so.
and your affiliation with cornell - will end completely!
i know you did it!
knew it!
now is the time for action.
it is so much closer to the bathroom, right?
I am going to count down from ten.
i will stay here and run things on this end.
me too, get in the car.
jim, I have given you this information, like, twenty times.
hello.
there is an emergency in the warehouse.
oscar... okay, that is <i>not</i> an eight foot sub.
hey!
movie idea?
I would be happy to see jim as manager.
you are finally going to get to go out and flap your wings.
does not apply.
i was saying that before.
glowingly negative.
uh-huh.
nellie let me bobble-ize him.
or none of you i wish i could hire all of you.
listen.
I am ravenous after a night of love making.
comfortable.
every day is black tie optional!
why do not you bring by your little angel?
oh d. oh d. we had already applauded.
excuse me.
negative!
how long did it take you and pam to conceive?
huh, huh, huh!
oh god; were you guys making out?
just slip it off my--slip it off my hips.
but i promise I will never betray you again.
what?
no footprints.
...so good.
yeah!
the pressure!
no, no.
that is a bit extreme.
we would go in pretending to be family - brothers.
the bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
okay, everybody listen up!
nice to see you.
do you have the sharpie?!
oh, man!
i love pain.
ha!
with the electricity we are using to keep meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days.
he was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
think guardian angels.
it is not in the contract.
yeah... what is wrong with you?
fire department was here.
smileaEUR nod.
thank you.
none of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay?
someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
this cleaver appears to need sharpening.
he is going to ask andy to produce a ring.
in my contract, it is stipulated that i provide a temporary work space.
if michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
this must be some kind of mistake.
not only the years we have been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered.
get outta here.
well, that is all baltzer gladfielder had and no one eats owls for thanksgiving.
no... that can not be it.
it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
but this  seems to be... i know how.
birthday time is over!
neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity.
we must never acquiesce for it is together, together, that we prevail!
you know, i feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
no need we can just check the security tapes.
i have crossbows.
has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
when han solo returns to the death star in the millennium falcon, and shoots down the tie fighters and saves the rebel because, do you think he does so for a free beer?
yes.
a great opportunity squandered?
oh pam.
let us see.
okay that is- that is good, let us wrap it up.
it is all yours.
this is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will.
what do you think you are doing?
i am a sith lord.
your old condo closing papers.
let me guess- you ate the bagel i gave you and loved it.
i go down to the police station on my lunch break.
okay, yeah, i know what to do.
this is not going to work out.
what?
you know, see if we can catch this pervert.
you are out of order.
fine, i chose the global relief foundation.
my grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm.
yes!
ok, no, they do not understand who they have... you are interrupting me.
no, no, not michael.
just for fun?
seal the deal.
bloggers are gross.
and totally against the spirit of christmas.
what i did find, was mold, and lots of it.
ow, ow, ow, ow.
with fluffy little snowballs?
that is not true.
point it towards the store, idiot!
it is called "schrute or consequences." you are going to choose one of these two things.
reams.
lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
soccer practice.
dwight schrute.
move, move, move, move!
can you not?
cops can not do anything until a crime has been reported.
just a little announcement folks, remember, the dundies is a black tie affair.
standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler.
no, like you.
I am serious.
ah!
just stripped of its pomp and frills.
not a wizard, a hobbit.
thank you.
i was born a man, halpert.
budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is going to be a fight to the death.
kelly kapour.
ok, you have got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
so.
okay?
apparently, in business school, they do not teach you how to operate a toaster oven.
truth be told, i never thought that this was how it was going to end.
we are complete strangers.
that is the most idiotic thing i have ever heard in my life!
amish.
does anyone want to split a twice baked potato?
rule violation.
not yet.
has anyone checked how dilated she is?
fine.
breathing.
you will not regret this decision, david.
on an innocent baby.
so sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we are at corporate.
okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j jim halpert and i will fax it in to you... under you.
go ahead.
what a waste of a day.
i want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym!
this is humongous.
this'll be much harder.
just lice pam?
and you must be uh, from the washington post.
no.
I have been raising children since i was a baby.
like you would ever be cold, kevin.
a prank, huh?
kathy.
cancel all of your business with the steamtown mall!
uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
jo is coming later today.
pam.
jim, turn around.
i am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well.
what?

i need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
pam.
so... best to just lay off.
142 south windsor lane.

why are you looking at my forehead?
well, i did it too.
i date indian girls.
no, no, no, i was here first.
he is ti-- there is no way that that was-- ok. none of your business.
you... oh!
for instance, the time i brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
and then you have to tame it.
here we go.
does it have a deck?
well, well, well.
if a vampire bat was in the you.s., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." like penn-sylvania.
I am on it.
i bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
may i?
the holster was a gift from my great-uncle honk.
yes!
and he is gasping, he is panting!
come on.

i hope you have been paying your wig storage bills jimbo, because it is time for another episode of "handsome and stinky, paper brothers for hire".

if i wanted to see a pissing contest, I would lock mose in the chicken coop.
what did they do to you, angela?
establish time frames.
okay?
oh, it is happening.
it is a cemetery.
you know, that way i can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate... well i just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all... andy I am really sorry about your mother.
it is good to be paranoid.
cri-man-squa?

michael ... oh... poor little fella.
I am totally going to win us that box set.
high fives!
I am sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
yes, you did.
but i got some disappointing medical news.
have you ever seen a burn victim?
relax, ok. and because this is christmas, i am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing.
that is right.
good?
i can deliver food.
i break into tiffany's at midnight.
he used to fight dogs.
listen, uh may i speak with you... privately?
i did not really.
alyssa?
i should know.
we have never met each other.
i got a shirt guy.
ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait.
there is no way he has not strangled at least one stripper.
we advance to the next round!
oh temp, i like that.
opus dei.
let us get some raw meat on that face.
whatever it is that you are doing, and I will see you monday.
is this what you were looking for?
you have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things.
we have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together.
thank you.
there is an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down... there is a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down... ...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... you know, i really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers.
stupid.
is that the last year the data was available?
i can make more sales than a computer.
completely true.
can i just say- can i say something?
it is condescending.
have you heard of paper?
hold on michael!
well.
she had a hysterectomy.
no!
our hero!
so it is true?
i could teach you if you want.
bildenkinder.
this interview is over.
you have been granted level three security clearance.
we are good.
face each other.
and i know... i know what you are thinking.
in case michael or andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day.
in fact, he is lied about every question.
oh, our contract.
please, you must do one thing.
aww, j, p and d. the three amigos.
oh no... jan had the baby and michael was not there to mark it.
ahh.
where?
can i feel your pulse?
I will do it.
I am having some lady troubles.
do not throw it!
sales is about people, ryan.
get in the car.
but our, our elevator does not require a pa... have you been introduced to kevin?
oh yes!
and frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now i find very alarming.
in her prime, shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
I would prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
and you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home.
I am a schrute.
which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
tick- that is a clock!
but it is not for worms or eczema like any normal pill.
let us go.
you think i should set it to "double red"?
i am sorry.
not in a million, billion years.
you okay?
because it is in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
phillip, if you are hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I am dead.
yellow for cowardly.
you, you, you, you... who are you?
michael, once this gets out... i do not know how it is going to go down.
but, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers.
damn it!
are you kidding me?
sure!
besides i got to get back downstairs.
hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio.
this is not kelly kapoor story hour.
if the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that is where the nurse can live.
I have seen enough.
I am going to set your face on fire.
big smiles folks!
check.
okay, one.
go on.
okay, question.
uh huh.
the dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others.
we only have a few weeks left.

that will come out of the upholstery.
no, not me.
you know maybe sign- ok.  well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.
aaaaaaaa!
you did?
woo!
roll into the future with work bus.
oh, i bet you do.
but someone committed a crime and i did not become a lackawanna county volunteer sheriff's deputy to make friends.
fireball.
jim, come on.
drinks on me!
my resignation?
word.
where is holly?
there is a code embedded in the memo.
in america, in 2007. he said he knew the word ladder... what an ignoramous.
nothing left to do except dot the i's, the j's, and the umlauts.
listen, things are getting really bad down here.
oh, god!
yeah!
huh.
i can see that as a very real possibility.
why is he talking to holly?
i do kickboxing three times a week.
it is unnaturally sunken.
and you closed it.
you keep forgetting about him.
sales is really not so hard ok?
about what?
i did, however, tip my urologist, because... i am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
really?
ok, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers.
when i was young, i spent several years at a private school where i was told i would be taught to harness my mutant abilities.
ok!
let us do this thing.
can you hold it in your hand?
she sent an email, so.
huh?
we are going to miss you, gabe.
case in point, jfk.
how is that funny?
such a sweet guy.
no word from michael.
it is?
thought I would go casual today.
what makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview?
you know what; i bet she cracked it at home.
attention, everyone!
oh my god.
i dare you to produce one credible source about this.
okay, nap it is!
so i can lower it.
aaagh, aaagh!
fine.
what?
god!
you are so pathetic.
it is about phillip.
that is not true.
what is it?
we did it!
yeah.
you would have to fire him, right?
thank you, michael.
way to negotiate, idiot.
i will not let you down.
where is the clitoris?
are we idiots?
come on.
hey guys, ah i feel refreshed now.
watching?
your car breaks down.
we are back in.
it is a piece of paper.
hey i got this, okay?
you are trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee.
in the end, the greatest snowball is not a snowball at all.
ryan!
we should check the security tapes toby.
if we do not do this to prince paper, someone else will.
i will pay you whatever it takes.
who are you calling?
michael, i do not know... i can handle it.
keep it up, and you are looking at a written warning.
not.
no need to thank me.
michael always said, k.i.s.s.
easier to stop if it turns on us.
step lively!
oh hey, jim.
have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
but everything has a shelf-life.
just rock.
this has been a wonderful day.
you had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
i know what angela and the senator look like.
grunting is scientifically proven to add more power.
rolph, please.

jim...wha... come on!
you watch it!
donna, wait, please.
he -- please, mr. buttlicker -- please give me another chance.
hold me!
i do.
ok, tell him that is not true.
temp!
I am telling you, they are heartbreaking too.
we do not do anything until michael gives us further instructions.
they are mocking you with wordplay.
where is the heart?
yes i did.
extreme!
did you have another nightmare?
let... let me out.
I am telling the truth.
oh, my god.

and the rest was just stuff.
well, what am i thinking?

he was in the backseat.
what are you doing?
this cannot stand.
because if not, i just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
ahhh.
i had to send him home.
rendering him utterly and completely disabled.
i could beat that on a skateboard.
it is pure pleasure.
maybe.
um... ryan needs his number for the count off.
give me the dice!
yeah!
they do not.
michael is on vacation and he is asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
I have been so good... please.
stanley!
we work together.
people'd obey the law, there would be less troublemakers.
shall i play for you?
I am embarrassed.
what?
you are no doubt wondering why i have left this note.
ok!
pam, please call security!
well then you are not going to talk to the new building owner.
if you applied this to your regular work, you will not even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
okay.
la la la!
"seasonal." well, the christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical.
I have got a better angle on pam.
unless it was the president.
vice president, uh, who is that?
fire hazard.
how about, ah, lackawanna county.
but that is all behind us.
ha, ha, ha, ha.
you got to milk them, or else they will moo like crazy.
no, we have not ordered anything.
text back, "kind of." i do!
your heart is a wonderful thing, michael.
it is complicated.
you know, i may have underestimated you.
it is for the severance.
yeah!
a bottle capper?!
you see, it is on my periphery and if i needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow.
hi esther.
inside you will see many pelts.
you have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
not my urine.
eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity.
yes, maybe I am not.
jim tricked me into thinking I would won a walk-on part on ncis, but that is not important.
my grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
checks out.
doctor frankenstein, doctor jekyll, not them.
ryan!
back injuries are common.
fosters in the big can.
I am here!
the waitress tripped on the cord.
they are not for me.
excuse me.
I would love to take a look around.
was i too harsh?
what is your daughter's name again?
I am on it.
oh yeah!
no thanks I am stuffed.
what?
if there is any concrete news you will know as soon as possible.
i sure do.
well, yeah.
if it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
it is lumpy.
also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
i had two goals today.
the only possible assistant to my assistant- me.
I have moved on.
let me demonstrate.
you tell me what is unethical.
is everything okay?
i let pam win.
admit it, pam.
get it out.
jump up and down.
no, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, "i say, i say, i say, I will sit on you!" vamping.
you have been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
ordinarily i would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up.
words will never be enough.
really?
I will do whatever you say.
okay?
no, i was not asking you.
no!
come on.
man, how long have we been sitting here?
and you make sure to get down there and check out that harry potter world.
hey kids, was that fun?
care to celebrate with a drink?
better safe than sorry.
does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
i should know first.
mmm-hmm.
it is been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
what about when jan said the branch was closing?
i knew it.
chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
I will do anything, i swear.
gryffindor!
and when I am promoted, you will be full fired.
it is the most dominant.
did i just hear you laughing with glee?
no!
you have not even looked around yet.
alright.
yeah.
who is the father?
of course.
maybe i just feel bigger.
turns out he is a totally lovely guy.
if you walk out that door, so help me, i will -  he left.
if you agree, say nothing.
reduced him to a mere ant.
robert!
that usually works on him.
have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
then we meet at the denny's... ...and then we compare notes.
we could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they are out of the house.
i know.
i cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid.
i wanted to talk to you in private because i wanted to ask you out on a date.
coast guard?
all right?
a lion eats me and I am dead." well, I am not dead.
i left packer alone with nellie for way too long.
okay, fine.
absolutely everything was the same.
through concentration, i can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.

office depot!
it is him!
do not even care!
come on, break this up.
you had your chance.
you?
we looking for him.
but check that it is covered by your but the little cars go in the compact spot!
so uh,  meeting is over, i guess.
instead, today i will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
since then I have loved working with pam and she is frankly wonderful, but i hate her.
okay, what are you deciding?
any other questions?
i will not need to because we will be together playing hooky.
like, "oh good.
just tell me what the bathroom wall says.
delicious.
and in that chaos, i soared.
wow.
it allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal.
good thing it is not the discovery.
hey  you know who would like this?
i want to do this.
many schrutes were born here and many of us end up here.
whoa, whoa.
just drink a lot of water.
in the past year, i have consolidated the entire scranton paper market.
including the car phone!
mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
maybe we are the kind of guys who end up with a tractor that is already been rode hard and put away muddy.
thank you.
oh come on.
I am going to launch him.
hi, dwight.
well at least I am not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school.
what does this mean?
ok behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and i have chosen one of the best.
hey... why did you do it?
shopping.
no!
would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk?
it is not about mose.
inside the house.
joke's on you.
move it!
do not be mad, it is a business trip.
what is going on?

I am thinking about getting something german, something with decent gas mileage.
i have no compassion.
well, so do i.  and so does our secret benefactor.
i see how this movie ends.
strip club.
mother bites the cord.
do not worry, it is just a bull tranquilizer.
i know what you are trying to do, i do not want it.
it is not rabid.
yes.
that is not a statue, that is a robot.
great.
i played the part of mutey the mailman.
so... hey come on, do not be sad, just... ok... just.
there is got to be another way.
and you did not call jim - that seems significant.
everything is fine.
no.
arriba!
... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
and i mean that figuratively.
blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
and guess what, kids.
hell, yeah.
seal it off with drywall so you do not hear yo-yo ma over there all the time.
i train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.
my appendix- my wound has not healed yet.
acting manager.
no.
nice.
how ya feeling, better?
got a real special surprise for you.
wrong.
i was -- i was right.
showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates.
that is on my side.
yes.
so you will let me know when you have made a decis... this is called leveraging an offer.
i would simply send him a different piece each day.
she finally said yes.
this is going to be good.
hungry?

not dwight.
i do not think so.

okay i am the bait.
this is more professional.
i have to go to practice.
jan, may i introduce to you your own personal dunder mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction.
my new sensei, sensei billy, thought i had more than enough training to take the test.
as his right-hand man, it is my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
american, irrigation, and night-time.
eat it jim!
how can i help you?
i need to stay focused, and i do not have to see you tomorrow or sunday and please do not call me, and we will see how things go on monday.
ahh.
break's over!
so, uh tell me again the difference between filene's and filene's basement.
also, i can retract my penis up into itself.
come on!
enter sandman, metallica.
whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, i think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
really?
i will have seven first priorities.
let me see you jump.
anything could have been in there.
i appreciate this so much.
forgive my pants, they fell down.
it is howard gruber.
will never be her name.
okay, actually, there is time to explain.
get back... back to work!
shut up maggot!
uh, knock, please.
oh, why?
we shoulda brought andy.
okay.
yeah!
i always work out without my clothes.
who wrote this, hysterical one?
woo!
people, human lives, however, can... okay, let us go.
that is the third time and it was not funny the first two times either jim.
hey, where you would you like to go next?
knights of the night are volunteer crime patrollers.
then we will burn utica to the ground.
god, oh.
coolio.
I am the man for this job.
what are you going to do now?
yeah.
well, jerry, the one who got away.
and you burned over a thousand calories walking home.
what is the true because of robert mifflin's suicide?
ryan!
well, i knew it existed, and i chose to let it die.
yeah , are not we getting those clients back?
here is another good idea.
his father's name dwide schrude.
it is after 5:00, jim.
in the schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents.
come on.
are you trying to hurt my feeling?
okay.
i love women.
okay, i just... it is a sales call.
i had a pretty good day today.
it just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are going to singe your eyebrows.
break it down by keyword, okay?
that should not have been in there.
is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like jim was?
could kathy, darryl, phyllis, kevin and kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
we have been battling for a long time, but you know what?
and you are disgusting, dwigt.
you might want to get to the airport.
if it is hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
today marks several important milestones.
imagine... someone has a personal hero they really want to help.
can i have a gun?
my cousin mose told me a joke.
you are just filling that out right now.
ah!
every other dinosaur that ever existed.
.
lots of cultures eat rice, does not help me.
yeah.
when is the guest of honor coming?
continuing.
silence?
excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
have fun tonight!
okay, okay.
i say, bring it on.
and, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when i was born.
i am treating you the same as a man, for whom i would also not stand.
and if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his.
feast on this, lewis.
okay!
think it through.
i have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now.
if the soil starts to get acidic, you have probably gone too far.
okay.
hey, what was she like?
is somebody after you?
no, i mean at the gift shop.
really.
yes.
if anyone's having sex with nellie for personal gain, it is me, and I am not joking at all.
this is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die.
