what is the matter with you?
what are you going to do if you are by yourself and your heart stops?
what... i was aware that you were speaking.
you do not know that.
uh, well I am afraid not.
i think so.

i just want to know who did it so i can punish them.
no, do not say it.
you greedy little thing.
you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand.
for instance, pam's cousin, jocelyn webster.
what is diwali, you may ask?
what?
okay, jim, you are the number two in this office.
so, i forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this... one other thing i wanted to... ohh...nah.

dripping on me.
god, stanley, that is frickin' brilliant.
ok. anyone?
for this is my room.
i hate it.
we are going to... come here .
well, i know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did i...and the only reason i got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
maybe even one of angela's famous brownies.
it is a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
hey.
i cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid.
twenty-nine!
it can not be nothing.

angela said she was going to tell him.
I am serious.

it always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise.
I am sorry.

i had to do that.
look at him.
disarm!

otherwise, it is just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
let us just... play act.
welcome back, jerky jerk-face.

hey!
that is going to happen, you know.
can we afford to lose email forwards?
they were very important in the movie titanic.
dumatril.
but, i went to the ross, in trenton new jersey, and i found the exact same suit.
you are right.
jim, what do you say?
i would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to jan about what happened between us.
yeah, all the homies i have listened to that song so many times and i still do not know what opp stands for.
see?
you do not know who your daddy is, do you?

you can not do that, huh?
i am talking about convincing michael that the guy's not mafia!
okay.
what is love...  anyway?

i should punch him in the nose for what he is making me do to her.
oh, do you really have ears, phyllis?
it is in maryland.
trust me, stanley,  you are going to want to read this memo very carefully.
we are going to make a monster sale, that is what we are going to do.

i need her name if I am going to return her glove.
I am not saying... a damn thing.
because justice never rests.
toby... ooohhh...   oh man!

i do not know what the  that was.

cow surfing?
i do not get it.
hmmm... mmm... great turkey leg.
he talks about how gay oscar is... and that angela's a midget, and that  your chin is too big.

if i could menstruate, i would not have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore.
let us go!
nooo!

is not he terrible?
you are hurting him.
yeah, I am sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
well, i was just thinking that maybe i should keep a salami in my pocket... ...in order to feed the bears.
what is going on?
but i get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .. .. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so.
rich people love pizza.
throw in a concussion grenade.
you will fall in love with her.
be quiet.
dwight schrute for robert california!
how long did this take you?
but i do not have any... five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five... good morning, michael.
you just did not think of it first.
and then when you said you defintely did not want to have kids, who had it reversed back?
hey.
i know.
why are surveys important?
uh well, yeah of course.
it is insane!
oh you can not because i do not care.
who cares?
have you ever seen a burn victim?
come on.
nnnngah!
i only had an hour to put it together but I am going to add on to it later on.
for a year!
okay.
because the handicaps get a raw deal.
elizabeth, i want you to sit here.
they should not be in that room.
I am not kidnapping him, I am keeping him until i get what i want.
do not!
obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I am launching a full investigation.
really?
c'mon.
plus, I would be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
hey!
that person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail.
excellent!
pam?
or her husband.
sorry man.
yeah, it is only meredith, thank god.
why do not we watch that show that you have been wanting to watch, that stupid battleship galaxy.
you can use it.
have fun.
what is it?
it keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat.
carol?
oh, man, would i love to go head-to-head with him.
go.
where are we here?
jim.
give me the bottle!
oh, decided to sit down again, huh?
well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for pda here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best valentine's day present that a person could receive.
anything new on youtube?
to be burned!
what are you talking about?
nuhh... oh, ok. you are welcome.
come on, shooter!
what is up?
i did not say it, i declared it.
those are not deep fried, right?
dear god, do not quit your day job.
i deserve this.
500. get lost.
i need three, maybe two.
jim?!?
i thrive on it.
it is uh... two and a half.
please.
the gabba-gool.
it was gruesome.
I am going to have to cut this all out.
ok, where is everybody?
get out of here.
there is no belt above black.
... what, nerf is not cool anymore?
she was cute.
i would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
i think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
she would think of me as her friend.
i do not know.
i was born a man, halpert.
secret santa, let us go.
win over any man in my guild.
can you get it back?
like he is going to win anyway, right?
but... bye, bye.
oh, wait.
then i go to sleep.
that is not going to be our story.
hi, jan, it is michael.
um... walking out of the room unexpectedly.
it is diversity day, jim.
ok, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.
i know, but it is competitive here.
jan got fired.
i need to go over some details with you.
just going to... take a... brief pause at this point.
that is not constructive.
great.
and he is with a beard.
you stop me when i reach the diseased area.
that is why you are not on the team.
mr. bourchard.
so basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
and you will be hearing from the - -cornell application department, and you will not be pleased with the result.
i choose michael!
nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it?
everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I would like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes.
yeah, you love him right?
why would i have monkey problems?
so think about it.
no.
pleasure to meet you.
michael.
fun, right?
i do too.
please.
do you even know what this is?
yaaaaay.
they are caveman.
i did do it!
ok. so, let us dish.
uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme... yeah, i do not even know why i said booze cruise.
she had a hysterectomy.
then i contacted the authorities.
seriously.
really?
it was not easy.
it was not that much.
oh, i bet you do.
I will call her back.
they are happy down there in the furnace room.
after what you did?
this movie, portrait of a... prostitute something.
that is metallicy.
because I am drunk, i can not even find her.
you know what, i would not worry about angela.
the people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends.
oh hey!
this... you know this is a scale of one to ten?
so I will come get you before the table-making demonstration.
yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack.
welcome to the hotel hell.
i sure do.
you mad?
here we go.
carry on.
I am going to use sms text.
guy had no sense of humor about it.
hey.
hey!
oh man.
that is a train whistle, like I am the conductor.
and he actually hooked up with one of the students.
why do you hate her?
you are damn creative.
and i think for a small company that is really  someone went to the bathroom.
lifeline.
why are you sleeping that way?
but it is cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can not scrub worth a damn.
you did not know it was my birthday.
you got to keep yourself dehydrated.
ok, you know something, dwight?
without a safety net, people will improve.
nobody likes beets, dwight.
meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
you are just going to somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what is going to be on your tombstone?
oh... try not to be so hurtful jim.
that is not what wallace told us.
hellloo... so... it was not dwight after all.
i do not know, kind of just for fun.
it dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, let us get back in there.
yes, i am.
who we got?
god, oh.
"hope this helps.
dwight's going to take care of you.
yeah.
bagel?
it was only a simulation.
it is not!
email's not scary.
it is not even that interesting a baby otter, it can not even stand up.
absolutely not!
do you think that kevin is going over my head?
giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for ryan to do his morning ecstasy... we are already twenty minutes late.
no, i do not think i ever did.
nothing to fear.
oh!
and i will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it.
more personnel turnover.
that is pretty good.
I will drive.
wait, officers, are you sure you do not want to interrogate him?
narc!
look at the numbers.
black-eyed crows.
uh, duh.
i burned my foot on a george foreman grill.
and many more!
i was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.
tango.
i think an investor's ski trip is the best idea.
oh.
i need this job.
when did he tell you?
minorities sticking together.
so i looked him in the eye and i said, "not today grotti, not today.
jan is cold.
pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned!
oh my god, oh my god, no, no, no.
yes!
I have seen you eat it many times.
it is not cappuccino.
oooooh, yeah.
wonder what i would have been back home?
ughh... blech.
and tell him the joke.
i did wave.
you do not just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?
that just sounds weird.
mhmm!
hi!
do not try and think of a question to humor me.
I am going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.
nasa took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
she is.
there is tons of ideas in there.
we have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
oh, it would have worked out so well.
holly broke up with a.j last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me.
ok. thank you kevin, we will let you know.
not motivated by compassion.
um...thanks for listening, those who listened.
huge!
you guys are acting like you own this place.
oh, nothing much.
no all you do is you get me to try to work on my rich friends!
listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper?
you know, despite a couple hiccups, i think that went very well.
should i have reported oscar's malfeasance.
i feel like i need that.
could he help us with some parking tickets?
have a good night.
ok, goodbye prince family.
right.
why would i or anyone else think that you are hot right now?
on an innocent baby.
i will see her every now and then, and... maybe one year she will be with somebody, and the next year, I will be with somebody, and it is going to take a long time... and then it is perfect.
how are we going to do this?
well, do not let it happen again.
do you all know what it is like to be disabled?
everybody!
hey, right?
this is oscar-- right.
there she is.
even when i had walking pneumonia.
well, let us put  them in the hallway.
listen temp.
oscar, right here.
listen.
happy birthday.
a three ounce fetus is calling the shots.
where we going?
we are.
come on!
yeah.
they are treated like human beings.
thank you.
oh, we have a serious problem here.
holdin' down the fort.
okay, you know what?
what is going on?
i know, i know, i know.
how could you do this to them?
that- michael.
jim will be made a warlord's gesture.
no.
is this what i drink out of?
see how papa takes care of you?
okay.
takers, please.
see you all tamale.
talk to me.
i ruv you very much!
pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
i think the engineer left.
you did not see it, pam.
I am thinking we will have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
no, not right now.
kevin.
leave me alone, okay?
hey.
no, no, no, no, no.
he uh, guh recently, right?
somewhere safe, where it can not hurt anyone oh shoot!
this office, i think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it is probably more advanced than you are used to.
that is, uh, edward r. meow.
they are not my favorite people in the world.
as the best salesman, i am king of kings.
i even come in on holidays.
no.
i stole a sleeve of her sweater.
fire jim.
although, i will agree that her head is weird.
i need you to do something for me.
tell her I am not here.
this is my hair we are talking about.
every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at christmas.
your best one?
wait a sec.
okay.
all right.
I am here!
what the hell is going on back there?
did you ever have intercourse in this office?
okay.
wha - that is, i hate her.
not bad!
pam, you failed art school.
this is genius.
now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a sam goody gift certificate... ...and we need to be done by 9 a.m. tomorrow.
and she still is.
but, it is valentine's day.
i need your help.
well you look cute as a button.
respectfully, i do not want us walking into a similar angela kind of situation.
assistant regional manager.
come in!
i have done things like um, "beers in heaven." or, "total eclipse of the fart." i love to sing them, but i am not going to be doing that today.
presents are the best way to show someone how much you care.
summer or winter?
and now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can not be peeing all over the walls.
I am up.
but just know... if you ever lay a finger on phyllis, i will kill you.
okay.
i am the expert.
not yet.
well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good.
hello, dwight.
remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
i will.
dwight." that is a total waste of your "m." yeah.
why him?
come on, pam.
we are already in the city.
these are the people who will open their hearts to you.
i can not run.
no really, it is, it is very nice.
jim is her husband.
now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other.
opus dei.
mornin'.
I will take a little look-see.
getting defensive?
you would rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
tanks.
not even close, meredith.
here we go.
catch-22.
what would you have done?
i am going to put a surround sound system.
we done good in there, half pint.
no, absolutely not.
w-w-wait a minute.
pa rum pump um pum whassup!
but then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed.
they do not get that high.
uh, what flavor?
now that does not mean that jim is going to become a vampire.
no.
uh huh.
and i never actually talked to corporate about it.
did you sneeze it off?
you got to crack these things open.
crap.
to commit fraud.
boom!
it is okay.
michael, look.
good, good, bro.
here are some things that i want to teach you that your mother will not be able to.
okay.
wish i could fire sherri.
do not need it.
inventory's at the end of december.
we need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this!
so excited.
how do we stop it?
hey, kevin.
in fact, where are my keys?
that is exactly what i was thinking.
never say die.
you know what, sometimes it is not about whether cinderella gets her slipper back, but it is about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.
the three stooges.
that was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.
no.
i was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
okay.
alright.
if i had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow i pick-up in a bar, and these people?
that baby is a schrute.
no, it is not good enough.
i do.
mmm-hmm.
on the one hand, it is a relief to know that it is not just me, the whole office is cursed.
doubt it.
as the receptionist, pam is truly the gateway to our world.
I am not going get a brain- stop it.
sometimes you have to go for it.
damn it.
this encompasses all available data.
a kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?
i just want to know what is written about michael.
he came in today in a rage.
have her come out!
i was in the hospital room with her.
what kind of cake do you want imbecile.
I am not going to bump.
come on.
"hi.
thank you very much.
guys, guys, guys.
women look like white slaves.
I am not seeing anything under "confirmation." could it be under "affirmation?" because you have thousands of those.
a thousand big ones.
no, they are just hotties.
we did it!
I am going to get my carving knife out of the trunk.
oh, i bet.
and by the time i got out the pony was already in the truck.
because you are grossing me out.
come on, let us go.
must be this cool to ride.
ha!
obesity-caused illnesses.
oh my god, oh my god, that was very close.
ok, well i did not get the job in new york, but i got the real prize, domestic bliss.
oh hey!
mm-kay.
is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
ahh!
what do you want?
have a seat.
okay, so killing yourself.
now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.
it will be good.
but you have defeated yourself.
so here, just take my money.
no, you know what?
katy, toby.
ok, I am going to ask you something and i want you to be honest.
evel knievel.
because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
so officially, i did not see her.
joe mccarthy, richard nixon, studebaker, television, north korea, south korea, marilyn monroe, ryan started the fire!
i do not even have a cold.
how would i describe myself?
really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and... no, your job is being my friend, pam.
you know it is really more for a bachelor pad.
where is he?
hey... i can not imagine this place without you.
oh... actually, tomorrow's not good.
i saw wedding crashers accidentally.
i mean, it makes the battle of gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush.
look around you.
and i consider oscar a friend.
you must use a lot of paper.
I will get it.
conference room!
i do not want a purse.
have you ever seen a magician's assistant?
and that is not me being mean, dwight.
okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count.
he will call back though.
oh come on!
i have seventy.
made of real apes.
no you are not!
that is right jim.
yeah.
too bad you did not have sex like seven and a half hours later.
big butt, bigger heart.
stop!
okay.
on your left!
i need your urine.
now, i do not have any money so here is what i would like to do.
we are going to make everything all right.
tobee-yy!
any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
well, at least you are still being honest with me.
I am michael scott, and... i... am in charge of this place... ahh, what will make you... understand... i am... like superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of gotham city.
scranton!
okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis?
a. dear.
hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
stop.
keep.
i want to watch you get dressed.
alright.
stanley!
well, you know what phyllis?
he is covered in germs and bacteria!
good, I am glad we are on the same page.
it is an honor and a privilege.
i can not risk anything.
tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
ok. no problem.
everybody loves santa.
move to the exits!
so... i know.
oh my god, this is super weird.
since when have you known darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?
i do not want to blow this.
uhhh... blow out the candle.
no!
yes it is, but it had to be done, did not it?
no... that is... i do not... um... i can not hear your conversation.
let me tell you about men like him.
say it is not so, jo, we are going to miss you, we are going to miss you so much!
pam beesly.
pleasure to meet you, miss bennett.
does not even need to be good.
a shame to waste these.
you will see.
except daddy... is the best actor around.
or pukey.
do you have batteries?
a-holes.
they do not have cookies like the girl scouts.
excellent question.
i just found out today.
hey, friend.
yeah, jim.
i want it.
tonight has been one crazy night.
you put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.
let us talk pubes, people.
let us take the dirt road off to the side.
i forgot... i forgot... those are real cops, real guns.
ohh, i do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what i have to tell you.
okay.
do you know who that is?
i sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch.
we do not have any girls from hr.
oh, queer...  eye.
can i have an office?
stanley's wife is out of town.
this is a skating rink and i think the rangers practice there sometimes and it is, that is tina fey .
hey, you know why people here are complaining?
identity theft happens all the time.
he is... you know what?
called my man, dwight, just to see what was shakin'.
if you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
angela.
most companies need their carrots the next day.
there you go.
two forms of id, please.
and you know what?
there we go.
michael.
i have a very good feeling about it.
lice?
thank you.
okay.
oh come on.
three, two, one.
you just do not think i am capable, of making a difference.
do i really want to go snowboarding?
gotcha.
i have not even considered it.
ok. just one joke.
i can not.
i am always acting in self-defense.
i will make it very quick.
do you look like you are laughing?
'specially with me around.
you said you were not going to look back.
look at him over there.
jan levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which i have a vested interest.
i have to make a call after i finish... my work.
that is the law according to the rules.
dwight, congratuations a-wipe.
grassy knoll, boom!
I will get my apprehension kit.
brownies is it?
society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong.
no, creed, no they are not.
right?
they need to fight their own battles.
it is going to work very smoothly, because pam and ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from michael scott paper company and- no, you lost those clients.
very, very interesting.
okay, all right.
since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
how many of you have seen the documentary deliverance?
you do something to me that i can not explain.
i was thinking maybe like a mixer.
a dart?
he most definitely does.
that is very rude.
two at a time!
um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an eta when this is going to... you are starting, you are kind of losing them.
we are in crisis mode here, do you understand?
i could, but i just do not feel like it loser.
if he even wants it.
you know what might be kind of fun?
what?
let us try that again.
I am under this... I am under this hock here.
you did this, did not you?
why are you looking at my forehead?
come on, sales, over here.
stanley.
i had fish yesterday.
okay, okay, okay, okay.
that was awesome.
uh-huh?
i got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a she will hammer and bibs.
how you doing stud?
I am doing it.
okay.
women really go for that crap.
everybody!
it is stuffed pig stomach.
yes, it is.
come on, think.
guests only.
different management styles.
yes, an onion loaf for the table but that is not all.
no.
45 days to get us back on track.
how about this weekend?
there was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries.
okay, this is it.
and i am in the wedding party.
I will stay off the grid.
yeah.
do not you want a sheath for that?
i wrote "gay son" in green.
but if you think that extortion is worse - it was a beaumont-adams, if that helps.
yes.
good night.
hey, hey craigers, my man!
ambitious.
wrestle him to the ground.
oh.
he will never act again.
captain jack sparrow, jim.
dwight schrute is a close second with three and a half!
i was thinking about getting "back to the future."  "back" because it is on my back and "future" because I am the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future.
she is kind of a rube.
ooh.
i have not talked to jan since we broke up, and i think if she had something to say she would have called me.
i just do not - i do not know.
let me see  them.
really?
uh, leprosy?
son of a bitch.
alright.
hey, angela, rushy, rushy.
wow.
she is got a point about you two.
michael scott, head of sales.
very good.
so who are we laughing at?
i do not know that.
huh?
how does it...?
I am sorry i called you faggie.
my pants fell down.
ok, how is my voice now?
very much.
unless you want to chat.
i will tell.
it is.
ah!
gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz.
oh.
you will be back.
you looking for fun?
okay, this is not working for me, because no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
ok, everyone.
i mean look at that.
okay.
all cleaned?
whether you are scared of dying, or dying alone, or dying drunk in a ditch.
not to the good workers i work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.
do you even know anything about paper?
come on, big guy.
look at that.
if it is not my old partner, samuel l. chang.
i basically have the job already.
i made the whole thing up, dwight.
hey scott!" oh, oh, i was just watching that.
impulsivity and inattention to detail.
you me you!
besides a monorail.
exercise lengthens life.
will not that just she would more light on the penises?
yes!
how much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
you know i have soft teeth, how can you say that?
that is my stopwatch.
anything else?
good luck to you.
can not talk, saving the planet.
incorrect.
you have got a ton of dandruff.
it does not.
thank you.
chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
huh, ok. now you and i have a conflict.
right?
you said that i could not invite dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we did not have enough wine glasses.
wow.
and in ten years, i am living in a big house, with my kids.
ryan!
gaaaaa....
mmhmm.
tell him I am mad at jim, because he is asking us to give money to pam.
let us go out!
my boss is coming in today, the lovely jan levinson-gould will, well, no gould.
no, no, no pam let  them ring.
so... i wanted to offer you a new position.
good?
do you want us to run aground, woman?!
so where are you shipping... thank you.
that is what she said!
her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence.
have you seen that video?
dwight, care to join us, finally?
part of your duties are to what?
it is not anything you would have ever done.
i would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important... yes uh... i want it... i want it to embarrass all other parties.
no, michael.
five pounds.
it is like a slang for starbucks.
there is one that sounds like a jackhammer.
if he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
oh, kevin!
do not be an idiot.
yes.
it is just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor.
and then we can break out  my gift to you-complimentary white chocolate bark.
it is urgent, i just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
you.
this is the new addition, built my erasmus schrute in 1808. it doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009. did you just have a stroke, pam?
well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why do not you just throw one away now into my mouth?
but i need to know you in order to sell to you.
the fundamentals of business.
no!
michael adores me.
okay, okay.
i had a great time at prom.
this is an office.
true.
no, no, title change only.
oh, right!
i need someone to make a copy of this.
ok. if you make me head of sales one more time, i swear.
the math is simple folks.
i want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and i share after i have passed on to new york.
even if it did not, at least we put this matter to bed.
oh.
the door locks from the outside.
of michael scott!
got cat turd collector written all over him.
our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
that is jim's now.
stanley.
you were right jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.
oh, i assume I am going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
whoa.
i was watching you.
see?
damn it.
to the left?
peace out, seacrest!
nope, get away.
okay!
it is truly the silent killer.
who else?
town car is something that a company sends when they are in trouble.
no vendors in the office.
oh!
dwight schrute, assistant regional manager, dunder-mifflin.
no.
she needs you isabel.
you are a good, good guy.
and you closed it.
this one really smells like vanilla.
how ya doing?
why are all these people here?
you know what?
yes.
janet jackson.
that is preposterous.
let it go.
you... oh!
maybe you do.
you know what?
i wanted to ask your permission to ask out katy.
i wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars.
so as you know, the dundies are my legacy.
stop it, stop it, stop it.
because it was a good idea.
paper money.
text back, "kind of." i do!
ok, let us do this thing.
some that might be interested in a guy like me.
it is lower, so... all right, managing by walking around.
jim!
hey- come here.
oh, ok, well I am looking for a passionate affair, not companionship.
mmm-hmm.
to mama juju boo boo.
why does not she just tell you what your schedule is?
five strikes in a day equals a home run.
okay, you give  them a taste of cat food pretty soon they will be back for the whole cat.
but first, that is not my name.
take bat bites seriously.
laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
I have surrounded the enemy, and I am slowly starving them.
dun-der.
what matters to you is your precious speed limit.
the real thing is that stanley hudson had an affair.
and you must always wear the safety mittens.
you staying with michael?
"k" karen.
really?
still a chief.
alright.
no.
uh, yeah.
she is my family.
billy, your nurse is hot.
okay.
place is packed.
come on.
the toast is really not supposed to be about anything.
thank you.
no, no!
what if meredith was taking her smoking break below that window?
do you want some coffee er- or some tea or hummus or something?
it is going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere.
what, what happened?
when holly gets here, i want you to be very helpful to her.
aaaahh!
what makes a work environment excellent?
hello there.
answer me.
oh god.
nice try.
italians do not wear pockets.
a little friendly competition.
railroads, and sales.
stop it.
do i feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that i was invited to?
right now give it to me.
have a seat.
yeah.
in the schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention.
the cobwebs and such?
that is a joke.
those things are like ticking time bags.
yeah!
so the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
okay.
oh god.
i was ahead of the car.
ok. after you.
no.
and... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
that is all I am going to say about it because i have a gigantic performance ahead of me.
ok, pam, thanks.
this is moe.
"look on the supply shelf." what?
well, that-that is a great idea, jim.
i am done with this.
untested.
that is too private." here is how it works.
no.
no.
kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
look, men are visual creatures.
no, not this weekend; next weekend.
one, two, three... too many to count.
what?
okay.
do we save customer service?
that is a nice attitude, ryan, I am just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
you are so brave.
I have 90 clients myself.
all right, when we get a call I will come back and you will do the smile.
dinner, too.
right.
well, happy birthday, jesus.
what happened?
is christian slater back there?
now that i do not have a room, can i stay with you?
seriously, we are nothing like the guardian angels.
oh... meredith, why do not you tell holly... it is not what she thinks.
that is it!
muh.
go to him.
I am sorry to spoil jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we are almost out of gas.
one of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives.
who should i call with my magic sales fingers?
perfect.
I am just yankin' your chain.
welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome.
oh.
oh-kay.
oh, not likely.
alright.
hi, good to see you.
i am totally serious.
there ya go.
ah!
hey!
and uh, faster metabolism.
fine.
my father's name was dwight schrute.
well, yeah.
what?
all right, dwight.
i am trying to make your kids respect you.
we are going to take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.
how much do you have?
dwight, let me be frank.
I am sick of this.
did he call?
i say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension.
and it is r rated, it is not rated g. i am like eddie murphy in "raw," and they are trying to make me into eddie murphy in "daddy daycare." both great movies, but, still.
and I am hot, I am so hot.
not a good idea to say that to a woman however.
oh ho ho!
that was yoda.
does not make any sense... god is dead.
go enjoy your friday.
will you get out of here?
let me ask you- ok, let me ask you this.
okay, bye bye.
and you already know dunder-mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway.
hey, hey, hey!
what do you do with the hog dogs that you do not sell?
yes pleeeeease!
yes.
no, kevin does not have an elephant heart.
i think it went well.
it is a big cheque.
alright.
i have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
hello.
okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, kevin.
but... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy.
maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
kevin, we are going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
you are disgusting.
okay.
karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?
this is not the face of a performer.
ah.
okay, I will drive.
almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
gentlemen.
your job.
and i-- well that is ridiculous I am not going to make-- ah, so...  all right, levinson.
now, i would like to file an official complaint to corporate because darryl lied on an official form.
ah!
what is that letter, right there?
attention everyone!
oh.
okay... okay.
do not keep doing that.
and i will start, by giving the first gift to phyllis!
not nice.
that is right, let us do this.
kerrigan is ruler of the zerg swarm!
ok!
i was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
all their top clients i can not believe it.
and karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you do not already have one.
do you-would you have a snack in your purse?
good.
the willy wonka golden ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea i have ever had.

oh-oh.
wait, what?
god!
hey, hey, you know what?
humans are terrible for the environment.

the whole time.
wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at jim's desk while he is away in philly.

I am thrilled with the work they have done today, both quality and the quantity.
you know what, we should not even be talking about business today.
here we go.
okay, so dwight, in your own words -  "someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons.
stop!
is making people act weird.
sounds good.

like stanley, having an affair?
and we schrutes use every part of the goose.

I am not worried.

phyllis, you are hitler.
actually, i do own property.
take this pen and stab me with it.
no, just tell me what it is.

it would be my pleasure, mr. schrute.
uh, i have an announcement.
uh, i meet a lot of people.
dwight!
so clean out your desk, you are through here.
oh, here we go.
so without further ado, carol?
who wrote it?
who would i refer?
i guess the atmosphere that I have created here is that I am a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.
really jim?
something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.
sorry.
also, try to discuss it over indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
you do not know what you are doing.
having a bathroom is a privilege.
that is the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing.
i hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "uh... no.
ohhh happy birthday jim!
and i was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
and without denying the seriousness of the situation, i would just like to remind you that in much of the netherlands, swimming naked is the norm.
how do they do this so fast?
there he is.
i mean, who would buy that?
yes, phyllis?
ok, tell him that is not true.
dwight?
ah, i knew it.
jim, you are 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, gumby has a better body than you.
thank you for being so brave with all of this.
i need to roll an eight.
What are you got, What are you got?
meredith, men's room.
why do not we just do it now?
as my associate.
they are very formal.
this is a farce.
it is simple dollars and cents.
no footprints.
up and over.
enough is enough, I am - god, I am so mad!
what?
so this is his strike two.
really?
all right, let us count it down, like rockefeller center.
you do not read it aloud like that!
yee-haw!
now, i know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?" how do you know michael clump?
no, no.
michael!
all right, I have warmed them up for you.
this was a pretty disappointing day.
unfortunately, this item is on  back... order...  michael!
well, suck it up.
say it.
when i needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.
oh!
mmm-hmm.
i do not want to write your stuff for you, but i just want it to be good.
all right, get out.
i love it.
no, i am, it is all about the personality, jim.
i am an honorable man, and i will honor the contract.
you think i followed you in there?
could you please sign my expense report?
coffee is the great incentivizer in the office.
do you have an in case?
oh the rotating um, steam wand.
you do not know pam.
yeah.
please?
come on, hurry up you guys!
check to see if she is faking.
except excrement.
you want to come up and sing this one?
and if there was one thing i di... do not really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures.
where is that wine?
bare my child.
you got to let the cookies cool before you pop  them in your mouth.
super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
i want my old parking space back.
phyllis, no, no.
yeah... ready?
yeah, meredith.
huh?
I am not asking what you do in there.
just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules.
and you are going to put on your dancing shoes later on!
yeah, I have been sayin that.
why... i mean, you just come in and you are just negative... ...and you just walk negatively.
now, for the last time, I would like a side salad with balsamic.
yeah?
location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities... okay.
we regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment.
do not avoid this.
thank you, thank you very much.
jack nicholson for birdie.
a what?
you know what it means.
no.
mm!
uh... yeah i got a '78 280z.
if you want to talk to the new building owner, you should call nate and schedule and appointment.
here we go.
well I have got one.
hey!
i spent all morning on it.
i knew it!
as has angela!
michael.
oh.
you are the master.
i roped it off.
i also uh, subscribe to usa today and american way magazine, that is the in-flight magazine.
and he is gasping, he is panting!
beauty.
i marked her arm.
monkey see, monkey do.
your advice was good, but jan's was bigger.
okay, all right, i will do that.
i am loving these people.
um, yeah, i was just um, i just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the chili's.
america's eighth largest indigenous body of water.
could you take-.
all of my numbers.
it is like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against aids, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
no, I am not.
sometimes i feel like they are raising us.
no, i promise i will not do it again.
you would have done the same.
going to get it?
okay.
near near near near near!
oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile.
tmi.
i did not want everybody to know what it was.
i mean, i do not... i do not sit on your lap because it is comfortable.
maybe rattle off a few jokes.
i could fall and pierce an organ.
but guys, I am a victim here too, okay?
eww.
you are not a veterinarian.
was that an impression?
i put everything back in the vending machine.
nah, he is an ass.
which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." i do not understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.
hi.
ahh!
i can see everything.
i tell her to meet me in mexico but i go to canada.
I am... what?
goodnight, jim.
right?
yes!
very well, then i challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
do you mind if i wear that for the photo?
it was topical.
not more.
i could be french.
walkie-talkies.
i took care of that cat, the best way i knew how.
action.
yuck.
well I am sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so i appreciate you meeting with us here today.
i knew it was not just a trip to the beach.
that is our official name, jim.
just do it.
huhhhh, did you have johnny carson in your land?
how dare you, dwight?
how did you push away the bad thoughts?
but i can give you this pitch in one minute- still an important position.
thank you.
look at her.
out of, like, 18 billion americans, so, no worry.
do you like guns n' roses?
you are just filling that out right now.
here we go.
i need you.
what is the plan?
do you have your money belt?
da  na na na na.
oh, you know what?
oh no!
yeah.
is it called red-vining?
well, actu-too soon.
okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?
that is the image, i think we can all agree is very disgusting.
ooh.
lunch.
whatever it is that you are doing, and I will see you monday.
cool, cool.
just clearing my desk.
pam.
that is - yes.
he will be fine.
pam, I am coming down to get my present.
oh, I have got stuff on her.
me too.
hey!
wha-,  oh.
now you got it.
i do not know.
you feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it is really sad because everybody thinks you are a loser...  stop.
was that part of the...?
well- okay.
roll of duct tape and a knife.
it is about attitude.
jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
but had to end, because the summer was over.
no... cleaning... up.
okay, look.
nice to see you again.
here i am using it.
I am so in love with her.
but, listen, you have saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
come on, why not?
i lost respect for you in florida.
what do you like best about pam?
hey mer.
let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...?
okay.
it is, uh... oh, come on.
all of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
that is a serious offense.
thank you.
ha ha!
okay.
because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person i hung out with the most.
hey erin, look, these are nerds.
what do you say?
i want you to listen to me, friend, and i want you to listen to me good.
fact: 4 americans every year die from rabies.
i did not give you $40.
that is inappropriate, kevin.
jim, you know what would be really dastardly?
maybe there is some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too.
how do you un-tell something?
why not?
there is nothing to see.
no, sh- she did not.
yes.
I am calling security.
hello?
that is it.
his last girlfriend was a transvestite.
watching?
you call an ambulance, i call the cops.
um, i was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from hr, dwight.
at the playboy mansion.
deborah shoshlefski.
this remedy has been passed down in my family for generations.
but you just said 15. negotiation is an art.
rookie mistake.
so she is not jolly or sassy?
gould was stupid.
and the answer is clear.
i think i saw it!
i rewarded dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
what they do not understand is that i bought the stuff to impress potential clients.
how could he do this to us?!
here is what we are going to do.
yeah, you know me.
i do not.
the bread is poisoned.
good evening.
h&amp;r block?
oh.
p-a-m. p-a no it is okay, we are talking code.
that is what she said!
stupid.
no!
this is just what they want you to do.
we could go back and forth all day.
shut up, nick.
mmmhmm.
I am confiscating this.
my first order of business: make andrew bernard my number two.
jan and i understand each other.
happy!
whoa, whoa, whoa!
thank you.
yes.
I have written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and i think i have done my part with the golden ticket promotion.
here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.
and that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor.
show time!
what is happening?
so... you are the moron.
hi esther.
then you take these and clip them wherever.
what you do is you put  them in a room, and you just-  hey.
just... hey, kiddo.
okay.
so.
oooooh, my life!
he screwed up, not me.
it is sort of weird that i went and did that.
go tell her we are here.
hut!
no.
which is?
depression-- nn-- depression.
the trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
you were forbidden.
well... mm, the big apple.
really makes me want to go to italy some day.
could you start that one from the beginning?
I will call you, kid.
hold on, i have the address in my phone.
i have been sitting here for ten years, michael.
he was here?
what do you... what do you... oh, I am sorry.
let us quit while we are ahead.
oh, right, I am sorry.
4-9-1-7-4-5-1 they would never know it was me doing it.
nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition.
i know that we need to cut costs.
is this really the best use of our collective time?
sorry, just one second.
not pam.
i know.
visual aids.
did anybody see a package here today?
even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
it is borscht and its served cold.
i totally agree.
where?
do not be.
we sell beets to local stores and restaurants.
there is another smaller case logic portfolio clipped to my visor   what?
the point is, they are not unhappy anymore.

uh-oh, who is in trouble?
I will be back, i mean... why?
okay.

aaaah.
you do not have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
and their king bee.
this is michael jackson calling from wonderland.
the eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room.
hello!
i do not... well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
yes, i am better than you.
i hate her.
oh, god, I am so sick of chuck e. cheese.
i got his pants.
i took an oath when i was sworn in and i broke that oath today.
and then she will move back to scranton.
come on.
i learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year.
oh.
we do not need a new copier.
like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
to give you this .
he took my desk.
what you and jim have times 100. just she... she just left.
it is not a documented island.
yes.
smile and nod.
m.g.s.?
all i care about is mega-desk.
this is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here.
everyone.
ahhhh!!
which will not be hard, because it is going to be awesome.
bye bye.
no pun intended.
what happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
i love that face.
hey there.
let us go.
andy's afwaid?
but the point is i did the right thing.
come on in.
ok. thirty minutes or less, please come back.
no.
it is me, gun-safety dwight!
i need my girls with me.
those were probably misdiagnosed.
no.
alright.
oh, god.
contraption!
damn it!
what is this?
sort of a "where is waldo." alright.
i just think it is something that we should all be aware of.
I am fine, I am totally fine.
it has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here.
this is the dealio.
but maybe i need to be even approachabler.
okay.
fantastic!
okay, great.
am i going to tell them?
i am not a mind reader, david.
everybody's looking at you right now.
if you steal a thousand post-it notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you have made a profit... margin.
and, yes, I have heard women and children first.
tell me what is going on.
tell him, not dwight.
okay.
you wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who is still alive.
oh, my god, this is agonizing.
holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since world war ii.
and craig, you saw him, he is not the sharpest tool in the she would.
i have some bad news.
okay.
i am michael scott.
i know wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I will conference him in.
oh!
here we go!
I am going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.
so, while she is here i am going to be acting kind of cold to you.
all right.
no way.
be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
who knows how words are formed.
oh hey, i want to show you something.
that is a distraction.
and right now, i want a piece of cake.
call him in.
you ever tried those?
wow.
ok, it stopped.
give me the dice.
roman noodles are good too.
otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
what up is, what down is, who mom is, who dad is.
no grapes, no nuts.
i need some filing done.
well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can not even find their way to work?
michael?
no, my groin... ...is really tight.
where did that day go?
is it not?
part of my busy day, you know.
a hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
okay.
okay.
i know you are dying to say it, so just say it.
that plus jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
kevin, go!
no.
oh, I am sorry.
i learned a lot about women today.
scooch over.
that was your idea dwight.
this is just the front of her.
now, god, what?
I have never seen this place in the daylight.
i would have never called him that if i knew.
come on.
ok, can we steer away from gay people?
airplane.
oh, jim.
and as lazy parents become desperate i will sell them for an enormous profit.
but one would be good.
can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
yes!
what the hell are you doing here?
yeah, blah, blah, blah.
this is michael scott.
no!
but someday i think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids... all right.
do i have any messages?
was there an obese family in here before you?
I am letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary.
i will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
that is-- that is alright.
maybe!
it is not.
what?
where is my numbers man?
really funny, michael!
and it does not matter how great a guy i am.
pam, please clear my phone lines.
change your mind we can get you a cot.
let me check.
that good?
i will require beer and pizza to think this over.
look, it is easily accessible.
what are you worried about?
there he is!
come on.
you can not.
but the coffee in peru is far hotter.
and i figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.
god!
will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
do you get it?
try scared to death.
I am very picky.
would she get into trouble?
better make it two-thirds.
hold on, hold on darryl.
yeah, so what if i did?
why did not i go to business school?
we work hard, we play hard.
i do not want to say this twice, it is too painful and I am too depressed.
okay, uh, well, one is taken.
so?
okay, which side of the list am i on?
blessed be those who sit and wait.
do we have a desire to dominate the retail space?
12:01, january first, bam!
pb and j, my mom's recipe!
okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent.
that... your gut reaction is to say that, but i do not!
my minds made up i am not going to change my mind you can not talk me out of it.
and even though we are still a family here at dunder-mifflin, families grow.
i just could not picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight.
check her out.
right, so- why do not you explain what that is to- so that they can under- just explain what that is.
i sold it on ebay.
say your name is zamboni and then i will say, 'well, we are sort of on thin ice.'  i will not say that.
whoa!
and you got to blame them.
we actually went to the poconos last tuesday.
and, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.
on one condition.
for instance, "thank you, mr. blank.
what is up with you?
you could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
no... god.
me had an i-rey time.
previous record?
jim, as a matter of fact, i have printed out ten ways to induce labor.
six-million dollar man!
why are you here?
yes.
because a real relationship, it... it can not be forced.
haha ha.
we kind of do...  god... we sorta do more of like powwows or- that is- you know what, everybody?
look at that.
sometimes they come from neighboring...  we have one of the globetrotters, i am the skipper, and dwight, you will be gilligan.
i do not see what is so ugly about him.
hey, there he is!
really?
i could not do that, jim.
oh.
oh, yeah.
would you excuse us... he has not changed.
i prefer the human way.
thank you for your honesty.
you are?
there is stink in there, my god!
bad boy.
what the... damn it!
not a chance.
ok, change shirts with me.
absolutely, i do.
true.
do not worry.
thank you roy.
i was thinking we could name the company something like, "paper great.
how is the new boss?
and that is   hard.
it is... these are people's lives you are talking about.
this is not a place for gum.
look, i think we need to set some ground rules.
if you disagree, say anything...  very well.
remember the narc bit?
michael.
what?
i will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
come on, get it out.
now i need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
have a seat.
into a machine?!
that face, how ugly he was?
ow!
trust fund will take care of that!
who else has an idea?
uh, yes.
okay, well, a pleasure.
dwight!
andrew bernard.
yeah, way to go phyllis.
of course it was you.
sorry, too busy can not even come to the door.
that is what she said.
i feel so weak, i just... what do you want me to do jim?
this is what I am talking about.
the cfo?
in jamaica, i took one.
whoa, 'scuse me!
a good manager does not fire people.
then ryan wins.
god, that sucks!
i just, i need something kind of embarrassing, you know.
there is only one hope left for you.
new plan, okay?
there is nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
when it goes off, no more kissing.
okay.
oh- god!
thank you, oh, gah, here we go again.
never, ever, ever give up.
this is where i fell in love with you.

here we go, he is early with the cue.
menses." "the uterus contracts after your egg passes through it." oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
do you have any idea how many guns trevor's had stolen from him?

or in this case an email gets sent to robert california containing the consultants report from last year.
my lord my liege.
yeah... i... you know what... i... i... i just thought about it.
</p> yes i do.
are you going to kill me?
i did not... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.
pam!
you brought it on yourself.
for that, i do have to thank my appendix.
incredible news.
what are you doing?
well, then just have the tomato and ketchup.
i know.
and we called him my brother.
total integrity.
go!
hiya!
okay, since this is the disputed poster.
that guy?
you have to write my suggestions down, too.
this is him: "hey!
jim.
no!
all right.
can i talk to you about something?
wow, wowie wowie.
i do not follow.
aaand is about 90% sure.
well, i do not believe that.
get out.
uh, yeah.
we are all on the same team here, the dunder mifflin team.
um... yeah.
hey jim-bag.

no.
re-adapt.
it is nice to see you.
wow, that is- thanks so much.
okay, just breathe...  she?
no, he is not.
that would be fun.
you certainly seemed jealous when i told you about my fake girlfriend.
that is rule number two.
this machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.
you know who my favorite character in toy story is?

who is sarah kayacombsen?
respect.
bye, bye toby.
god.
internet.
they have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so... oh, yeah.
but toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.
alright, dwight, knock it off.
those kids!
no seriously.
it is like the firemen.
no, no like this.
oh.
fortunately i have found it befo-bat!

met with jan, re: log.
you forged them!
i did so well last february that corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.

does he even have a girlfriend?
hm?
ok. then jim and pam and ryan plus a guest.
you are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
we could sell medicine and other... well... this might not be the right time, but i need more than i originally asked for.
no, you need to go upstairs to the party so people do not notice we are both gone.
no, we-no.
who is he saying?
oh, no.
i feel so good right now.
no one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is toby, why do not you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
i think toby's very jealous of all the attention you have been getting.
have fun.
at dunder-mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and i do not know who instituted it.
oh, well thank you very much for all of your help.

well, i think we all know what you are capable of meredith.
i do not know, i can imagine her with another woman, can not you?
you.
uh becauseaEUR  no that is all.
i have a conflict with that.
wow.
ask him his name.

pull over!
i was just jogging.
I am casting a movie and I am looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman.

jim!
um...  i decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up phyllis and kevin.
answer the door.
makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
do not think, say it.
i will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life.

I am so sorry, sir.
my point i this: i have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
observe.
of all of the vermin in god's great green kingdom, lice are the ones i detest the most.
good!
nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best i guess.
it is all right.

you can never pull together as one and revenge us.
you idiot.
good to see you.
shotgun!
i just do not see a point in the dundies!
come on.
oh ho hokay.
stanley knows what I am talkin' about.
i do not know.
you have done more then you can possibly know.
but uh, you know what.
going to be fun!
all right.
no, no, no.
oh you do not, that is- that sounds good.
right.
and you know what?
they would say things like "do not pay for six months" or "you can transfer your account from another card"... do you think I will get any new ones?
yeah.
does it stink?
uh, yeah.
i just think a tattoo should mean something, you know?
is there somebody you date?
long drive in the car, so let us just- we will just continue.
that is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter.
fine, let us go.
check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
yeah!
like a grandmother.
it might be innate goodness versus innate badness?
you know who that is?

run with it, kev.
wha - god!
what can i say?
and he is like no, i like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
wait, wait a minute, what is this, i did not order this?
besides, he would end up being a hero anyway.
so I will keep you posted on that.
yes, you may tell me one thing.
okay, fine.
i am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may.
nothing but net.
I am not going to make this call.
you know what guys?
alright?
listen, when i saw you talking to erin earlier, i noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I am assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
I am eating jims.
what?
kill me... right now.
baldy, your head is bald.
racism is dead stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want.
yeah, okay, dancing!
you did not contribute very much.
okay.
i refuse to be judged by someone that i do not respect.
no.
there is a live audience out there!
i can not believe i get to be with you.
the least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation!
and i think it is better to die with people you like... like oscar, and andy, and concierge marie... than to know that there is somebody out there that you love that you are not with.
this happens to computers and robots sometimes.
three, two, one.
i am?
excuse me, everyone... sex!
it is about how you feel about the dundies.
and for what purpose?
will you just give us a second?
a torpedo's coming right at me.
thank you very much.
yes.
later on.
i understand.
oh!
obviously.
andy approved it.
that is not true.
we sure would love to see them.
come on.
a lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
it is football cream.
this is about doing, not thinking.
oh.
been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but i am here to scare you straight.
much appreciated.
what are you doing?
ok, aunt shirley, dear, uh, can i get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
she is...  you do not deserve her.
come on.
I am sorry.
if you are guessing forty six just say forty six.
stop it.

hey, i could get some flares from my car.
psst.
oh, hey, listen, um, since i have you on the phone, um, can i fire jim?

hoist him aloft.
everything's a joke.
look, you are all hypocrites.
fuggedaboudit!
i know, i know, i know, i would not be offering it if i did not think you could handle it.
what is the antidote?
ok, i apologize for yelling at you.
she smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
yep.
phyllis.
all right, yep.
i knew it right away.
he was... he had an inability to communicate, shall i say?
i should.
today, i leave here a regional manager with a black belt.
be right out!
i know.
ji.. why not?
there he is.
frankly, I am not surprised.
ok guys, listen up.
if you fall in love with her.
i think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
oh god.
michael is gone.
listen up, listen up.
it is not even lunch yet.
oh noaEUR  freak, i need a favor.
as a boss, i look at that and say great.
that is bull crap.
the bowels of the office.
does anybody have anything?
um, i wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she is allergic to hay.
no, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I will-okay, I will be back.
what?
so... oh, stanley kaplan!
it just- i could not help it.
do you like candy?
i am.
here we go.
perfect casting, right?
i wished for jan to get over me.
will not happen again.
"i feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business." yeah.
um, and the other bouncers caught up with me and really did a number on me... it was in the paper...  but to answer your question, yeah, I am really excited about this weekend.
if you do not hear from me by lunch, call me.
back off.
you know, that is the thing!
no, but i -- oh, no.
what?
good.
oh.
i think you are inspired.
i did fall on my sword once.
good for you.
she makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
do you?
ah, it is after five.
the taliban in afa-ghanistan.
instant death.

i do not need a gun.
i will be honest with you.

well, you know what?
nellie, thank you.
because people out there are expecting it.
a child is born, "oh, oh-hum." a beautiful sunset, "no, I will catch the next one." right?
do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire?
some people need dozens of friends to say, "hey, look at me, I am popular." but not me.
look at that.
it just kind of goes round and round.
it is not going to be tacky.
i understand that, dwight.
that guy!
maybe.
you know?
guys have been...  glasses, turban, ear hair, fatty 3, shorts, fatty 2, lozenge, and fatso.
and i will see you there... burning.
yes!
thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances.
because please stop, okay?
he is right there.

nope.
I am getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there is a mini-reunion.
I am scared I am going to love it.
ice skates, shopping bags?
not on angela's boob.
ok, well since i am leading this, let us get down to business and why do not i just kind of introduce myself, ok?
no work.
i forget, are you guys dating?
we can do... oh.
wait.
all the channels are going to be different there.
well, thank god they are not because we do not want to make zombies.
i will have a girlfriend once she sees this place.
cutie-pie.
pam?
okay, calm down.
excuse me  ah, un guard.
no, frankly, i do not.
the sepia tint is from an app on my phone.
what is so funny?
i actually wear a turban sometimes.
not at all.
i withdrew too.
i got some stomach cramps.
we tell them the plan, right?
then i refuse.
well i understand that but this is a $45 watch.
nothing is going on.
you and i are hangin' tonight.
you will find this hilarious.
i will give you and your purses a ride home.
what do you think?
the office looks different now.
now come at me!
andy, I have been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should i join?
i was not talking literally, creed.
f and c, doubletime.
it is so wall street.
come in.
you will never guess what i know.
you know what?
you know you can always refinance your mortgage.
so after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, i have decided to make jim my new number two.
no.
okay, see ya guys!
prison mike.
i should have been there to witness this.
I am glad you told me.
now i know what bob hope was going through when he performed in saudi arabia.
i know this russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
you are going to hell stanley.
one.
we will.
it was kind of a slap in the face to realize that i was not as important as i thought i was to a certain young executive who i cared about.
kevin, i can not decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke.
no, because we are the three amigos.
we need to talk!
now.
[todd starts humping dwight and michael who are still under the desk.
i have assembled what i believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today.
so this year, i have decided to have a co-host.
it is coffee.
he was doing it for his kids.
i can not.
okay.
ok, that is fine.
bye.
one thing you need to know about me.
do you and pam ever get frisky?
no, that is unacceptable.
you do not even have a girlfriend.
the mall, the stores, the kiosks!
busted.
okay.
what happened?
that guy miles who quit to form his own company?
yes.
your own paper company.
pound of fish.
oh, wait a second!
jo, jo, i can assure you it was no one in this office.
do not patronize me, pam.
okay, i know what you are all thinking, "who is this smart little cookie?" her name is brenda... something, and she is from corporate.
yes i was.
you tried to break into the machine.
good morning.
well, they whipped people which was helpful.
yeah, baby, i am feelin' better.
it is about us all.
what?
come-on... come on, come on.
i sort of set the tone.
i am not in the wrong here.
let me write my room number on the card.
bye.
yeah.
in case michael or andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day.
if you do not like it, stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
you think this is some kind of game?
stop it!
you are ruining it, already.
he is following up.
oooh, okay.
five years from now, what do you want to do?
i sensed that molly was not quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... hunter.
obvious xm radio?
it was right under his nose.
does not matter, it is an order.
those who can not farm, farm celery.
they do not.
yep, he is lying.
no, damn it!
i do not need his permission.
so i could tell them apart.
nope, can not make it.
laying a base.
of course i seesaw.
hello hello!
yeah.
a lion eats me and I am dead." well, I am not dead.
not even close.
this is my girlfriend - carol.
yes!
my hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump check it out good.
esther's on her way up.
I am been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you are going to throw it all away?
that can only mean one thing.
thanks.
know what is going to happen next?
you know, dwight, there was a time when you would be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
it was all my idea.
that... nobody panic.
things were not this bad when just michael was manager.
and that way, we will be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored.
here we go.
boom!
phyllis, did you get the live storks?
so, What are you up to this weekend?
tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
okay, fine.
yes, absolutely david.
next time you are there say "hi" to my cousin amel and then kick him in the groin area because he is a cheat and a ball hog.
all right.
cons: not a hard worker.
i am well, sir, how are you?
you smell nice.
and i want you to reflect.
what a douche bag!
no.
it is a trick question.
not now, not ever.
so, it is still an upgrade.
let us go.
I am stronger.
mhmm, no i paid 500 dollars for that.
this is the birth story.
ridiculous, angela.
everybody?
but we are going to let this one slide.
you know, there is no controlling it.
because I will do it.
how is your nephew?
hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
actually i think it is not loud enough.
oh, umm, ever since i started here, I have kept a diary of all my sales.
pam left her ipod at her house.
oh, phyllis got flashed.
but you do not have to go to class to be in class.
but you know what?
now, one at a time, i want you to express your feelings using "i" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements.
jim is gone.
post-it notes.
you can keep that.
ok. good.
too much.
games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.
how are you?
anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list.
all right, listen up, please.
garbage magnet, god!
or, i will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
rollercoaster!
josh porter, high five.
i can not do this myself.
hey david, I am back.
for that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible.
I will tell you what is going on.
every year!
just... yeah.
so now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
oooh!
on it.
I am thirsty, mama!
we are not a sweat shop.
for any reason, whatsoever.
if you think she is cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.
no.
no, that is skeptical.
stop it, stop it!
hello!
no!
i can not impregnate you, and that is the driving force between male-female attraction.
okay.
ok, you have got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
what kind of filing?
dark side or light side?
no, no, no!
we have to have done something wrong.
I will get some punch.
worse than that.
we will ask the questions!
yes i do.
let us see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
oh, okay, here is a good one.
or is he going to join the dwight army of champions?
i grew up on a farm.
over the shirt, my elbow, but... um, yup, wait, yes.
his name's andy.
get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me.
go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
there is a sure fire sale, but it is a two man job.
you know what?
adam's apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla.
you are now sexy in your culture.
what is the most important thing for a company?
you were being really funny, and then you went too far.
i have bags under my eyes, and i can not go to new york like this!
I am not here to be given anything.
how 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?
oscar martinez, cheer or fear?
hey pack-man.
que?
nice beaches, pristine beaches?
in terms of land, not population.
congratulations, bob.
happy birth moment, michael.
so please, uh, make yourself at home.
this is oil from the gland of an otter.
this is not my fault.
so anti-drug that i am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
ok, what are they?
and next time, why do not you pick a co-host, that does not have microphone-a-phobia!
you have the day off.

because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
because you are in a wheelchair.
that is the ability to know when something is about to happen.
you can go to hell, too.
so... ...but i think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that clark's getting out of my car.
i can not hear you!
because we have lost a member of our family and you do not want to talk about it, you do not want to think about it, you just want to get back to work!

is that what you are saying?
hai.
just like i believe in all of you.
no thank you.
and fourth, getting presents.
I would have to get some more wire and string, but it is doable.
now.
that is what i have to say.
pam, jim, kevin, stanley.
okay, now the beer.
what if we can not do it quickly?
what do you mean hmm-um?
mmmm... ... i asked for trick candles.
it is.
now stanley is a dundie all-star, are not you stan?
look i could probably handle it, yes, but i think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
you can not be serious.
i do not know.
michael- where is he going to sit?
good morning.
oh!
together we run a no-nonsense office.
jim tricked me into thinking I would won a walk-on part on ncis, but that is not important.
i think she is... no that is very unprofessional.
keep it going.
darryl, what is your biggest fear?
right up my alley.
have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
i do not know where she is.
oh man!
oh yeah, i guess i did let him be a robot.
no, I am serious.
ho, thirty years.
i have donna.
what is going on?
i can not believe you came.
ok. it is a fish.
ha, but this one could not see it, or did not want to see it.
yeah.
yeah?
hello.
thank you.
i would love that.
okay, sold!
and... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I am crying, and nobody can hear me, because i am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
let us kind of take it a little slower.
i should have spotted another addict.
i do not know what he is doing.
you know what?
okay, here is the thing about january she talks such a big game about, "oh there is nothing between us and stop talking about it." and "border-line harassment when you call me at home." but let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on valentine's day?
no.
well if you take a look at this, i tented my pants.
you did not recommend me?!
dwight, do you have the box?
do not want it.
thank you.
reservation for michael scott.
on the contrary, I am helping cornell.
but, we have to try and that is why i created the integration celebration.
brain food.
well here we go.
what do you think of this place?
cons, she does not always follow through.
I am a deer hunter.
i find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
i left him all the tools he needs.
no.
and boom!
nice try, how is your pollack-says-what index?
may i please speak to your boss?
all right.
mostly get rid of waste.
your bill, minus the ten percent dunder mifflin corporate discount.
you do not know?
andy bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!
uh, here we go.
that is so juvenile!
no, we do not know that.
may i have your attention please?
because i am so angry over all of this.
and that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
by 2020, they are going to be the world's largest economy and they are getting a taste for protein.
they are using the lift as their own personal elevator.
kevin?
just.
can not allow it.
wh-  i do not need $6 to help a friend.
and that is why, i feel, that i deserve this raise.
what do you... well, you said good luck to jim as he walked in.
well if you need me, I will be on the other side of that wall.
yeah!
do i have what it takes?"  and i think we both know the answer.
deliciousity.
ok. ee... i was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
ok, everybody.
it is unnaturally sunken.
take the stairs!
lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved.
tell me if I am smiling or not.
hello, susan?
i do not want to say.
i have no filter.
that makes sense.
what does the female vagina look like?
i love working here and i do not want to leave.
good.
justifiably.
oh, i own that city.
a little cover-up on your adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite.
good night.
let us go.
i blew this.
so.
wrong.
the foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
and it could mean, that you are next.
that makes a lot more sense.
okay.
better handling.
i want you to update all the emergency contact information.
mm-hmm.
can you believe it?
psst!
ha.
oh, there we go.
parkour!
do you have the sharpie?!
yes.
okay?
get in the back please.
in which case, we are in for an epic, confusing showdown.
no.
what?
stop it.
thank you.
what was that?
i went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
yes, darryl, the sales department makes sales.
she is dead?
the other side serrated for maximum damage.
like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.
coat!
hey.
man, he is late.
yeah.
people say, "oh, it is dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place." well i say, "it is better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose." do i believe that michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment?
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
okay, some for, some against.
two minutes apart.
i think i made that very clear in the fliers, fun, f-you-n. well, i think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
um, the real way is that i found a flyer.
best salesman I have ever met.
no, toby!
no of course not!
oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
stop... stop it!
and they have some good points... do not get hysterical.
psh!
cool.
what is this?
guys, beef!
okay, what i would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to toby flenderson?
um... okay, "meredith is so old..." if everybody... could do it?
no, i go for the chandelier.
so see you in meredith's van in five minutes.
and frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now i find very alarming.
escape is impossible.
the end.
do you think they have any s'mores?
no.
wow.
oh.
and he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he  what?
and i know you are all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' well, I am not crazy.
pam!
because i was thinking that since jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who is here every day.
check it out.
i think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
angela.
look at that!
continue.
no!
but i ignore your cries and do not let you in.
i want to watch tv." you have everything?
what does what mean?
really?
that goes directly to the tester.
no really.
sex.
it is fine.
and... I am... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment.
they say those who can not do, teach.
look at that.
do the monkey face!
I have never taken anybody there before.
she is a beautiful indian woman.
does not matter, because i am going to take a nap.
try again!
ask stanley about that.
chuck it.
so here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building.
where are you?
but i still feel sorry.
ew, okay, all right.
what?
he took me to a baseball game once, i remember.
oh, man!
this is not some sort of construction site...or all of italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat.
you are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
give me some.
how would i know?
all right... I am deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine.
ryan, you ready to do this?
you took that with you.
genius.
it is hot in here.
no wikipedia.
so, you are filming history.
you think you are excited?
shh.
and you look like one too.
with all the feeling to base a show around.
you are thinking of deer penis.
do you know where your kids are?
i would be happy to.
stop it.
wash your hands, kevin.
michael could i ask you something?
no.
have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
oh hi everybody, it is ping!
crystal clear.
they are into style.
let those things breathe.
marv something?
yeah.
and i do not care that phillip's not my son.
my heart soars with the eagles nest.
we are done!
ahh, come on.
ok. fine.
i know exactly what to do.
if we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  "apology accepted", i think we would all feel better.
it is one of my dreams.
yes.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
i got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
circle 'round.
the story about me getting into improv was that i was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says "hey you are funny, you are the funniest guy I have ever seen, or my name is not dale earnhardt."   and that was an improv.
good to see you.
no, please, please... ok, let us take 15, again.
i know how many hospitals we have, i know how many schools we have.
how are your sales doing?
but you need to decide; otherwise I am taking the bonus.
we hang out a ton, mostly at work.
all right.
sorry, sorry.
because if we do not play, then the other team wins.
you think this kid could be a fighter pilot?
dammit!
we both know why I am here: to see... you... naked... while... I am... naked.
awesome.
deangelo, tell your who are to leave me alone.
and uh... do you have anything to say to me?
I am embarrassed it was even that close though.
turns out meredith has been exposed to rabies.
fine.
just a wet blanket named pam.
little of this, little of that.
tractor pulling.
what about shoe la la?
i think i would have been good at choosing the person.
okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
everybody!
we cannot let them get away with this.
here you go.
i wish todd packer was here because he would love this.
thank you, ryan, for that wonderful introduction.
now I am getting her voicemail.
yeah, do it!
12:00 midnight.
oh, man, i knew it.
am i the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
be my eyes.
it was a trick question.
it is sad.
oh no, that is too bad.
I am not following you.
if you left, i would not have to fire anybody.
ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
kenny g. god.
thank you.
he is like batman, I am like robin.
what am i supposed to do with this?
i know just the guy.
that is just so disgusting!
hmmm... she is been talking to michael a lot.
ok, here we go.
what kind of stuff is that?
i am declaring a moment of silence right now.
oh, wow.
...like a tip?
are you?
I am not there, jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
no, you know what is messed up?
well, let us just say whoever was ahead won.
dunder- they,  well, okay i see security is coming so i just want to say, come to dunder mifflin.
why did i do it?
... and i feel free!
no!
yeah, we can stick with last year's, you are just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
if we keep doing it, we are not going to want to jump.
they went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
they really do that.
what?
her name was pam.
she suckered you too.
okay!
you did this for me?
hey carol, how goes the real estate biz?
awesome blossom.
and he shoots incredibly high.
I will give you a hint.
hi.
and if he is still married to clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too.
so this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing.
come on!
ordinarily i would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up.
four days ago.
bye.
spiderman, peter parker, would not reveal his love for mary jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the green goblin.
okay.
slavery versus the holocaust.
was that your per diem?
we will go to the dump, we will look around, then we will all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night.
you will find something else and... awesome.
i want you to bring a partner.
okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.
go!
so if you think you are hurting... oh, wow look at those.
what?
thank you, scranton strangler.
let us do this!
it is going to be fine.
that was me, i got a little carried away.
that is me.
what?
you called bob?
and you make sure to get down there and check out that harry potter world.
okay, no, no, no, no.
yes.
it is the best.
i swear phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at dunder mifflin.
i am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, oscar.
wait a second.
shh!
i, ok, listen.
and then i say, "hey!
it is set our industry back quite a bit.
you see, i used to run with a very tough crowd.
pun.
i know where this is going.
alright, in my defense... shut up oscar.
paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
there she is - jan levinson.
well, that is not the david wallace that i remember.
here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I am at it.
c'mon, c'mon.
you will sell me this car.
since when do you care about money?
okay.
umm... this one says chair model... that sounds good.
men find me desirable.
i am sending you some email.
going.
wow.
stanley is having an affir.
where is kevin?
when i left staples, i took some of their leads with me but i never intended to use them.
you coulda killed me.
friends joke with one another: "hey um, you are poor." "well hey, you are mama's dead." that is what friends do.
i want you to fall on your sword for me.
and maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night.
and you know what, stanley?
not attracted to her anymore.
"i need to see this play like i need a hole in the head."  and i hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious aids joke.
your path from obesity begins right here!
i wanted samuel's voice-  to be like this!
it is just that you say it is going to cost what it costs-- put him through.
is this elevator going up?
now i want everybody to take a look to their right.
yeah.
yeah.
well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there is a lot of dumb people out there.
oh, anything bad?
dedicated phone book ripping station .
act.
that is where you first met michael klump.
they are either going to say yes... or no.
birthday lunch.
I am spending a fortune on gas and tolls - um, that... i do not know.
in the islands, they do not make you do stuff like take inventory.
how do you, partners!
yeah, that would be amazing.
where?
ah!
and three, two, one... jump!
no, no, no, no.
woo!
thank you.
ah, french.
wait, hold, hold, hold... so it is true?
such a chorus girl.
if you are watching this, that means I am already dead.
take six.
i do not know.
my head is in such pain!
okay.
right there.
pretty good.
you do not understand.
your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay?
actually, he is right in front of us.
yes.
okay, you are never going to believe this.
yeah, you said "in an ideal world, there would be a cash prize."  is not that what you said?
here are some downloaded peaceful sounds.
i was not given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me.
...and the kind of discounts we are talking about are not... hold on - michael, why do you keep looking at the front door?
dude, I am going to nail it.
back to work.
so stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story.
who is doing a toast?
do you hear me?
i understand.
look kids, your daddy left that face hole..." i dunno, it is a good feeling.
no!
that does not sound crazy, jim.
listen, things are changing here, michael, they are changing fast.
why do not they just make the plane out of the airline food?
what?
let us do this.
t.m.i.?
does not count.
you guys hungry?
whatever.
i can not imagine the sex being bad, i mean her body is... ...awesome.
so why is this on your resume?
pussy.
i can make more sales than a computer.
once again, jim, i will take care of this.
hurry up.
you know me.
i could of- ok. yehhhehh.
let me ask you this, if i were- pssh, kay.
we have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.
good.
do not - make the party, please, phyllis.
and so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, i would like to say that dunder mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.
dwight.
hey.
no, carol.
and they have no arms or legs.
what?
good work pam.
okay?
it is a joke, dwight.
can not you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
well, you are boner-ific.
hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio.
we are going to choose team names.
it is the swat.
I am going to launch him.
and i consider myself a great philanderer.
k, I am going to need some help.
so check out how we live they call it scranton!
i think i know why.
jan is insane.
cool it.
oh, hey, hey, um, should i bring a dictionary to the hospital?
you have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things.
good ideas are simple.
yeah, but i destroyed it, it is not even useable anymore.
$49 per month.
because i do not think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart.
really?
loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
unless provoked.
well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, ryan.
we should give him a one-way ticket to montego bay, where they keep all the al-qaeda.
yep.
i am going to come at you, and i am going to come at you hard.
why do they want me to come, too?
it is a casual, social outfit.
well... that is random.
i love that!
boo.
well I will just... I will use different money for that.
andy, what time's the show?
right?
a mediator's tool chest.
listen up everyone!
so what is going on?
yeah, they used to.
how is he going to have grandkids?
sorry.
he he.
it was a lovers' quarrel.
hi.
it is not.
oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
this is not dwight schrute!
like stretching and... wow, that is... that time really adds up.
good.
tmi!
let us be professional, all right?
yes!
yes you are.
okay, show of hands.
come on, let us go!
no!
it is really long.
wallace does know that you have been gone for the last three months?
nothing but net.
who, me?
have not you seen ghostbusters, pam?
i gave her a higher clearance than you.
yes?
hey, michael.
c'mon!
come on, give me something good!
for your information -- I am being sabotaged.
i mean, is this... two bowls of m&amp;ms and some balloons?
here, get down!
it does not make any sense.
never see it coming.
erin  erin... hey buddy.
hey.
what about her looks?
michael, please.
it just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
i think i am going to use my complimentary blindfold.
I will talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
living in fear!
i can do this.
jim, jim, jim, jim, jim, jim, jim.
the eyes are the groin of the head.
and yes i know its january.
ok, everybody, let us suck in our guts.
today's a special day, because i am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you... in business school, kevin.
come on old lady.
although last time... she pretended she did not hear me.
and any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.
you know what?
ok?
pam, I would like you to meet ronnie.
i can travel anywhere except cuba.
oh, actually, while i have you, not that i have you or have ever had you, but we are having our casino night tonight and i think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
i know it was you.
three reams!
do you think that smoking drugs is cool?
good boy.
oh please!
apart from abolishing slavery?
oh hey, i know you... elizabeth?
whatever you need, I am right on the other side of this wall.
that is why you made the decision.
because i am not going to call sabre and say, 'hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today?
okay.
michael?
did somebody say "baby back ribs"?
what, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'?
but i did see jan there.
terrible news.
are you going to take this the wrong way?
come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
that is crooked on that side.
i have spent the last month here at dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after jan and i, um  ssp... no, i did not kill her.
on three, we are going to hoist away!
you will get there.
but, we have people with the biggest hearts.
jim!
it is got a lot of me.
it is been sitting in my car all day.
powerpoint is boring.
you have it?
come on over here, big boy!
pussy.
I will be out of your hair.
that is, you know what?
oh good, you are up.
oh, god!
let us go on a little walk.
okay, you have got one hour.
i just need to tell them.
toby killed this bird.
so, I have got my new york girl and my local flavor.
well, think of it this way: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that i am applying to the office are the same ones that have made lady gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.
I am going with her.
you know what?
michael!
people laughed at klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
other people's... something.
wow, that sounds so... warm.
i did not.
okay.
what a nice guy.
they sent a limo.
it is very important to own property.
and the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.
engaged are not married.
that was it.
let go.
recyclops will have his revenge.
the ace of babes.
fine.
get back to work.
you are with big brother?
hello, oh god, busy work.
well, you know what?
come on, I am busy.
come on- here we go.
okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
scranton is great, but new york, is like scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.
you can not fire me, i do not work in this van!
you do not understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant?
okay, fine.
that is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
ohhhh.
too expensive.
we only have a few weeks left.
you know what?
i scored these great aisle seats.
you and the history books.
packer and i once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that <i>they</i> were crazy.
i think i just have to wait out you.
okay.
blacks do crack!
plus, we were not allowed to see movies.
jack bauer.
thank you.
what -what are you doing here?
not even close.
so i was thinking, if you have not already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from baskin-robbins.
ryan!
she called it crazy?
hello, hello!
and we are in.
alright, meeting.
"michael, buy a motorcycle." so i put the money in my shoe, and then i forgot about it until now.
never been sick.
i want you... to be assistant regional manager.
thank you.
yeah, well look...  what about me?
i will never be your vichyssoise.
nope.
you guys are getting all of these.
you must pass the dungeon wisdom test.' jerk.
where you going, big guy?
you wanted the job, the job is yours.
all right!
there are over four hundred of these!
oh, ok. what is that, like, a video game?
michael appears to be gay too.
but i do want to talk to you about something.
everybody, you know what?
that is what i thought.
pam?
you occupied the america room for six weeks.
I am baaaaaack!
all right, let us go.
i think we should share an awesome blossom, what do you say?
no, no no- that is a good gift actually.
yes, but you could tell me.
let me slow down a little bit.
you do not... you do not call retarded people "retards".
eight points.
you are welcome.
check your pulse rate.
and business class which was basically just coach.
kgb - what the hell was that?
oh, my god.
this is ryan, the new temp.
uh oh!
yeah.
that is... well... i got news for you, albert.
get in the sidecar.
no, no.
that should not be there.
darryl, watch this.
and you know what?
they come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we are all gone, they jack up the prices.
good.
freaks!
uh, coffee order is going around -- on me.
how about some splenda?
do you want to talk about tonight?
tell me what you really think.
i can not wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face.
you mean cancer?
kelly?
who are her co-conspirators?
perfect, well, we are settled.
did your baby draw that?
we liked the last guy, siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist.
yes.
when... damn it.
you are insane.
come here.
working on it.
hate to break it to you oscar but some of us like boobs.
now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life.
there is another woman.
looks like jim got mixed up with some bad apples.
"oh, i think I will just use this line horizontally.
dwight.
just, give her a hug.
please take an agenda item.
but you ruined it.
he is a dunder-mifflin man.
i would do anything for them and they are just hanging me out to dry.
yup.
how do i look?
great job, great laughs.
I will stall him.
three, two, one.
they say it is not different, but it is a different sensation.
mose calls him garbage because he likes to eat garbage.
trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
t-back.
I am just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
oh nope!
no, we can not do that.
i have a song.
i reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
oh, really?
stop it!
greg, hello, it is dwight from the vestibule.
losers.
i want you to take a card.
no one.
but i am still looking for someone with a sales background.
and you are gayer than oscar.
i love it.
good shocks.
huh.
good morning.
have it your way.
wow... oh, wait a second, i can not tonight... tonight's so... too many times.
i said no.
was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
do you want to do this right or not?
one of the cutest little asparagus farms you will ever see.
david, here it is.
okay everyone!
no, no.
and it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with pam.
smoke!
listen up, i need your ideas, now!
.
if a car hit me, it would not crack my pelvis.
jan went crazy.
hey, you are making me spray!
dwight, you have not seen meredith yet, have you?
were you listening to what i was saying?
i think that is how they got a core.
a disease that has largely been eradicated in the us.
hit it andy!
you are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not?
why do not you just resign?
please?

he is pretend and he does exactly as i tell him to.

"what is your name?" michael.
alright.
i was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I am okay with it.
"interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process." "interviewer has suspect motives." "interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior dartmouth." ever heard of it?
are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
michael scott returning.
there are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.

maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?
he did not want to have to struggle to survive.
I am with esther now.
what is in here?
i love you-love you.
that is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.

e.t.
it is rude, and unsexual.
you do not need a mom.
please?
bears sad, worms happy.
can you make yourself cry?
mmm!
in a way.
i suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand.
yeah, we hugged it out.

you down with the dundies?
one time i suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.
yes.
i knew what i was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
no, that is not... no, i went to the mall and i picked that out especially for you.
there is a tradition that the hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
show time, part one.

so that is how it ends.
thank you.
right?
my father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life.
see ya in a bit.
a murder, you say?
come on, people!
hi.
i do not want to do any of that.
the judge is in session.
uh... um, i think you will have fun.
give it to me dwight.
okay, yeah, i dunno.
well if somebody who barely out-sells phyllis, can get in, i should be fine.
we are soul mates.
after an hour, i figured i was in the wrong theatre, but i kept waiting.
so phyllis is basically saying, "hey michael, i know you did a lot to help the office this year but i only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth." i gave ryan an ipod.
i believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as darryl.
alright!
put it down!
right?
we cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
the party I am having tonight in 308. obviously, you are invited.
or, you will suffer the consequences.
so stupid!
too much for me to have by myself.
that is annoyed.
hello, holly.
power couple.
i know you love beet salad.
yaaaaaay, pam!
but you know what else would have been nice?
poopball?
baaaat!
yeah!
you are like an amish return stick.

try my googi, googi.
best friends forever.
give and take.
he is in an all-out sprint.
come on.
well, that is not what I am saying.
no.
sometimes it hurts michael.
michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and - i do not want people making fun of my nose.
oh-oh-oh before you go, I would just love to get a firm commitment on this.
yeah, no such thing.
roasted.
no, no.
i have work up to my ears I am busy, busy, busy.
okay, bags.
let us make a deal.
so i thought we should plant a tree.

the life of the party.
no, i would never leave you for dead.
welcome.
let us look at this.
there is been a murder in savannah.
mmm-hmm.
today is safety training day.
i think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or i will do it for them.
who is michael?
joke's on you because i know morse code.
i know you are the mastermind, but you are too stupid to do it by yourself.
i honestly do not see what the big deal is.
and if we have to defend ourselves, i will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
got it.
well, thank you.
you know when they say it is so crazy it just might work?
if i were joking, you would be laughing.
great work.
that was great.
hey, that looks good.
i do not either.
he is already paying for himself.
you are all my homies you down with the dundies?
andy is never here today.
when i think about all the time i wasted being your friend - i should not have been hanging out watching karate movies with you - you know what, i should have been doing?
ok, I am ready.
creed, kevin, oscar... andale!
oh, here we go, here we go.
yes, i know that.
um... andy and dwight are rockin' the sales team.
you know what?
i did not hear you.
phyllis put you up to this?
i framed a raccoon for opening a christmas present.
because i do not make copies, I am the boss.
all right.
yes.
you know what you should do to be hilarious?
what is up?
got to see how jamaicans live.
i... okay, yeah, that is pretty hot.
i really do.
all right, everybody... oh my god, pam, those make you look so ugly.
it was amazing.
you are welcome!
who here has done something stupid in their lives?
triple your investment by january.
i am going to be better.
oh, god.
okay?
i think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
there are no lines in the parking lot.
turns out, sensei ira was a bit of a shyster.
through these blinds is where i first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and i thought you were the prettiest mover i had ever seen.
i have to be liked.
i will tell you why.
that is strong!
really?
what you want a cookie?
if anything i gave it to her.
translation: there is a madman in our midst.
shake it, shake it!
no.
two separate times you have set me up to believe i was being recruited by the cia.
and nobody calls them restaurants.
really?
this'll be hilarious.
of course i would.
so to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts.
we have more houses to visit.
yeah, i took your purse.
it is very unusual for michael not to show up to work.
okay, okay, okay.
no one knows what the real santa claus... god!
and it is why, i intend on keeping that secret for as long as i possibly can.
pulled off an amazing '80s party last year.
fool me once, strike one.
stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.
a hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
no, jim, hey!
of course i checked it.

what did they say?
very nice.
i only have influence?
but we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex.
he is my best customer.
crisis management squad.
what are you doing?
and you have been an outdoor cat.
excuse me, people.
this is not very clever, jim.
double everything.
attention, employees of dunder mifflin.
this is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
it is not going to solve anything.
I am a very busy man.
my parents left me beside the road.
the crow.
and the sentence, death.
twelve miles an hour.
oh, god.
I will be right back.

fruit.
uh, yeah, it is okay.
misdemeanor?
good.
yes, that too, but i mean with the audio.
i booed someone tonight.
second from the end.
discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.
i bet he knows nothing about boobs.
i think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the michael scott paper company i really enjoyed having lunch with pam and ryan everyday.
you are wrong.
no, I am always good... for some serious buckage.
because if not, i just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
yeah!
no.
hey ryan?
what can i do?
i have a convertible.
okay, everyone!
everyone calm down.
we only lost one pound, phyllis.
"it is ryan the wuphf guy!" "he is up there." look at that!
and just bear in mind when i say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that i, if i were you, that i would not want to hear... well... no, I am not.
it is a colonoscopy.
flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
no.
well, then he is not a senator.
yeah, back off.
no, i do not!
if the people here were our founding fathers, the revolutionary war would have been delayed ten years, because stanley washington was napping, and phyllis hancock was still signing the declaration, and kevin jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
took me years to figure out that it was a con.
yes.
it is stupid.
what hand do you use to answer the phone?
xterra's not even a real word.
i see your voice in the phone.
under this regime, it will not leave this office.
divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood over here right?
boilerplate.
you know what?
i am exclusively big picture, epic.
were they in the missionary position?
wanted to get him oh the places you will go, but they were sold out.
you might want to get to the airport.
i like a little feather in my nuggets.

i dunno.
how about friday?
you know what we should do?
what do i?
you are dead, my friend!
you may have toby.

you got it.
define foment.
mr. kosseli.
and it is about to erupt.
two forty five, behind the building.
absolutely.
okay.
I am wearing my mustard shirt.
looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
what time would you get there every morning?
i have been saying the word "manager" a lot, so whenever jo thinks "manager" she thinks of me.
you are going to drive me crazy.
this...  is a schrute buck.
is it?
no, no, no.
toby is in hr which technically means he works for corporate.
did she spurn your advances?
if-a you change-a you mind, why do not you talk to mikanos?
or lady on her back?
yeah, that is right.
yes, the time has come to name my own replacement.
ha.
let me explain something to you.
i want her tailed.
thanks, michael.
no, no, no.
i do believe that the game is a big hit.
and i can be mature about that.
and what we are all about here in scranton.
never mind, i know it by heart.
here we go.
they are going to have... you can not say that, all right?
i wonder if anybody else would like to do this.
he is very, very handsome.
so I am wise, and i have worms.
no, it is not.
"hidy ho, you sexy thang.
i am actually your boss, michael scott.
when you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end.
well, I am going to wait till the end of the day.
pictures.
ladies and gentlemen!
I am going to need you to let the mailman go.
nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
aaaaaaaa!
horrible.
how are you going to do that?
a bazooka.
so maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
do it now.
this is how business... I am not closing the door.
i need to have her tell me herself.
i carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
kevin has an enormous heart.
I am going to wait.
right here.
so there is that.
yeah.
10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount?
the certificate's a fake.
i can not do it again for a whole new guy.
no.
they are like the golden globes but less mean.
but our, our elevator does not require a pa... have you been introduced to kevin?
well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.
I am all better.
nine.
do you know what this is?
just kidding.
hit him!
cage matches?
oh, man.
put it in.
we take separate cars.
it is really what is best for the branch.
and you know what else, i know you have got coverage under roy and i know that you wrote down those fake diseases.
and i know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office.
so you have 40 boxes going out, and i will deliver those personally in a sebring.
okay.
told it.
dogs, you know, you should know me better than that.
shh.
I am going to stay here and fight.
yeah, no.
that is cool.
whoo.

i was joking about that whole bund thing.
with the halves are cut off.
you can train him.
or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you have been... ever.
i am a grown-up, jim.
so do we just give up?
oh, yes, great.
she thought this was a costume party!
her words, not mine.
ah!
he stretched his pelvic bowl!
let us do that.

un-shun.
and i really want a wife and kids.
so... well no harm no foul.
shame on you.
safer.
so, how you been?
he and the senator are gaying each other.
pam, i am not an unreasonable man.
ok, we will be skins!
yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you are a jackass.
fourteen years.
good to see you.
not a native speaker.
ryan?
in which direction?
i need everything you have got on darryl since he started working for jim in the last few weeks.
no.
can you hear us?
no, no, no.
just the woman I would like to see.
all right!
number one!!
ohhh, what?
please, not at a time like this.
i do not need your help.
he/she/it throat rips.
nice try, josh!
and... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?
you know, there is no easy way to do this.
with the molten hot lava of strategy!
and you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream.
can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today?
mmm!
yes, well.
i know.
really?
highways or surface roads?
dunder mifflin, michael scott, diversity tomorrow, take four.
cancel this one.
just hangin'.
you took something that does not belong to you.
I am very successful... your coworkers look at you differently.
yes?
that was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs.
okay, why not?
ok. ok, ryan, you have darryl.
blood everywhere.
thanks for going out, guys.
twenty-six!
the next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
oh!
who else?
okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.
tonight is the dundies, the annual employee awards night here at dunder mifflin.
oh.
thank vous.
no, no, no.
listen.
make sure you replace the urinal cakes.
derrick, and lefevre, and ben, and ayana, and mikela, and nikki and jason, and... I am sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?
just words.
and uh, it is fine for the time being.
but then no one can see us.
on whom's authority?
we are going to hide.
you have to break the interior bag.
mi-chael!
hi ben, michael scott.
I have done that.
shut it.
they just relax, they party all the time.
wha - no.
there is one more suggestion.
so, how do i do that?
kelly, what about ryan?
you seem suprised.
I am just happy that i got this meeting.
ok, everybody listen up.
at that time, i will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as... whoa.
so can we come in?
so, I am paying full price?
action.
... hello in there?
right there.
no.
who wants to watch michael's pond dive?
it just goes to show, you leave scranton, exciting things can happen.
he slept one night in your car too?
excuse me sir, i took the bus here and was wondering if i could catch a ride home with you in your car.
phyllis!
shh.
give it, give it.
wow, a thousand big ones.
now, i do not know exactly who did it, but i have a list right here...  you should fire the following people.
i am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman i plan to inseminate.
i can not relax in the same corner where i work.
hey, phyllis, do i need this invite to get in to the party?
do not.
they are complimentary.
thank you.
please?
you know?
no more hugging.
i do not know, make something up.
no, whomever is never actually right.
he is supposed to cut his leg off?
i have a new place.
ok, everyone.
there are forty rules all schrute boys must learn before the age of five.
maybe you have got mono.
i want it to be like... "hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "um, well, i do not, i do not know.
you can use those.
i... uh, well, i do not know.
no.
jim, come on.
society does not care.
i had put it on my calendar and pam threw that out.
you know what, i feel like one of those old timey sailors.
an accident borne of jealous feelings.
from this point forward, you will not use the bathroom.
hold on one second.
I am not your father.
genius.
you, my friend, are going to have to be stanley hudson.
and then they stop.
you can not say that everything is perfect.
burning the midnight tequila.
i want to get back.
oh, nicknames, yay!
it was nothing personal.
stanley.
alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we are going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
hey!
pbs.
"r" is among the most menacing of sounds.
well, i ran down meredith in my car.
oh, it is so wet.
no, he is not.
ener-gize... everybody, so how are we going to energize our office?
i do not need the woods.
dwight, dwight... football is like rock and roll, it is just bam-bam-boo... and basketball is like jazz, you know?
this is going to kill kevin.
did i just hear you laughing with glee?
dwight schrute.
you have to agree with me.
this is good.
is that all you have on her?
i had no idea you played soccer.
oh.
no.
well, if that is what i am required to do, i will do exactly that.
okay.
i guess i just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends.
i mean, i have a yacht, so i obviously did pretty well money wise.
nellie nutmeg, come back in here.
that is it?
you mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
... exactly.
ok. excuse me.

we are not done here.
happy birthday, stanley!
yeah, that sounds amazing.
just, shut up.
oh yeah!
mm-hmm.
you know what?
this is just a first fight of many fights we are going to have.
behold.
i know.
but i feel pretty good right now.
there is not going to be downsizing, dwight.
try and destroy the old ways, gabe, well i will not let you.
i am going to be doing something i wrote specifically for toby.
today i did something stupid.
it is weird.
i did not think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it is pretty realistic.
no, no.
it made me laugh when i heard it, but pam got really offended.
that is how workplace tragedies always begin.
okay, every body.
do not we all look skinny?
i sent away for it in july from a catalog.
i know, just sayin'.
do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
just a second.
well i hated it!
justin polznik!
you should go.
shhh!
oh.
all you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers.
um... hey.
oh god.
i am not going back until i fulfill my resolution.
spoil the surprise.

god, i envy them.
it will blow over.
a person who had money, could buy food, person of respect.
toby is leading ours upstairs.

jim's a good kid.
on the count of three, it is showtime.
those people will be ruined.
gryffindor!
oh!
huh?
all righty.
i really should have a tweeter account.
okay?
the day he starts a business.
uh, well, jan did not believe in showing affection, so... sometimes i do not know how to react when a girl touches me.
.
I am staying on the bus.
also kevin.
well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you do not win it.
here we go!
90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.

i played high school softball.
if you are going number one you have got ten more seconds!
my birthday blows.
umm... i have done some very bad things, things of which i am not proud.
good work.
if i could leave you with one thought, remember... it was not me.
ok, i accept it.
roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
"connecticut." and todd packer and i went to this bar and met a girl.
ed truck, who i liked, got decapitated.

you are right, you are right.
well, jim may be lying with his words, but he can not lie with his body.
your heart is a wonderful thing, michael.
question: is there fire wood on the island?
big.
ah, just the stupid leads.
forget it.
see this sign?
thank you!
please hold.
scranton!
so he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid.
what is it?
what is the matter with you?
oh.
might as well be dinner.
must be tough being here with all that going on.
you should come back.
expense reports are a day-to-day item.
okay?
you are so smart.
it is all downbeat, it is in the pocket, it is like...  dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah... du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do.
mary... meredith had a little lamb.
yes.
i... do not.
thank god.
that is a good place to end it.
where did you leave it?
I am going to make you an offer.
where is little man tate?
and this is where we first made love.
the moment she steps off this bar I will be launched into space.
really?
and oh, jim... oh, i have not see you since my accident that i had when i fell- i fell into the pool of acid, eyes first.
I am sorry, we are having our salad.
well, i had to, i mean... kelly was not even... I am sorry.
thank you michael.
are you nauseous?
we are okay, jim!
sue me.
i can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
I am about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent.
dunder mifflin, a great place to work!
yesterday i was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and i gave myself the nastiest shock.
i am downloading some n3p... music... for a cd mix tape... for holly.
yeah.
okay, good.
400-450  sold!
i do not want to do that.
it is me.
just stop it.
of-kay.
boom boom boom boom!
okay.
I would like to see darryl greet people.
jim, this is going to come as no surprise but i know exactly what you are going to say.
just form a line right here.
do you want to talk about?
and my animal deserves a lot of loving.
they are very, very upset with him.
adapt.
you smell like tide detergent.
this had better be terrible.
you again?
twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm.
excuse me.
jim is jealous of me?
shrute!
everquest.
butter.
how come chris rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then i go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to corporate?
the point is, do not listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
people who will help me get an inroad with the gay hispanic community.
so far, these are my leads.
we measured it once... seedless?
stop it!
who did this to you?
and he is leaving a trail of poops?
i know.
I have seen you guys around.
yeah, i a baby daddy.
they are now.
i do not need fresh  air, because i have the freshest air around, a.c. and i do not need wide open spaces.
well i got a little something something.
no, i was being negligent.
yes, phyl?
slept like a baby.
i... <i>love</i> him.
she said that?
moron, if he was there would not be a story.
and the verdict, it was toby.
arrrgggh!
hey!
I will be right back.
um, and 788 not yet replieds.
so, i hired my best friends.
and she is your boss.
well, now suddenly he can see.
remarkable.
good old mose.
you think it was good?
it was very nice.
i went -- i once went 28 years without having sex.
good.
get in your car and drive down here.
you are not his friend, you do not know.
remember the 15-scooper we had last week?
huh.
oh, sure you would.
ah, yes!
that is like.. that is like mr. and mrs. smith crap.
yes, yes.
think abou- think!
get it?
who you dating?
ok, ok... stanley, your team name?
they could be shrinking.
ok, I will stand near you.
brrrp!
stop playing games with me, crawdad.
so greasy, you should just shave all this.
and you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you do not nip this whole employee of the month situation in the bud.
this golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance." the holy grail.
I will have to talk to the manager.
pam.
an office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... an office is a place where dreams come true.
you make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
hey, look at me, I am a baby!
I am good with bosses.
i think it was creed.
yeah, do not do that.
ryan's next.
okay?
much better.
how can i pose this to you in a relatable way?
harlem globetrotter... all right, time, time out.
and pam, you are my wife.
I am buying it and I am not renting it.
hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster?
i will cover his ass like moss on a mississippi tree stump.
oh god, i can not think, need more mullins.
i have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign.
and harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt voldemort's surge of vicious anger.
just eat it, eat it, phyllis.
yeah.
you really want packer as your boss?
mittens.
have a good morning.
now, give my regards to hell.
you either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.
you simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck.
you remember my cousin mose.
biggest of your life.
yeah, i think that is pretty boss.
that - it is, it is more of a disco.
thank you.
i do not know.
I will remind you.
what box?!
schrute farms is very easy to find, it is right in the middle of the root vegetable district.
the pewter package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it is still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats.
got it for ryan.
i also saved her life, but i guess that is not as grabby.
okay.
yours does not.
say it again.
so what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit.
this is... my home.
good to see you.
the only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him.
that is a tough crowd.
so what was rule two?
there is one that sounds like a jackhammer.
and nobody paid any attention.
I am public speaking.
that is a hero.
just a second.
please.
what else?
you can not even protect her!
give me the phone.
why is not it in my hand?
and she is, like, three feet tall.
stop it!
i was walking in and i noticed something shinny under stanley's car and i got under to see what it was and i messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
I am just lucky i got out.
phyllis, look at-  okay, that is...  all right, all right.
jim carrey did not just walk in, ok. you can not see... you can not see my stomach.
do not even think.
come on, big guy.
like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
we have... a bat... in the office.
it is just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
that is too much peanut butter.
so since you guys already ate, you will not be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?
ooo, bleh bleh bleh.
but i can teach you enough so that you do not embarrass me or the company.
there was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye.
you are smart, capable.
perfectinschlag.
i guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment.
i find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
let us go, fall out, let us go.
let us go!
i really like you.
he either proposes by new year's or they break up.
shunning resumed.
this one's for you cherokee jack.
no, no, no.
I am not wearing a wire, so... how much?
you are a very handsome man, get in the car.
i am 99% sure.
no further questions.
what do you mean?
he wrapped his belt around his own neck.
by hand.
and i picked... the... former.
ok everybody, listen up.
question, should i get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
do not go there.
... no, I am catholic, too.
plus perks, yes.
I am worried about erin, because she is not a very good worker.
damn it!
i finally broke down and bought myself a plasma tv.
stop stop stop stop stop stop.
and I am very angry, and i want... I am going to kill you.
i got it.
no.
your pay is just different.
i sure do.
thank you, kevin.
we have always had good christmas parties here, as you know, but they have never been cool.
who cares?
thank you so much.
oh!
can you hold it in your hand?
i will not need to because we will be together playing hooky.
oh...my god!
so when i say I am sorry, it will be twice as effective.
this is not as much fun as i thought it would be.
i mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion... right.
blow.
while i was away, jim had my desk shipped to me in roswell.
ohhh, god.
all in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?
yes.
i do not have a second job.
no, it is not weird, andy, and you know what else?
do i have your permission to invite carol?
wow!
yah!
oh.
hungry for success.
he is lying.
it is seems like ya did though- jim.
i just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I would drop in and say hello.
oh, thank you.
ethical.
i, um, I am out the door.
okay, i have to fire somebody.
not in a speech.
okay, you know what that is?
i am sick over this thing.
when i was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... i worked side-by-side with a fellow named todd packer, and together we rocked the office .
whatever you want.
...  it is a million-dollar sale.
what am i gong to do?
oh kay, mind is exploding.
can i give you a piece of advice?
what is this, a meatball?
that was not so hard.
best dundies ever.
come on over.
here we go!
it is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here.
and i threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish.
there you go.
and remind them what is great about this place.
kevin.
no, no.
anybody wants to stay out, you have got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
this is official police line tape, okay?
and my new favorite restaurant sucks... i bought a video camera last year, and i was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that i felt was worth taping the whole year.
when things sort of get hard.
the late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.
uh, I am not a moron.
well, dwight, he wiped his butt.
i did not joke with any of them, i joked with you.
how do you like that?
no!
go ahead.
webster's dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch.
you made me wrap it.
all right, how about some presents?
really?
this year i decided to really get into the spirit of halloween.
but now?
what are you wearing?
if you want to dump me, i totally get it.
ok. alright, after you.
pussy.
hank, hank!
a lot of people in the room, need more space?
it does not sound like much, but its enough for me.
you know, i may have underestimated you.
no, they are with me, so... this is nick figaro, manager to the stars!
just do your best!
not about taking credit.
impressive.
you do not have to tell them.
wow, that is great.
from 2:30 to 3:15.  it is the only time that bob was available.
he would come in and sit there sometimes.
oh.
wait, salesaEUR"what sales meeting?
stanley, no, I am going to handle the cord.
no.
high score?
angela.
can you do that for me?
troops.
it is like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
um, then he went home to what is now formerly yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him.
and action.
no, guys, guys, guys.
a robot.
did you check it?
the sting.
the family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
solving a mystery, if that is quite alright with you.
surprise!
i just wanted... i just wanted to do it our way.
how do i put this delicately?
it is ju- they did not have any more businessmen.
morning announcements!
no, this is about the right size.
why do not you enliven me?
beat that!
look, i know that i screwed up in there.
I will take it from here.
cage match!
have you seen erin?
next suggestion.
no.
shhh.
wha... here is the thing, jim is the best man for this job, i think you should give it to him.
ok, umm, could i just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
it- yep, recently.
a boss and a money cruncher.
it would!
hey kevin, you are a gambler right?
bang!
he is in his knickers.
do i regret this?
alright.
crap!
yes.
hey clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like.
pam.
go get her.
and, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law.
four.
burned this last night.
you are older, and you are very happy now.
last year i bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger.
okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
so what do we know about her?
ok, good.
you know what?
I am not going to help you.
how you doing?
no!
and you know how all waitresses look alike.
he is trying to get big bad dwight to she will out for a huge repair job while lucky jimbo gets a paid vacation.
look at him.
okay, question.
everything.
you are good.
holly!
that is not true.
yes.
who enjoys the weekends?
come on please!
dwight, do you mind if we talk?
friends with a hobbit.
that is a picture!
can you help me please, I am being crushed.
just-in case.
like, with who?
sounds good.
instead, it has become like when my mom moved in with jeff.
yes i did.
everyone here is extremely gruntled.
i think i garner people's respect.
yeh.
aw, cramp, I am just- I am sorry, i fell down, mr. balance.
but what some of you might not know is that i am also part native american indian.
do not know where it goes, but it is home to me and i walk alone.
i do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out.
uh... it will be fun you should give them a call.
spoiler... alert.
nobody cares.
look at you, i bet you break up with a guy every hour.
ryan, you are my son.
you pound, you beg, dwight!
i heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
think these guys are nice?
I am turning in my badge.
the door to my shelter.
yup.
and they freak out.
i was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
you are very charming.
nice.
ha!
listen to me!
continuing.
I am a dad!
you hear stories about dunder mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was.
jim, come on.
it is not over.
let us go.
oh do not raise your voice to me!
i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and i want to show you... there we go!
and we have an eternal struggle, you and i. and only one of us can be the winner.
i do not know, i do not know about that.
okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
what did people believe in before?
that is, that is true.
draw his penis.
look, dwight is a wuss.
well i can, but i will have to come back later tonight and pay you.
everybody ready?
the weak always bully the strong.
what a weird thing to say.
do not!
depression quilt?
kelly, look at me!
give me the phone.
i know all that.
the customer is always right.
you write your sandwich on it.
there is something wrong with everybody in here.
hey, everybody look, pam.
ever since angela moved in and mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he is been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
whassup!
it is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes.
we are proud of you.
this is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
you were right the first time.
you should be the motivational speaker.
that is terrible... terrible news for both of us .
all right.
well, word of advice: unbutton that top button.
i would say that she raised me, but let us not kid each other.
well, kids today have a very short attention span.
you know what?
michael!
and i nevah got caught, neither.
fine.
i want you to fire me, and i will take it.
and he was laughing.
undistributable.
but not like this.
she has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in scottsdale.
hey.
what?
and I am going to go get me a new york slice.
it is like, a girl says she will make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
let us not be gloomy here man.
i say go for the air-tight plan and that is why i am having andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.
they determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
i do not even consider myself a part of society.
listen up!
no, it is an accountability booster.
zing and pep, see that is those are the kind of words we are looking for.
yes... just go- oh.
so let us meet the warehouse!
wait, you want this kid to be in the air force?
that is it.
had a very good thing going with david wallace.
no, you do not even know what stupid is.
i got us tickets to sandals, jamaica, we leave day after tomorrow.
uhhh it is ridiculous.
okay, he can have 14. marjory's not here today.
what do you think you are doing?
she tells me to stop.
i take quincy ave to gibson.
attention everybody.
first, i would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
sometimes i spend too much time volunteering.
michael scoon, fbi.
i-i-ugh, ok. all right.
that is how it works.
should i trust jim?
with a rep from hammermill.
just some bushes and some thickets  keep going.
they are delicious.
so, i got this bucket from jim's garage and i filled it with everything disgusting.
are there any words you would like to say, on pam's behalf?
okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and stanley's got way more body fat than they do.
had them run a background check on josh porter.
how do i feel about breaking up with donna?
it is a fake wheel, dummy.
my right one's falling asleep a little bit.
i do not get it.
all right!
i do not understand why you keep picking on me.
good, let  them.
i... all right.
yes.
wait a minute, wait a minute.
has anyone ever come up to you and said, "you are not creative"?
enter sandman, metallica.
excuse me, I am sorry, but that is not all it takes to be a hero.
for you... jerk.
um... could somebody grab me the lever, and i will... yeah, get your hazards on for safety.
no!
hello, little man.
easy.
we do not take debit cards, anyway.
... yes.
i believe you may recognize his face from the billboards.
we are, uh, we are doing okay.
let us go, step it up you runts.
come on, i know, you have got so much on your plate.
no, i did not.
ends.
hey little girl, what would you like for christmas?
i do.
i took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
come on!
go slash his tires!
uh-huh.
i carry mints with me sometimes.
you are 58 years old?
no, you were not stupid.
this is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.
oh, she is great.
what is that?
god bless you.
they have him surrounded.
yes.
come on!
i do not know... i might just be a basketball machine.
there never was any gum.
oh, no.
mr. franklin, i would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
okay, I will talk.
they will cost you your life.
knock, knock.
still waitin' on that coffee.
now i can not pay for your college.
seductive.
pam, put that in my good idea folder.
bye.
stanley, got to play hurt.
everyone, you heard me!
i... this is creed.
i thought you had some kind of big master plan.
you could be the indian bill gates.
what was... if he had just waited and heard what i had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
they are "appearance"ists!
so why do not you just go stand somewhere else.
that is crazy talk!
he is hard of -- he is an old man.
ah, my skin, ow, ow!
and frankly, the stuff that we are into is not very condo-appropriate.
and you can take it, no hard feelings.
everybody else here did.
be respectful, dwight.
oh, come on.
pam says hi.
this is perfect.
ok, i am really going to do this.
it is true.
hey!
anybody hear anything?
not now, temp.
it will take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill michael scarn.
you are going to end with "etcetera"?
right, toby?
jim will not sign my expense report.
paper is the manure!
and then i call froggy 98.7, the request line.
would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?
ok, oscar, i do not need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
what if we went in as a greek couple?
and we are through with it.
you are going to watch me right?
it is totally impossible!
no revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself.
huhhhhh!
... no, he did not!
what is going on, michael.
flirt away.
what is her name?
take care of that, all right?
improv class, i have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds- yeah.
I will show them.
where is my go bag?
we could do a movie... sort of thing.
kevin, stay.
"abdomen.
here we go!
did i want to be made manager?
yeah.
i mean, broad strokes purposes, sure.
stop public interrupting me.
see you later.
hey, where are you going?
oh, its just stanley's old photo album.
and if not acceptance, then just depression.
oh, there is one mistake.
this company does not waste time or resources, ever.
and never- do- well siblings to take care of.
jim taking the initiative.
and.
so i guess this will just be my office.
i need you to do something for me.
hello?
like... i do not... i do not know.
get up.
what is the purpose of this meeting?
so creative.
how would one of you feel if i told you i could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
I am sure he had his reasons.
welcome.
tender love is blind-- we are making love!
dwight schrute.
going to head out.
it- it- i already have my european girlfriend.
hey, i do not get no respect.
managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life.
yes!
that is not the way i heard it.
oh... oh, man!
the days are short.
toby!
yeah, a little bit.
but, I am sort of an expert at photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end.
so we at sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
yes, yes.
this is kevin malone, is david there?
i will do my <i>regional manager</i> job to the best of my <i>cap</i>ability.
okay.
ahh!
mr. schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk.
hey, first guest!
stop it!
like i sold you on the idea that my father had died.
okay, you know what?
right?
i want you to make the decision so I am not the bad guy.
let us just clap.
what other ghost stories do you have for us?
i got one.
ugh!
hey, what time is it?
it was... it was never my intention to ruin a life.
you are the bait for toby?
he was later diagnosed with dementia.
where is the bug?
get out of my way.
and it blows.
i plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere.
what?
ahh, still lame.
uh, pam, one more thing.
and then i had an awakening.
i... was just learning... to... love.
you need an attack plan.
and the talent agent says, "describe your act." and the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "what do you call yourselves?" and the man says, "the aristocrats!" i mean truly repulsive acts.
but you are getting written up.
i need a box.
okay.
there is a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.
there is a decision that needs to be made, and I am having an unbelievably a busy day.
yeah, alright, so i want you to give him your undivided attention and mr. franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave i give you permission to spank them.
ryan?
um... yes, in a way.
goodbye my friend.
some people just do not want to be inspired.
if it is not stop and shop, i send it back.
where would we even drop it, phyllis?
what are our plans for tonight?
look at how long it took for him to find out.
no idea where creed came from.
what did he say?
i know, i know.
two years in a row.
ha, ha, ha, ha.
it is already been stolen this round.
wish me luck.
okay, let me tell you a little story.
um, look.
split the difference.
cock in the henhouse.
was i not supposed to say it?
dwight.
he does not know anything about property ownership.
oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
hey.
who knows?
was anyone killed?
too embarrassing for you?
uh-huh.
oh, no!
this is the guy that beat the computer.
they have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free.
thank you so much.
i would make sure that you were dead.
but your face does look like the guy from operation.
packer.
three demerits and you will receive a citation.
excellent.
really?
there will be no leftovers.
sorry.
i thrive on this.
i am not going to finish.
i have made a very sizable donation to oscar's nephew's... walkathon.
hey.
what have we here?
you are going to break something.
all grown up and no place to go.
you are so weak.
remember from your wedding?
what?
here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
it is a summer christmas sale-abration.
yes.
uh, I will drive.
mmm... okay.
ok, alright, enough with the jokes.
allow me to share.
six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes.
I am going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
I am michael.
ow!
it is not even to "y".
according to a 2004 study!
you?
and now dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
come on man, got to step it up!
perfect.
so it does.
can you believe he would never heard that before he worked here?
barbara keebis.
ready?
please!
hahahaha.
no, no, no, no.
i think we... go together so well.
they are all good.
agreed.
ahhh!!
I have written quite a bit of x-men fan fiction.
I have never had one.
well... you... you... you are as creepy as a real serial killer.
get out of the way!
but he is also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he is ready to explode.
we are going out of business!
she was very hot.
I am not going to be okay.
really?

they can move much more efficiently.
maybe some italian.
check it out.
one for the road, gentlemen?
i am a mere defender of the office.
and now, the chains.
and i can prove it.
jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances.
on his mother's grave.
dwight!

in an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain.
gotcha!
t.m.i.
dwight?
cow surfing.
you are sure it was water, it could not have been acid?
nope, it will not be gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to luke.

spicoli guy.

a great opportunity squandered?
oh my--!
come on.
all luck must be wished unto michael.
they are rushed to the hospital.
thank you.
vice president, uh, who is that?
andy!
thank you.
this was no act of god.
maybe you have some kind of bladder infection.
i just want to say, this is not my fault.
just, let us do secret santa.
do not.
uh, you are foir-ed." it just makes people sad, and an office can not function that way.
where did you get your outfit?
oh, wow!
plus i will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard.
stanley, as a fellow dunder mifflin employee i feel for you.
do not excite him.
oop, backspace.
remember how hot she was?
oh, i think it is going to work out great.
what are you doing here?
he is alive.
ben franklin.
i will not let you down.
well, that is baloney, because grief is not wrong.
you want help?
an african-american father of two, stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we are hoping to build our bases on.
my last physical when i was forty.
mmhmm.
yes.
bogy at 3 of the clock.
no.
oh... there is a god, and he has a plan for us after all.
ow, ow, aahch!
it is bad taste.
so, i respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.
yes, i will.
hoo hoo!
ok. that is not... i really hope so.
i did a lot more than wave.
god!
we are not selling.
terrific.
thank you.
well, i hope this conversation has helped.
not playing favorites.
i wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
or melons.
making s'mores?
here come the sharks.
i wonder if she wants a snack.
they are unreadable.
jim, let go.
well, hang in there, okay?
deck the halls with crappy gifts... yeah, except for cheating on your wife.
if you break that girl's heart, i will kill you.
aaaaaaaa!
okay, oh okay, okay.
I am not going to say it.
this is going to be a very good year.
idiot.
while we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, i wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
come on!
i always thought darryl and pam might get me fired for something i said.
that is, whatever stupid show you want- to watch tonight we are watching it.
maybe we should test it first.
oh, great.
mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
what about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
where did you get that mallard?
that, that is unfair!
i think it does.
all right, guys, come on, let us bring it in!
what did you do?
when you have somebody is attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and i experienced that firsthand today.
good trip down?
no.
oh, good.
that-that was maybe too much.
they are going great.
front row.
beets are the worst.
all right, i am so proud of all of you.
okay.

but it works.
here he is.

hey, pam yeah, i forgot what day the interview was and i drove to new york accidentially.
just hitting "door closed." what?
how long is this going to take?
get your own white out.
good luck finding a new job idiots.
i just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
well, i am in america and i am online, so i do think it involves you.

for... drum roll, please , the official merger day all-family welcome breakfast.
irrelevant.
this morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers i earned my black belt in goju ryu martial arts.
right, but 20 years ago we could not and that is amazing.
by wanting it more.
I am going to go back in.
shoot.
god!
start pretending to do work."  what a jerk.
oh!
it takes a big man to admit his mistake.
you know why?
the bubble wrap is the only thing that is stopping his suit from getting wrinkled.
jim, dwight, please excuse us.
okay.
we both reserve the right to go to jo if we disagree with gabe.
let us do some good.
well i believe in love at first sight.
today is the big day that i am heading to new york to attend a party with sushi and important people.
it is not the only drug that speeds people up.
here is a helpful suggestion for jim.
you can count on me.
thank you!
i think the meetings are very important.
she is your wife, you idiot.
now you may look around and see two groups here.

I am going to go back to work.
let us take him-- let us go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
if you want to tell me - oh no!
do you use tide detergent?
diversity tomorrow, take five.
having luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. the last time i saw luke was the opening day of 'ace ventura ii' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot.
you know, i want this to be cutting edge.
that is why everybody... well, it is part of it, it is just the... uhhh.
please, please.
I am still recovering.
bad idea jeans.
i would like you to go to my mother's house in dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, i want you to boost yourself up, i want you to go down to the basement.

horse boat.
later guys.
it is a tightrope for babies.
not by a long shot!
let us get vanilla.
that was not meant for me.
you know what time it is?
what do you mean?
you know what i think we should do?
she bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she is got to be kind of nervous.
it has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office.
so if i were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
come on!
well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot.
and he signed!
i forgot about packer.
really?
i saw you program it in.
that question makes you sound gay.
you came up with this idea.
rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
i was asleep.
ready?
i love women.
no, i do not want to do that because I am twice your size anyway.
then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.
you know, just a little bit of money.
come in.
do not go.
just put it on.
we just-we wanted to know your tricks.
i missed, i missed the important part again!
this is hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
I have never- i do not know him.
talk about you know who.
do not say cocks.
whassup.
yeah, totally single.
oh, calm down, weirdo.
and... when we have a good quarter, fireworks?
a joke.
the electric city.
sounds like fun.
you go talk to him.
I will tell ya what I am going to do.
packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the pyramid.
that is the problem.
you two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
mr. buttlicker.
pizza by alfredo.
he is scummy.
whacky pack.
there are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
jan and i had love.
oscar, $14.75.
hm mm.
just have a thought.
give it to me.
yes.
like when i promised those kids I would pay for college.
that is the third time and it was not funny the first two times either jim.
took about an hour.
i want it.
so it is a matter of interest.
sure, sounds good.
good news.
well, i know a guy.
it is me.
pam beesley.
you win.
listen, listen, stanley.
my god, what have they been teaching you?
hey.
no reason.
no.
can not say that I am sorry.
why are you so negative?
we did?
you know what?
who is the king of prussia?
poor little guy.
okay, how is it going in here?
i brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
you talking about hunting?
no, you may not.
they were engaged, so...  okay, you know what, sir?
as if you had a choice.
no, i can not talk to her.
do not sell your implants please.
que?
although born just minutes from here, he speaks only german.
he did not tell the truth a lot.
do i have a nickname on the court, um?
no, that was my sensei.
okay, good.
ready?
i do not know.
ok?
thanks, i had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there was not a concussion.
pam, this is not a shopping trip.
ok, you know what?
ok. watch out kelly, he might sucker punch you.
oh, shoot.
get back to me.
yeah!
mmhmm.
yeah!
come on.
space heater and fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
umm... let us see... choo choo choo.
okayaEUR  one thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide  i am going to generate myself into a human trap.
because if so, you are succeeding.
is packer here?
acting!
I will never outsell jim and pam without one.
moved ryan over to your desk.
i also stole something off of her computer.
i do not want any special treatment, pam.
very nice.
thank you for asking.
wait a second.
i am incommunicado, capisce?
so... oh.
hey, how you doing?
um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
yes, michael.
i do not know.
hello?
they filled the balloon with pee.
ah, it is just easier to say t.m.i.
chicken fight!
really, really went after my intelligence there.
he looks worse.
what?
a little "good will hunting" situation.
well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
all right?
i will also never be less happy.
amazing.
for the kinder in a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time.
i thought that you might say that.
net.
it is like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away.
he is very very smart, and funny, and charming... you know, i can not do it, toby is the worst.
boundaries, dwight.
what is pam doing chatting with you?
call it the holy spirit or the passion of the christ.
yes!
it is comfort food, all right?
all right, we are set.
hey, stanley.
yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails.
yeah, it is routine.
but you know, life is about more... than just salaries.
who is that monkey?
oh!
tell her I am busy.
so keep it going.
i love him.
kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
probably why he was not hired.
because that is gross misconduct and... just clean out your desk.
how you doing?
you can make another dress that goes past your feet.
are you serious?
well, not exactly.
d'oh!
i thought it would either be an 'a' or an 'a+' but i completely forgot that there is an 'a++'.
but you come inside... and it is beautiful.
yeah... what is wrong with you?
i got gum in my hair.
why do you lie, liar?
that is it!
it is only meredith.
i talk about a lot of things, holly!
remember her?
right, i know paper, i know how to manage.
my shadow's the only one that walks beside me.
well, shall we begin?
all right.
I am a big fan of anything joe rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.
we get them.
i leave you here with my watch, and i come back later to pay for the hot dog.
seriously.
that is a good point.
somebody put a piece of gum in there.
there we go.
i was thinking of proposing to esther today.
damn straight.
and this... is meredith's card.
what shape?
stanley was attacked by his own heart.
i do not want you to go.
so i have decided I am going to dismiss my employees.
wha- what?
oh, i see, you are chickening out on me.
pac-man I am not your lover!
do you understand that?
the point I am trying to make with all of this people is that i hate drugs.
I am sick of this place.
no, no, no.
re-shun.
yes, yes.
totally smashed.
titanic?
people will draw unfair conclusions about martin and or black people.
good-bye!
yep, all right.
okay, we will talk to michael directly.
no, no.
i am the creative genius.
you are not off to a very good start, bernard.
and then type it up, in a way that is helpful.
dwight's rights.
now, a lot of people say that kelly is one in a million and that is true, but it is also not true.
phyllis, can you do this?
i would just find an excuse to come here so i could stare at you through that window.
yes, we did.
can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
no!
i could murder him.
two of those, that will land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
oh, as fire marshal i would have to.
the winner of today gets my job.
you ready for this?
she made me do a lot of things i did not want to do.
toby flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry.
gardner!
that was still about me.
i want to remind everyone the true meaning of christmas.
it is january what do i do?
well, can we overcome these differences?
geography joke.
i have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.
very fair and very kind.
eight?
no.
cool.
do you mean it?
if a vampire bat was in the you.s., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." like penn-sylvania.
so let us make this the best dundies ever.
so i need you to do some work on the st. andrews account.
you do not have to point to the fact that we are thinking about it.
get the plate number.
oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down.
I would like to see a menu please.
i work too hard.
you are lucky i do not have my crossbow!
hey hey!
you will now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables.
I am getting out of town.
tell her i hit a cat.
no.
listen up!
andy bernard.
dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
tah, come on dwight.
I am hungry.
that is why it worked.
well, you came on the day of our christmas party.
want to get some fresh blood.
ok?
i got it.
an office is for not dying.
as far as i can tell, I am the best-looking person here.
i live in a fantasy world.
kind of a good news bad news there.
mmhm.
yeah, maybe I will never be manager, but i just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and i must say, it is the most pleasant I have ever seen stanley.
grasp wrist as such.
really?
pam will be eye candy.
here is my card.
things get ruthless!
oscar night.
we have never met each other.
give me the phone.
it is called willy wonka and the chocolate factory.
wrong.
okay, she needs to be serviced.
no.
idiot.
from now on, when I am hungry, i am going to eat whatever i am hungry for.
i have snow tires and chains.
i want a do-over.
no-- we are all unstable.
yeah jim.
they are a small company.
but boy, that erin.
aaaarrhh!
no, toby, this is different.
they patch me through to his secretary.
and then again for seven years.
hey pam, i have a very important job for you we are.
oh my god.
okay, you are done.
and if this does not bother them, then i am out of ideas.
"sorry i did not write back sooner; i can not go to the game tonight because my boss michael is an ass and making me stay late."  well, stanley's an ass.
i understand.
know who gave me this?
$180!
cookie.
there is two more.
far too many died.
coconuts for your coconuts!
you guys would love it.
no, I am just poopin'.
that is why we got to catch him.
he said he would do the same for me.
who wants a drink?
i am not going to be proposed to in the break room.
you were late.
your dentist's name is crentist.
this is not dunder mifflin paper.
just relax, ok?
i cut them off fresh this morning!
the hero got the girl.
what can, you can not even afford anything now, right?
ugh.
i present to you...the alamo!
i spread the rumor that somebody here was a j. crew model, and i was referring to myself.
why?
yes.
boom!
she, she looked a lot like tina fey.
funny story: the way that i got into improv was, i got into improv.
i do not care.
that... no, no, no.
oh, because there is a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
you are on a roll.
better torque.
wait, what is that i hear?
what?
ok, fine.
baaah!
let us move!
um, easy.

that is my new maintenance worker, nate.
I am heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born.
front and center.
did i happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
I am not giving you the answer.
maybe.
hello?
whoo!
and talking to them today, i do not feel for them anything like what i feel for you.
do you?
uh, no, no, no gould.
yeah, right here.
was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
so, fyi, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template.
"kelly kapoor spent april 1995 to december 1996 at berks county youth center." juvie.
alright, come on.
I am going to do it.

I will be back.
kelly.
david, i did not tell her.
since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
prideful idiots.
the decision to turn on michael was difficult.
well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you would like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I will use it as i would a wagon on my farm.
several times.
it is not a sex ed class.
hmm.
not like wham-bam-thank ya madam.
michael, can i get you something?
god!
uh, she works in the annex.
it could be done out of hate.
child's play.

come in the conference room and i will show you a finished sausage.
oh... yes.

racism is bad.
and i was about to take her bra off... ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork- no!
i love you, kelly.
it is suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I will have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you will be sitting there like an idiot.
i just got a call from debbie brown over at the mill.
why?
i just want to hang out, just be one of the guys.
ok, shut up.
this is my grandmother's buttock bullet ring.
what is going on?
all right, all right, I am on a roll.

sorry again.
come back, come back.
today is about herpes.
here.
i will never be happier than i am right now.
I am calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.
i want people making out in closets.
yeah, you do not want italian.
phyllis, how is the rabies quilt coming?
and yet i really like him.
tell me, a.j., are you dating?
that was a different guy.
i will not.
listen, jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what i want is more important that what you want.
blagh!
in that case, war was the right choice.
he was...okay at it.
your job is to make the office lame.
one home run and you are out.
yeah that sounds good.
that was awesome!
wow.
inside the house.
it is about you.
okay, a little about me.
the shards of glass would have shaved her face right off.
no.
they are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, michael scott is freaking cool.
man, work can be just so damn frustrating do not ya think, jim?
look, i need your advice on something.
is the milk clumpy?

uh huh.
life-size.
i always work out without my clothes.

we could do it in the warehouse.
oh hey, jim.
i have a girlfriend so... yeah she probably, yeah she would be.
hoo-ooh!
nice.
i- i have no words.
i really understand it.

higher volume.
that is a drive!
this is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings.
i got dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do.
stop that.
you sit down, you are supported.
hi, jerry.

i know, i know.
number one: you need to play to win.
i liked her jumpers.
I have always heard that british columbia is a very nice place, but i am not getting that from this conversation.
carol.
well, i never thought I would see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
the elderly suck the life out of the young.
the guys i did not bring are even better.
I would go with the rows.
it is been a long time since we have come down here separately.
tomorrow.
i know she did not do it.
come on, I am sure there is something you need to get off your chest.
jim, jim, jim.
do you have any blonde women?
then i will call david wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
eh.
kiss ass.
and for what it is worth i think your baby voice is tops.
last year, i came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag.
okay, that is enough.
hey, this office needs a strong man.
because i look at somebody like jim halpert and i think, that guy can do anything he wants to do.
he is explaining why we are here, what we are doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... then he is going to have andy repeat a bunch of stuff.
no, that is huge.
hey santa!
so what did i miss?
what do you mean by "these people"?
speaking of rainbows, oscar... you are kind of a double minority.

acrimonious.
michael scarn shoots and then asks questions later.
ryan, come on.
hey.
$100 a day, plus expenses.

why would anybody find that offensive?
save the receipts.
not today, kevin.
no!
what is wrong with me today!?
what do you think?
wow, you will be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
no, i will seduce her.
smart baby.
they say that no man is an island.
hi.
ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it is own sake.
but do not cross me.

he totally misses, interception.
I have seen enough.
well... that is my watch.
do not drop the soap!
jim, you win.
all right.
thanks everybody.
angela where is angela?

excuse me, mr. wallace?
maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.
you can do it.
i just do not know what we would do.
maybe wee find some wiggle room?
anyone employed by the gettysburg industrial complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the battle of schrute farms.
but you bought it!

am i right people?
pam.
where is the funny?
to think that a man's skin could turn on him.

and apparently, some people throw up.
that is going to help things, just talk it out.
and i am back, in the form of a new company.
i can test anyone randomly, and i have chosen you randomly.
okay.
I am thinking about getting something german, something with decent gas mileage.
you know what?
the electric city.
all day.
check one more time.
chairs wear out faster, it takes more freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive bms bust the rivets on my pipes.
everything's under control.
nice.

hmm?
the best way to learn is by watching.
okay, yeah.
oh, wow!

i think we could have done better than that.
well, well.
no!
that is politics baby.
na?
why do not you bring erin to balance you out?
you all skedaddled way too soon.
why do not you hold out your hand.
that stinks!
all you do is dress fancy and sing.
easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
so, basically, i want to do something nice for my employees.
as you know, i like to begin each day with an inspirational quote.
so you are pmsing pretty bad, huh?

i need to buy paper.
what do you do?
okay.
how many times have i told you?
hey.
i feel sorry for those people.
I am not a bad person, i bring good news.
why privately?
i know everything about film.
all right.
guilty.
they are a set.
wait, that is it?
she is pam's best friend.
let us discredit these rumors.
this is too important.
michael, i find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out.
or the other sandals, jamaica.
okay.
... that i would have made.
i need to make nellie see me as a leader today.
you know experiencing freedom.
spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.
i guess angela's kind of... angela's little.
i want to see the baby.
let us start... from the ground <i>up</i>.
mm-hmm.

or none of you i wish i could hire all of you.
awww!
let me tell you something.
listen man, i, i got a problem, i think I am in trouble with the mob.
you think that is good?
that is true.
well, you let me run the company?
woo!
albeit bored.
you are dead, you are dead, you are dead.
okay, rude.
nothing wrong with this stuff.
nah.
get out!
$30,000?
reservations are at 8:00, so we have got like an hour and 45 minutes.
hi.
you are like a giant walking salami!
this is what i thrive on.
because martin luther king is a hero of mine.
okay, security tapes were stolen, motives-financial, or possible, vintage hp computer collectors.
i only did it because i nailed the wave.
so guys, guys, guys.
it was not that long ago.
this is a shared wall.
stop talking.
do not worry, michael.
we just picked the best one right?
nooo!
where is he going to park?
probably not.
work for corporate, with january it would be awesome.
i think i left my wallet in my car.
everybody!
i mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing.
for what?
ryan?
my idea!
whoops.
i sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.
hello, jo.
i do not care, i do not show up.
good!
shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical.
ok. first test.
what if we do not want to use a blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
no.
thanks a lot, man.
okay.
swingers.
right here, I am going to put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.
let us face it, most guys are from the dark ages.
that is actually anti-what we are doing.
that is what i thought.
well i wrote them down so i would not forget.
now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so i can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast.
[lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in michael's office.
are you enjoying your mineral water?
no signs of life down here.
jethro tull... i need to make a sales call.

well, phooey on that.
closure.
really?
hey, you want to win?
do you accept my withdrawal?
people, wait, wait, wait.
just, dwight, do it.
that is insane.
i was in love with you.
have a seat.
there is not going to be downsizing dwight, ok?
oscar, you are- okay, you know what?
I am his boss actually.
like everything i said and everything they did and... just do not... well write it down before you forget it.
that is not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
even though she is a pretty unimportant client, really.
they are awesome.
what do you got?
see you around.
i took charge.
oh, and the petting zoo closes at 2:00, and the goat roast is at 3:00. come on in, enjoy!
the whole business is changing.
it is not going to be tacky, deli platter food.
uncool.
oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?
hi stranger!
great.
i do not get to wear my ties.
now, if she is engaged, I am going to go crazy, and I am going to start attacking people.
thank you!
because i do not want it getting back to sabre that we are yelling at assistants.
i said stop.
can i be team manager?
let us hear it for me!
our first item up for bids tonight is something that i consider to be very boss indeed.
for instance, why do not you go to business... stop.
you tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
are you kidding me?
please.
oh, my god.
what started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
come on.
you finding everything okay?
says you are a security threat?
oh, do not worry.
as has ryan.
kay.
shhh, I am just trying to figure out what is going on in that room, okay?
dwight!
andy, would you like to have my baby?
do you mind?
ok. ok. a-ha-ha!
and i can not help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "how could they do this to us?" it is not... nevermind.
you... are... kidding me.
there was a terrible war, ugh, so many died.
got it.
it was a good idea, though.
give it a whirl.
sixty - forty.
let us just forget it.
okay, no no, I am going to pass, I am going to pass.
that is sorta secondary.
how about that?
this is darryl philbin.
i... you know... it is uh... all i want is somebody nice and sweet and someone i can talk to and share an experience with, you know?
what?
kinky!
let us blow some minds here.
yeah, small.
i show her an image that turns her on.
and i would survive.
we are going to jump in the air.
anything.
i do not get that, i do not understand that.
i do not know.
makes your job superfluous.
can i be team captain?
yeah, she does - she loves purple.
several people are injured.
that was helping.
please.
oh... yes.
you told toby that creed has a distinct old man smell?
actually, um...  sir, I am going to need take this chair.
they are hazel.
michael.
you have a stockholder meeting coming up and you are going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.
drive.
yeah, sure.
they say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of america.
stop it now, god.
hmm.
oh, thank you.
wait, what?
I am not james franco.
hey, mom, I am thirsty!
aah!
alright, do you mind if it sit this out?
the client never knew any of that, but i knew.
if there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
i know.
the way they are programmed... you are mocking me.
hmmm?
I am going to wear what was once one of my pant legs.
okay, toby?
that is great!
does anyone want to trade?
i do not know.
"dear dwight, by now you have received my note.
try "michael scott".
y el accento, donde are you from?
my name is mikanos.
i can not.
ha.
yes!
problem solved.
hey.
he cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned!
it is better than i imagined it!
keep it moving.
yeah, why not?
no.
it is really incalculable.
what are you talking about?
ah!
ugh, alright.
this is a white.
oh, I am just so sorry that i threw the thing out.
i do not know, what can i say?
toby is the instruction card you throw away.
holly, i love you so, so, so much.
looks like a classic seven-man job.
this is not funny.
did not do background checks of the warehouse guys.
i can see the security guard's eyes.
all day long.
he is a sports guy.
i bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.
and most of that was just birds in my condo complex.
must be kind of neat comin' back.
pam.
breathe through your nose.
i know, dwight.
oh, ok. masters of comedy.
i know that i probably messed up your sale.
would you stop it, please?
kev...  nice.
who did you have?
my diabolical plot is on hold for christmas.
oh my  this needs to be shared.
um... for the guests it is.
ya-bome!
okay.
no, that is the problem.
yes.
oh, the wires need insulation.
it was an accident.
no, i did not.
I will do anything, i swear.
okay, well, I will have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
so... ah!
before you got here, I am the one who landed all these clients.
best out of seven.
okay...thief.
oh.
now the goat package obviously has the most goats.
you know.
did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
boom!
then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour.
and they would rather be in the hole.
as you know, we are six days away from phyllis' wedding.
how strange.
ok, what kind of machine is that?
What are you guys talkin' about?
case closed.
erin... what are you doing?
he is my oldest friend, i am going to tell him.
i am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.
mose!
why not do it now?
i am here for my bride!
yes, thank you.
let us give him a minute to settle in, shall we?
what is going on?
hmm?
okay, rolph!
live and let live.
hello, my lady.
what?
ah, ok. what is it?
I am in a very good place right now.
idiot.
actually, i do not care for meredith, but i do not believe in this kind of thing.
dead.
like everybody else.
wha - what is this supposed to be?
break this down.
alright!
i do not like him either.
ahh.
i could beat that on a skateboard.
just checkin'.
I am done talking.
come on.
this is a masculine environment.
why?
god!
thank you.
and you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
wow.
um... no, no, no, no, no.
alright you know what?
yes, about that.
oh.
I am not, I am not getting married.
hey.
pam, really, they are back?
show her.
it would be a great icebreaker.
oh, shhh... come on.
you know what, hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why ryan fired him.
for the performance review.
you did not have to... i do not even know what to say.
they have their own little language now.
yes, exactly.
wait, you want to borrow money?
i want him.
ok.  why did you have to be so damn good?
phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I am the real thing.
everybody it is go time!
we are not supposed to pda.
i know, what you did.
we always invited them.
number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra.
no, we got to be deadly serious.
i am going to call and find out... I am just going to call her.
take my belt, master.
knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
you are an annex kid.
alan's gone.
ahhhhhhhhh.
now we are cooking.
touch the handle.
it is subtle.
i should have done it weeks ago actually.
stanley?
you want her to set you up so you can spike it.
good work.
you know what, pam?
give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself.
i would not let her manage a celery farm.
</p> hey, uh, can i help you out in here?
by me.
it is dehydration.
where did you find him.
kids drive us dads crazy.
not necessarily.
say you are sorry times infinity... ...because there is no comeback for that.
what did you learn in there?
this is going out to indians everywhere.
grab her tongue, grab her tongue!
if we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them?
do i have a choice?
gryffindor!
right over by that fence.
oh no, I am sorry, no king beds.
umm, it is all-inclusive... william randolph shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I am paraphrasing here, "love doth be poison." brilliant.
i am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management.
hold on one second.
okay.
and I am going to stop worrying about calories.
to raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies.
really good.
no, not at all.
oh my god!
huh, angela?
do not pimp me, all right?
i mean you can tell.
okay, pamela.
but i got all the foot off of it.
most of my writing involves the latter.
she was lying.
why do not you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I will tell them.
you are right.
that is exciting.
so, without further ado, kelly you are on.
hello.
you should be thankful that you... i... sum it up darryl, sum it up.
and when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.
do not you?
the menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes.
or, until i start dating, have a girlfriend, then you are, you know, you are gone.
I would come anywhere to see a turtle?
he got a job.
you are so eff-in' smart.
business has been pretty crazy around the office.
then I will grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
michael, that is absurd.
i mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way.
ah, uh, i would love to, but i am really busy.
it was made from a bullet i took out of her left buttock.
I am just too busy.
you were making me do things that were not all right.
you have some savings right?
do you want me to go on amazon and order you a slang dictionary?
daaah, let us just run away together.
da  na na na na.
what are you wearing?
I am trying to get a date with pam's hot friend.
daddy's here for you.
hey, stop it!
no, but we should discuss that another time.
i do not know that i can do that now.
right now, i am in it.
I am going to randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.
they are trying to make me an escape goat.
absolutely!
pardon me.
what is the matter?
you are going to be okay, it is going to... ahh, ooh!
she got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
no, no, no, no, no, no, i insist.
that sounds good!
all right.
ohh, I am thinking... I am going to say... b, tour of dartmouth college.
i love you!
thank you.
okay.
hey, have her come out!
yeah!
last halloween i came as janet jackson's boob.
a quilt.
ah, jim, jim, jim.
it is so not fair that they want me to resign.
i would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... i would be waving that rainbow flag.
yep.
two not-so-great things in a row.
does that make me their doctor?
well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
what?
the male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs.
give me...  give me the diary.
oh!
i thought you were going to parcel those out through the day there is still one thing we could do to get toby fired.
oh c'mon!
yes.
no, what happened with donna?
shhh, pam.
jan, may i introduce to you your own personal dunder mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction.
oh... ah, i almost choked.
i was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
i do not... i know, i know.
do you have anything for that?
the guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.
this is the thing, i am a world class moron.
why on earth would we give you a raise?
okay!
i am michael and i am part english, irish, german and scottish.
you get to look at her.
did i mess up my career today?
welcome, welcome!
ooh hah!
those are the facts.
i got thirsty.
what do we sell?
good.
talkin' bout, uh, what?
I will call you back.
where the hell is that?
I am about to buy this building, you know.
saber.
is she not going to like that?
we already put a call into them, robert.
go all hammurabi on this clown.
it was one joint in the parking lot.
no.
you want to go out?
including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a ouija board... ohhh!
could we get a delorean?
and you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
first got priorities.
I will kill you.
i am so glad that i bought instead of rented.
I will take care of that for you.
four years of malfeasance unreported.
waste?
in a good way.
just put "the hospital." contact number: just put 9-1-1. I am busy.
I am ready to go and I am callin' shotgun.
you know, you are totally harshing the office mellow.
holly like phone?
what are they?
hey!
or, like stormin' norman schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it is over, we will not have to deal with those iraqis anymore.
and i think other people have told me that i have a very symmetrical face.
best western?
because darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority- the client.
well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of dunder mifflin, mr. robert dunder.
cool.
you know what?
dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
oh boy.
you know what?
not counting fdr.
so david wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except nashua, still a little bit raw there.
because you know what they say in the bible about forgiveness?
i bet it is like, "hey, donna, why do not you wash the dishes?" "high-five, donna." "hey, why do not you bring me my slippers?" "hi-five.
never missed a day, my ass.
gosh.
just a possibility.
hey, how did we do?
what else?
alright.
oh, really?
ah, that goof.
i think it was you who did not look closely enough at the gold plan.
right?
come on!
i offered myself to angela and she turned me down.
it can not be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
i am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.
nice.
i will divide and then count to it.
no sitting devices, michael's rules.
you mean like a lair?
that is from superman?
plays the banjo.
no!
i think i am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
he is undercutting us big time.
all right.
no.
okay, i got it.
how?
the world sends people your way... ryan came to me through a temp agency.
and they asked me to be ring bearer.
yes, i am, charles.
that is what makes it fun.
company policy.
yeah.
i do not understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
that is great.
prestige is ours.
you are not a man!
just say it.
the older you get, the bigger the chance is you are going to die.
it is a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
so what, you are having a little spat.
aw, my car.
i can not- watch your step.
ugh.
as a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and i will show you a black man that i trust even more.
oscar?
mmm... nah, that is too young.
besides, the whole thing is a trick question.
deangelo's great.
yes my hero!
mm-hmm.
come along, afterthought.
woo!
we did it, we did it.
ha ha ha!
think with your head, pam.
it is a tankard.
temp!
rrrraah!!!
if i wanted to hit you, i would have hit you.
bye.
could you come in here for a sec?
and i got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.
oh, helene, hi.
tri-managers.
oh, that is them!
i did?
high-fiving?
if it is hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
some people will tell you salesman is a bad word.
alright!
went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive.
no, you do not.
this woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink.
no, no, no, i was here first.
come on.
okay!
shut, it.
i would have never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
i have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now.
carry on.
you know what, I am just being fair.
what is the greatest danger facing dunder mifflin?
all right, this is going to traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
each one better than the last.
but you said you liked it.
um, I will... i have to think about it.
I am just not sure that it is my official resume or if it is something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online.
you want to see what i walked out on?
it is another thing, you bossing me around.
you use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay?
no problem.
pam, no, no.
okay, okay... here is the thing.
it is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat.
"california is bankrupt, and california, california."  what?
satan.
always.
so, strike one, i hate her already.
"this morning, i knocked myself in the head with the phone." "every time i typed my name, it said 'diapers'." "by the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier." the japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard.
i can see why he and jan are no longer together.
you are going to love  them.
i will fix this.
founded, of course by theodore rockefeller.
which is you!
yes!
and that is all i needed; I am good.
if you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
here we go!
david... you are welcome.
anything goes.
you just, do, and i do not know why, so... please help me understand.
it is the easy way out.
shortbread?
no.
fine.
i want you guys to really get crackin on this.
thank you.
ok, let him know that I am here.
could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?
no.
relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
yes.
we can do this.
how many shoes do you need?
or we go against type with an eisenberg or a michael cera.
idiot!
holly does not seem to be engaged, but she is talking to aj like she is.
bye.
yeah.
I am going to start dating her even harder.
jan thinks hunter is very talented.
and i had an offer from ivan schartsky.
are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
i did what i had to do.
mmhmm.
and how about casual friday again, huh?
um... who do you think you are?
body image.
what are you doing?
perhaps.
this is, this is totally on me.

michael, once this gets out... i do not know how it is going to go down.
so what?

the problem, jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition will not receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff.
because... I am awesome!

okay.
ah!
I will have what she is having!

my feelings do not matter to you.
no.
yeah?
if that idiot ever gets here.
what is this?
or do you even know?
yup.
hey, where you would you like to go next?
no, you can stop.

three, two, one, go.
i mean i just do not want to have to tell them something they are not going to want to hear.

mm.
oh, uh oh, I am turning you down right now.
i got thirsty.

jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is jim and pam... and me.

what is wrong?
dwight... no.
and if i thought you had done a better job, i would be saying nicer things right now.
i love stuff.

I am texting about you, okay!?
and on my drives back, i am going to learn spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.
night pam, thanks again for the rum.
however, i rescind my apology.
hey.
ah, all right!

get some white out.
you may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
god.
code red.
I am not blind!
you have to tell him what you did.
i searched everywhere, but i did not find it.

pam can attest, there is no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
i once had a dream.
how is it goin?
i love catching people in the act.
yes, definitely.
so... did not you think 'lazy scranton' was funny?
guys!
it is not over til it is over.
i would like you all to give this a shot.
want to head back?
or me.
you know what, dwight?
what is that?
oh, look at that.
you guys got it soft, and cushy!

she was so innocent.
congratulations karen.

oh, god, i hope it is urine.
i claimed it.
no.
stanley is hilarious.

three squeezes and i would drain you.
everything's going to be fine.
but i was going to.
jim and dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
right.
hmmm... ok, well, it is after five.
now i know what the founders of phillip-morris felt like.
we have company.
yes.
okay, darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture.
you know, this office sort of has a perfect feng shui to it, so... you know, let us not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I am still here- i still have to look at this stuff, guys.
geniuses.
no, sit down.
hey karen.
can i talk to you for a sec?
aw, shucks, tell him I am not here.
i suppose summer had to end sometime.
I would really like some sushi.
what is that?!
i invented a device called 'burger on the go'.
but?
that- i am not known for that!
no.
it hurts my stomach.
i was just talking so just go out there and say anything.
from quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent.
do not worry, it is just a bull tranquilizer.
really?
that is all I am going to say.
no mose!
the f-word.
calling cards are... the wave of the future.
but, like you, i am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
yeah?
i do not know, um, from practical stand point- eat a brog.
oscar, what were you going to say?
doors open in 3...2...1.
my body's literally healing itself.
i want some milk.
so, that is cool.
dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?
respectfully, toby, no.
alright.
"you need to do something about your b.of." ok, i do not know who this suggestion is meant for, but it is more of a personal suggestion and it is not an office suggestion.
I have seen this kid before.
it is going to be good, it is going to be a great bachelor party man.
it did not.
yes, yes i do.
wow, dwight, did you make cuts?
good, what is funny?
give me that.

she later returns dressed in all the "trappings" of extravagant wealth, but instead of going... really?
they have been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
you are not going to be able to talk back.
yeah!
i will even let him die.
that is what I am talking about!
goodbye.
i will take the fall.
let us just say i saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
not on the inside he is not.
yeah, it is illegal, but... everything they do on the shield is illegal.
same thing.
how did you get in your wheelchair?
come here.
dwight!
i have too many things to do before i get dressed.
w-why did you... yes we should.
you saw what i did with pam and jim.
i just p...p...p...p pissed my pants.
lethal weapon?
I have seen her seven times in the last few months, and I am growing very fond of her kids.

yeah, no, it is nobody.
all right, call- ok, no, no, no, no, no, no.
you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps.

i am not on trial here.
dwight, dwight.
the "hottest in the office" award goes to... ...ryan the temp!
well, first of all, i do not have co-workers anymore, i have subordinates.
you look like a clown!
bury it.
i always wondered how they chose the man who was to die.
i agree.
you are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
really?
sometimes you are such a little spaz!
now i need you to lie still for an hour.
what i want to do right now is try something a little different.
that is what she said.
did you hear that, dwight?
mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
yeah, middle school's amazing.
no, I am not saying we do those things.
you might want to watch this angela, because you can not catch anything.
sorry.
happy bird-day.
no!

michael.
it is brilliant, because you would never expect it.
can you breathe?
no!
oh my gosh, now she is up.
but that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
this gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
thank you.
wow.
because of the time i got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
it is show time!
this is going to be good.
well, that is because you and i have very different tastes and you like lame things.
dwight, oh ho, dwight, dwight, my loyal compadre.
oh my gosh, thank you jim, that is so thoughtful.
i can not even look at her without thinking about it ending.
no margarita.
two nights ago, i went to an alicia keys concert at the montage mountain performing arts center.
randall, cfo, resigned.
but first, you got to tell me what your goal is.
okay, okay.
no, i do not want some aspirin, yeah I am a little fussy.
like "gas are not free!" not literally.
is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
they sit in big piles of garbage.
oooh, alright I will talk to her.
hog maw.
what is wrong?
and i had spoken to teresa about a room with two safes?
and it is really not about me, it is about my grandkids, it is about my great grandkids... i can come back here when I am 100, and i can find that piece of cement and say, "that is me.
um... diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I have always said.

it looks like there is going to be downsizing.
did you have a... did you like your lunch?
there is a lot of choices.
nobody likes beets.
nora ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
good luck, michael.
she walks out.
like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he is tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.
garbage magnet.
here we go!
yes.
no spoilers.
shut up.
because i have him investigating her.
non-organic family farmers.
you are barely alive.
used to be a window here.
arrggh.
and a lighthouse.
whose got one, whose got a big idea?
look, i will not pay.
i know you did this, because you are friends with the vending machine guy.
nope.
you do not have to say it like that.
you have got an hour.
now i can observe jim, trap jim, and destroy jim, just like in the bavarian fairy tale.
who opened the morgue for this thing?
oh, wow.
turn it up to elevaan!
I will take that as a no.
you are the bagel guy.
here.
see all these?
so are we set for refreshments?
and none of can say "boo" because none of us have ever been to prison.
"the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-" "-but we will be together then-" "-dad, you know we will have a good time then." ah.
because i want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay?
nurse.
normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I have been through.
andy, andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad.
yeah.
same letter here and here.
that is why there were so many people there.
no, i got it.
who else knows?
yes.
nash.
i call everybody "faggie".
well you guys should hit the road before... i close down another branch.
if you had one word you would use to describe darryl what would that word be?
i just really, really think we should handle this internally.
i would not miss it for the world.
but right at the last minute,  i twist out of the way of the bullet.
shake my hand.
oh, hey, guys.
it feeds my soul.
i watch the l word.
on.
stop doing it.
no.
why are you going to give me this raise?
salesman is king.
all right.
pam, everybody!
okay then we are... yes.
this is tito.
i always call everybody back right away.
ok, alright.
i love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved.
you had your chance.
please, have a seat.
walk with me.
hold up, hold up, hold up!
who to pick?
david?
i am going to be sick... I am going to puke.
and you tried to get off the party planning committee.
i just figured you might have- oh!
this one is with a little twist.
do not let it bother you.
michael!
i will tell on you.
can you get her?
well, I am sorry.
back.
because dwight loves this company.
in my office?
let me feel those.
we are going to turn secret santa into yankee swap.
i think it is a success and I am the one who ended up with dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
at the michael scott paper company in it is heyday.
every year, it is just fun.
i am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.
now all it takes is half a liter.
let us take a look at what he is doing, everybody!
um... ok, "meredith is so old..." everybody?
i do not know what the best plan is, pam.
the streamers?
i made the right decision.
[manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here deangelo.
yes!
should have peed before i left.
fact: you are drinking grape soda.
he is a madman!
you have to close.
you think jim's lying?
that says that you women are up against it.
i do not want to move desks!
jim?
when mary was denied a room at the inn... jesus was born.
i think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
calm, please have you ever seen a burn victim?
i will be tea baggin' it.
ok, i will see you very soon, alright?
hmm.
no one's even going to notice.
well, it is a pretty big check.
i am flipping out, man.
thank you.
here we go.
no.
as his right-hand man, it is my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
it is too small.
the big round things.
oh!
dwight, come on... there is no downsizing.
because while i was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
shaved off my goatee.
thank you.
the triumph of the will.
what is this?
just, shh, everybody.
you talkin' to me?
okay.
oh, oh, oh!
something happened!
no, the baby does not ruin anything, kevin, ok?
oh, look at that.
this brings back memories.
the job was not mine to give.
having to hug and kiss and spoon, i make them feel beautiful.
ladies and gentlemen, may i present to you for the first time as a couple, mr. and mrs. bob vance!
so we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 dundie awards.
hank, could you come up here please?
i would kill with the brother stuff.
tit for tit.
how is the party coming along?
instead, i will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
god, man!
cool!
why would we do that?
here we go!
i can not see because i am in a-  gah!
your the only one i trust." no thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble.
this last dundie is for kevin, this is the "do not go in there after me" award.
excuse me.
aaaaaaaa!
i can think like michael.
why did you have to go off  and die?
please?
scranton!
what are you writing?
save yourself!
i work with michael.
hmm.
your client, dunmore high-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.
she could be a gay woman.
merry christmas!
um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost.
that is the way it is around here.
yeah, he looks like a schrute, but he thinks like a halpert and he acts like a beesly.
what?
just get me out of here.
same answer.
they flare like that every time you are engaging in deception.
the new boss does not find jim adorable!
get a room santas!
everybody, let us just get over the whole meredith thing.
what is our excuse?
what happened here?
there are very few things that would make me not want to team up with david wallace.
hello.
no, no, no!
come on, stanley let us go.
but it is already three of the clock!
but he could not.
gabe, just go and have fun with erin.
on the street we did not have any rules.
you know what, I will pay for it.
i did not do it.
oh d--!
that is not going to happen.
hello.
i want you to rub butter on my foot.
ha ha.
enough of your magical riddles!
although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
yeah.
that is just what i call him, so... i am by far the most qualified person they are interviewing.
but the brain is so effing hot.
michael?
they hand these out to little kids.
...alright, so, raise your hand if you want to get rich.
the world shines on mose.
you are not stupid.
that makes me kind of uncomfortable.
i taught jim and dwight everything i know about sales.
'wow!
remember?
what do you know about meredith?
who?
it actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.
I am your friend.
so in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts.
that is what she said.
how you doing?
turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell.
and i will travel to new zealand.
because a lot of people think that models, even though they are very attractive, are somewhat vapid.
you cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.
come on in.
from dwight.
look, we will tell her that it is bad, but it could have been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work i was able to cut it in half.
it was his birthday, just turned three.
just a little announcement folks, remember, the dundies is a black tie affair.
are you getting this?
i did not say anything when phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony.
it is just ice, it will melt all over the floor.
very cool.
whoa, oscar!
oh that is real creative.
she needs a woman's touch.
it is... it is one of those two.
they can not see my face.
did she say what it is about?
because if you did i would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations.
can i speak to you a minute?
fat halpert.
uh, hi.
thank you.
i feel like neve campbell in sream ii.
oh god.
get off the phone!
because this is way, way too good.
no need to thank me.
i mean what waste!
this is going to turn your life around, ryan.
so just hang in there.
a lightbulb.
so... no.
just act normal.
wait, when did we start talking about the mob?
tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by.
that was offensive and lame.
but it is not christmas, it is diwali.
ryan.
who am i?
come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
this is a starbucks digital barista.
they will be assisting you today.
yeah?
he is kind of a weirdo.
haha, i do!
fair enough.
clarice?
pam, in the frozen food section, swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
well i do not know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
yeah!
he has the award-ah!
no.
and I am thinking that uh, next time you are in the shower, you should check yourself out.
this is great, thank you!
ahh.
what is your problem?!
ooh!
let me give you the tour.
blind guy.
oh... that is going to change.
okay, everybody out.
it would... be fine.
we do not have to call him that.
mose does not know how to use a phone.
are you sure you are doing that right?
do not get into that now.
oh, after you.
just going to walk over here-  whoa, whoa, I am slipping and falling!
i can not wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife.
possibly.
andy?
be there!
if they catch us, they will rape us.
it should not go all night long, so if you would like me to, i could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence.
okay, I am calling the police.
hey pam.
we could totally break the pig rib!
let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
yep, not as good as gold.
that is... that is.
oh!
i was trying to go- ok, ok. then you know what?
ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
no, never heard of it.
oh shoot.
i do not want to do this.
let us get to it, shall we?
so long, stanley!
i still have the lease on the michael scott paper company, so occasionally i will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing.
enough with the sass, please.
stanley!
okay, I am not hindu, but... carol.
um... we have to watch, uh, toby's video that he is showing us in order to brainwash us and i was wondering if anybody would like to join in?
this way, this way, this way?
i feel like it but i am not going to.
i do not know how those got on there... must be hackers.
practically lives there.
argh... gah!
you yelled at me.
i know, i know you have a phone policy.
what?
someone get me a banana.
e-mail from stanley.
i do not think there is a whole lot of sleeping going on.
it is done.
this cannot stand.
just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
no, pam.
to the michael scott paper company!
I am just a bee, dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'.
i love justice.
you are great.
jell-of!
well, he may not be here.
ok behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and i have chosen one of the best.
who else could do this?
ah.
do you like magic?
because she did not like one message i left on her voicemail?
to dwight.
maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
nametag?
no, you have been towed by now.
then it is no longer a mistake... gabe.
ryan, you want to stretch?
okay, so dig this: you are on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
that is a piece of cake.
um.
okay.
that is our most popular room.
i have vengeance to exact.
why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?
what is that?
what do i write?
like a cow thing.
welcome all!
that was terrible advice.
both.
i am very happy right now.
it is going to be okay.
yeah, so i do not have to worry?
seven.
the ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger.
here she is!
come on!
i will grab you here anyway.
i knew it.
i did not think it was per mile kind of deal.
meredith, we are doing this for your own good.
that is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
um... no, we are not married... yet!
...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, nasa blanket, and, in case i get bored, harry potter and sorcerer's stone.
I am not, jim.
oh yes, i will.
did you know that gay used to mean happy?
wow.
you will now wrestle my cousin mose.
I would love to be in the loop, david.
all in favor of purebred.
yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I will read it over.
it is been a rough couple of weeks.
assistant regional manager.
only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars.
i am a sith lord.
false!
the problem is the chicks.
if the salad is on top, i send it back.
that.
it is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
well, look around.
she is knocked up.
yeah, well, I am not paying for my own stuff, okay?
ok, just remember to keep breathing.
let us go!
i know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with hr.
it is a colloquial way of saying "you are fired," kevin, which you are.
i have come here today to talk to mr. david wallace about this whole thing going on with sabre.
i do not understand.
ok. oh, god.
that was the news.
well, it is mostly made up.
how it is made?
i, i surely do, and do not call me honey.
i can not stop this investigation.
oh, okay.
how do we combat this guy?
so you heard schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
aaah... thanks, dwight, for a crappy plan.
i think you need to say good bye.
and, let me tell you something it was delicious.
i told dwight that there is honor in losing.
whether it is not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team does not exist.
to protect me.
come on.
he is my nephew.
you have been so wonderful!
no, you did not see me in there with her.
so here is oscar.
oh yeah, they do not allow kids at sandals.
i know when their birthdays are, i know what their favorite kind of cake is, i know what color streamers they like... yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
forties.
and it was not even his birthday, but i heard about it the next day in school.
i brought silly string, dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
hey there.
better get used to it.
mwah!
no, it is... involves the photograph.
i sent it in.
hello.
i would love to take them all to jamaica, but is that good management?
the activities commence in four seconds!
yeah, well when i call about big problems you do not like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo.
me.
these are shaped like paper.
and this is before i had even heard of one, or seen one.
beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.
yeah.
nice try jim.
it would be better if you were unconscious.
oh?
it is all kind of weird.
phyllis vance, ladies and gentlemen!
in japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.
who is the king of austria?
it is not sweetie, it is michael scott.
why do not you use them?
ya know.
what is your pin number?
green m&amp;ms!
really sad.
okay.
america, i do not think you need to worry.
ok, alright.
he looks just like me.
yes.
also, it is not your real family.
um, sure, i will get you the best iced tea in the world.
look at that.
whoa!
you are that friend.
please.
that is correct.
i was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
do you think they should have had open auditions for the band hanson?
and i, yours.
how are you?
aaaaaaaa!
hey.
he was in the backseat.
you are welcome.
sure.
great.
get away from him.
what?
not my style.
I am going around to all the branches, and I am telling them my secret recipe for success.
next year?
so we are starting with account setup- okay, can i have that?
yes.
you are not leaving.
boom, like this.
you are?
so get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.
oh, wow!
i call shuffle.
except, instead of a boy, I am a man.
today helped.
transfer!
this is my conference room.
move in here.
dwight's a jerk!
hannah?
and that is that we are... a group of people... who work together.
so chill.
jim.
okay.
you solve a case, and yes, I have solved plenty.
make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
yeah i was tripling up.
scooch.
yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots.
if you are so anxious to see a head roll, it is you.
you are welcome.
these s'mores are disgusting.
two points, three points, four points.
i will call david and give him the customer list and i will give him all my info.
hey pam.
no, please do not do this, monkey.
yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market?
creed.
let us go.
it is fear.
but first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch.
mm-hmm.
cosby.
finally I will have someone at my desk clump who gets me.
but, you know, this place is kind of tapped out, so.
okay.
hey!
it was insensitive and i am sorry.
you suck!
you guys excited about the party?
about what?
all right, here we go!
line it up phyllis.
make a decision.
very much, jim is my best friend.
anybody else?
I am positive.
thank you very much.
well, hello to you, too.
step lively!
blue jeans, the grand canyon.
five times for $30,000?
and our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...kevin.
erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
no.
i think it is because of my low cheekbones.
andy is like marv something.
make a sandwich.
all right.
rule 17: do not turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season.
bush league!
you never met him.
come on, stanley!
how would you even know?
oh!
haha.
do the monkey face.
good.
here ya go.
you are incorrect.
and you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.
night erin.
let us go.
no, i am the team manager.
mmhm.
that is not big picture.
you are all members of the yakuza and you happen to be visiting the lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?
and now packer wants to come home.
here we go.
charles really did a number on these guys.
he sucked.
well, you know what?
cancel card.
let us meet some of the folks that make the scranton branch so special.
i need it.
no, pam.
what did they do to you, angela?
we do not do that.
there would be no government, and things could get terrible.
oh, you know.
i am your hay king!
i can not believe I am going to say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost.
ok, well, i did not say to write your name down, did i?
there is no time to think about if this is real.
I am creative, ryan.
phyllis?
oh but i can push drugs in here?
i want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... take a card, take a card, any card.
you want to go down?
you know what we need?
time to bring out the big guns.
okay, everybody, shh!
do not do the squirrel.
do not-all right.
but you can say that about anything.
okay.
but what do i know, i mean, that is just according to the pentagon.
do you want to be a part of this?
ok?
I am telling you... if you do not do this,  i do not stand a chance.
so... yep.
okay, we are done.
that was gross.
who is ready to work?
yeah we weigh about the same, would not you say?
that way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
but it is an even bigger day for me.
hi!
my boo, holly.
i can not do this.
jan says anything that does not scare us is not worth doing.
alright.
he wears glasses.
ahh, legs are sorta giving out.
because we are no longer lovers, and she is just hurting.
secrets of a call... more secrets of a call girl.
nobody knows why.
if you are ryan's parents or pam's parents or my parents, you do.
the shield.
assistant to the regional manager dwight.
i hate it!
and we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it.
wait a minute!
hello david.
actually, kevin, you might like it!
yeah.
hold tight.
if you were getting fired, how would you want to be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
sorry i was a jerk.
phhhbt.
just... try not to be such an idiot.
ok. put them on speaker.
fine.
yes.
including prep time?
get back... back to work!
plus, there is some other good news.
remember on lost when they met the others?
it is a letter of recommendation.
is that jim's?
it is like don rickles on acid, man.
she is really nice.
maybe because she is my girlfriend.
hey, you know, i do not know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya do not, we could hang out.
i do.
that is your advice?
question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
ok. you know, our sales are fine.
ok. hold on, hold on.
man what a day huh?
or should i say, corpse space.
when michael clump wants to remind you  that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.
ryan, it is michael and dwight.
god.
there we go!
all of them.
hey, dwight.
and if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop.
the thing is, angela... you are in here an awful lot.
ah, no.
oh, please.
that is it, that is it, perfect.
oh, well, thank you jim.
huh, okay.
just keep pushing... I am right here.
alright let us go!

here is the story, champ.
look at his face!
no, it is alright.
good.
have you seen gabe?
come on!
what is the deal with grapenuts?
this is very boring stuff.
must be... okay, okay.
there is a big, big future in that.
gather round.
dwight, you ignorant slut.
messages?
these are not criminals.
case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, i do not wannna get my head stepped on.
do you know a joke?
pitiful.
because, i will.
if it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
so costa rica that was - did you have fun?
hi.
oh that is mine actually.
my mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden.
you know what?
i do not even know, I am a baby!
there is coffee in the kitchen, pam.
like that, uh, dwarf from lord of the rings.
every morning he would wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy.
walk with me.
well, you know... maybe you should go to business school like ryan, then... then you would know what you are talking about.
no, i do not have computer games on my work computer.
come on.
really?
I am tired of being mr. perfect role model all the time.
it is my greatest dream come true.
most of the time i will be with ryan, or darryl.
attention!
no.
hi, linda.
um... other starters... me, of course.
also i would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our... trouble.
you are not ready.
no!
who else?
i hope that you are willing to die in this office, because i am... hey toby, could i talk to you for a minute?
the nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen.
please just check.
and such a genetically improbable one.
relationships, we do not need no stinking relationships.
you learn a lesson, and then you find a lead.
did i feel bad for killing him?
what i propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and i need your help.
oooh.
i was there... and I will tell you what.
when ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in hazelton just so the other girl would not see.
whom, whom... whom?
this is way too important.
they will probably watch it right away.
this is so stupid.
nooo!
hello, pam.
oh, and tell me, um, how is your gay son?
michael, i do not think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
do not you work here full-time?
well, who needs him.
buckle up.
wait, do we have until the end of the day?
oh.
today, i, michael scott, am becoming a homeowner.
this cannot stand.
we are not done.
you know, some, ah, pigtails?
new record.
get ryan.
twice as fast as you would normally go.
okay, security guard.
you embarrassed me.
oh, yeah!
ok, give me the ball.
yeah.
stop crying.
five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.
do not you ever talk to me that way.
except this.
no, i think something bad, maybe.
i do not think that i can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.
what the?
there he is!
... and... we had sex, too.
if you guys stay, i will stop watering down the soap.
i... i can not give you that, i-- i do not make this much.
you are welcome.
right?
ok, fine.
phyllis, i do not have acne.
fear is what it is all about.
yeah!
thank you!
yeah!
i got an offer that you can not refuse.
and i believe in your ability to make the right choices.
you know, i had a great crop yield this fall... i went to the store and i pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away.
no.
i can hear it in your voice.
oh, you know what.
maybe the michael scott paper company was a huge mistake.
it is a trash can.
yes.
jimbo, let us do this thang.
you are acting like a dork.
i do not remember in which direction.
there is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea.
not again.
good morning, vietnam!
abraham lincoln once said that, "if you are a racist, i will attack you with the north." and those are the principles... damn it.
college roadshow.
go away.
no.
all right.
just a minute.
you are right.
you can all have jobs at schrute farms as human scarecrows.
I am out of here.
you can not do that.
what are you doing?

on our own.
anybody have any ideas of what we could do.
okay.
dwight, jim is sitting next to me.
i am not.

here is something.
i do not expect everybody to understand.
yes.
160. uh, just a few more items.
that was good!
i need him gone.
how do you mean?
may i?
go ahead.
and people will never go out of business.
oscar martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son.
take your bad vibes with you.

i want people to be afraid of how much they love me.
well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal- well, i... it could be either of us.
who is that sportscaster that bit that lady?
so... who do you think it should be?
and it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that is the mystery.
the boys' department.
no, you do not.
yeah!
be careful.
it is going to make some really good toilet paper.
nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
you are a bad person." it is very dramatic.
it is.
it is like, "really, jim?
you got to do something- how much time do you think you will need?
so where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
same old party, same old people.
close your eyes.
thank you, michael.
yeah!
dwight!
oh god...i better call.
exactly.

well, maybe they will not get slashed if you answer all my questions.
yes, pam.
whenever I am getting married, you do not believe me.
rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
or, should i say, the banquet hall.

I am going to save you!
that is what I am talking about!
I am just going to leave right now.
yes, they do, jim.
yeah, no.
no other animal on earth could do this.

so, uh, corporate just said that i do not want to... oh, thank you.
really good.
bring it on.
i have to put you on with my boss.
i will not donate my winnings to comic relief, since apparently it does not exist.

i will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something.
alright, how about the phyllis/angela dispute?
come here.
we have the dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it is sexy, it is sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?
is this downsizing?
yes, i do.
as a matter of fact, I am going to give you some seed money.
phyllis?
you know i used to think that i had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that is just silly because she is dead.
giggle-giggle, juji-juji, i get it, i get it.
is she hot?
hello, january talk to you later, january salad.
I will help.
back to the future?
it is a big day for phyllis.

no office romances.
ok.. just get off.
i feel good.
let us get down to business.
okay, here is what we do.
it is festive.
unless things go well with ryan today in which case, i will not hang out with mose so much anymore.

boom.
I am sick of it jim.
i did not see it at home, i did not see it in the bathroom, i did not see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light... the big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?

you know what, pam?
i would do the same for you.

hey, um... get out of my way.
I have got you!
I am going to kill myself.
somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
thank you angela.

any specific animal?
c'mere, c'mere, c'mon!
not directly, but through the money.
coming through.
try not to draw attention, please.
come on!
that is not going to happen.
okay, alright.
i basically decorated my condo for free with all of my swag.

i already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
jim!
no.
well, pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
sorry, michael, i got calls to make.
just fudge the numbers." not bad, pretty funny, i do not appreciate condoning corporate fraud though.
michael!?
come on.

okay, hey, hey, hey... did not think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, jim?
ah, how did that happen?
hold still, woman!
seriously.
they are on a date.
i would like to introduce you to mr. danny cordray.
ryan is being a little bitch again.
you never talk to jim.
except dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
no more knock-knock jokes.
anyone else?
got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
that is not a toast.
okay.
okay, i believe you, i believe you.
you are the best gd girlfriend in the world.
my head just exploded.
roy.
what are...?
as dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
i would like to see someone else pull this off.
yes!
well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect.
you will.
you know what?
just tell me what happened.
a fake brother who steals your jeans.
are you kidding me?
well actually i can not cook, and i am starting a restaurant.
i sa- sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet!
it helps our because.
de-nied!
because you can not always tell, so... how would i know.
nice to meet you.
i do not, i do not know.
what does this look like, a shower store?
no.
easier to stop if it turns on us.
yeah.
shut up.
and when i came to, i had an epiphery.
holly is right.
command central.
well, you know what?
he has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range.
hm mm mm mm.
phillip will be joining us in the office today.
you are making it sound kind of lame.
somebody, who i think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out.
hey, what do you say, when i get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun?
yes!
no!
shhh.
that is right.
martha stewart!
a little bit.
we will be stuck between floors for hours.
oh!
this is shaping up to be an awesome day for dwight.
first i was afraid, i was petrified.
i inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard.
so I will just think of something else to say.
just... just focus on the facts.
"i have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit." guten tag, herr michael.
i still try to be a friend first, but... you know?
"hey pam, let us buy expensive bathrobes and hug." i think we will be fine.
well, i am just glad this is all over.
he was not happy at all when i offered him this job and then i told him he did not get the job, so- i do not appreciate you telling me what to do.
it is perfect, thank you.
all right.
more than a friend, a co-worker.
rolf is my best friend, and he is the man.
the swat's arriving.
oh, it will work.
i would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
sorry, sorry, sorry.
try 80. hey, hey, how is your interview going?
okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.
you gave all the love that i needed... pum pum pum pum pum pum pum bye pam.
so you discovered the break room.
we have ryan, the new guy, right?
yeah, i know when it is from, ryan.
no.
good.
shh, please!
no.
come on olympics of suffering right here.
i am a practitioner of goju ru karate, here in scranton.

mallard.
okay.
and i really do not have time to learn new words right now, ok?
thirty!
ring it!
and i want charles gone.
good work.
when you use something to block- i think everybody knows what i am talking about.
great sportscaster.
jesus sort of ruined the party.
no, michael, stop it!
uh huh.
the company's doing fine.
do i go for the vault?
let us run aunt shirley's farm.
um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we will be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.
guilty as charged!
it is johnny carson, karnak.
i kind of arranged it.
everybody loves beets.
what do you think?
</i> we filmed this during an actual scranton high school hockey game, trying to qualify for states.
hey.
and good for them.
oh.
umm, hmmm.
I am not kidding.
look, I am all about loyalty.
you want a real horse?
get  them there.
some cocoa?
i was shocked when i found out.
i, jim halpert... ...confess to health care fraud.
you know how these things go.
no, panic is warranted!
I am not saying that is what he said.
if you do not knock it off... ...I am never going to tell you anything ever again.
alright, since i am the boss i will drive as well.
what old days?
here is what is going to happen.
morning.
hey, pam.
jo invites michael to house.
oh wow!
separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key... alright.
is there something that you would like to say to me?
...it is a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies.
350 and one penny.
you should not believe everything you hear.
and i just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive.
oh, yeah.
yes!
that is not in the contract.
there is no way in hell that i am going to say that we are broke.
is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings?
dwight, are those your pants?
no!
i could have stopped him.
ok with my leads and stuff like that?
kun-kun!
oh this is so important, i should run to answer it.
is that what you are wearing?
no, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend.
you know, whatever.
a medium amount of good pizza?
every night, a different woman.
he does not need help, pam.
yum yum yum!
okay.
ryan.
well, what should i do, guys?
huh?
pam, hello.
keep it down.
angela from accounting told me what you did.
it is pony.
hike!
okay.
keep the wing flaps.
hey, okay.
well.
I am sick of the cocky walk, i am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, i am sick of your uppity attitude, jim... i think i am not going to give these to you.
also, i did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
this happens, you have a lot to learn my friend.
oh yeah?
ready?
she was so young and now she is dead.
blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle... ...in a bitter battle..hey, hey!
kidding.
I am just going to have to run right through you.
do you use it?
where have you been?
it is extraordinary.
uh, stanley is having a stroke.
what did you just call him?
today, at the end of the day, i will have, for all of you, a big surprise.
i can become you like that.
if you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so... come on in.
it is european and... yes?
stop!
um... yeah, well, if you leave we will only have two left.
you listen to me.
let us do a little something.
andrew, what about you?
ok. oh, there we go.
the electric city.
okay?
oh yes i will!
it is super duper."  i do not know, something like that.
here we go.
hey, hey... he is not sitting with me either.
I will talk to you tomorrow.
come... come on!
i just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when i make a sale.
i- mmm- I am good.
here is the thing.
i brought in some new faces, and one old.
oh no.
bring it all the way around, there is going to be a good amount of blood.
christmas card list.
can i just do one thing while you are making this announcement and then I will never, ever do it again?
beautiful.
speak.
so we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
yeah, let us just cancel this, okay?
ugh...  I am in.</i> oh yeah!
okay, it does not say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it is policy, it should say it on the coupon.
it goes to show that everything you want in life, you get.
i... damn it jim!
that is a very firm handshake.
no.
i can not believe you are here.
and i may come down and fire you if you do not do your job."  but what were talking about when we first kissed?
well, i guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and pam and ryan.
and you know what?
no, of course  you can not go.
the bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
when i saw him, i would never be able to apologize to him.
uh, yeah.
i do not think you would like it up there.
there it is!
you deserve it.
i will say b, buffalo!
no, no, no, no, no!
duh.
it is part of my green initiative.
and you are disgusting, dwigt.
i got nothing cooking, it is cooked.
this is all platonically, of course.
the coach!
well it is weevil season but we were prepared.
my old boss ed truck has died.
huh.
I am the one who suggested that you fire him.
we are thinking.
as you know, there is going to be downsizing.
you might be surprised to learn that I have only been to one other wedding.
yeah, jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort.
i catch the ball.
schrute sperm are strong,  but they are no match for a grown schrute man.
well, it goes, it goes in the best direction, and that was not the best direction.
yeah?
angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she is in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.
you got me!
on three.
right.
is that you?
kelly?
van helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
and i feel like you want more than this little office has to offer.
it is not a popularity contest.
so, earlier today, stanley sassed me, and toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him.
oh... ok. okay, well... all settled, then.
be that as it may, i have your meatball parm sandwich here, and i am going to eat it.
oh... remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... look at that perm, that perm is so boss.
they did not.
no.
was there any emotion going on?
that mall is corrupt, ok!
i am chandler and joey and, uh, pam is rachel.
right.
goodbye prince family,  should be called the sucker family.
what time we got?
I will let you know.
never!
king of the stupid universe?
one of these buttons is -- damn it.
so I am... okay, well, we will figure something.
showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates.
your body only has a certain amount.
no, i mean this apartment building, it is fantastic.
hello.
ladies and gentlemen, may i present, robert california!
toby, come on.
a horse.
we will come back at... how is  4:45?
and you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home.
what is jim capable of... or pam... or kevin?
I have never lost a fight.
let us see josh find another stanley.
with phyllises and kevins sprouting up all over the place.
well, I am just going to ask.
I am going to start my own paper company.
well, okay... what is that smell?
it is like christmas, easter, and halloween-- --rolled into one.
yes, i am.
that would be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
woohoo!
okay, cool.
we are very excited about the merger with sabre.
there are several penises there I would love phyllis to run her eyes over.
and... go.
it should just come about effortlessly.
have you seen the baler?
when people work together, there is going to be conflict.
and like donna.
are you talking to me?
also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
that could be you  if you had not forgotten french.
that was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... it was supposed to be with bills and it does not work great with faxes.
i could tell, from the body language.
can you say cut?
I am fine.
and it was either living with myself or... being happy.
huh?!
i hope he does not haul off and just hit you.
very good!
i- a watch would be nice.
and i was great.
i do not know how.
which is why i have modeled all my games after survivor.
yes, getting hooked on mega-desk was my own damn fault.
he poisoned me.

I am sorry.
dwight, do not!
let us do it!
but... you also have to win to play.
it is not your business, dwight.

what do you think, phyllis?
it is not offensive during a roast!
ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
this may be phyllis' only wedding ever.
well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
mi- sorry.
no, no.
that is where you come in.
this is a message to the entire office so they can see that i am capable of physically dominating them.
i saw it in a movie.
could be a knife, could be a gun.
my point is... that as long as people like you and me do not stop talking, nobody can stop the usa.
do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
first present, oscar.
and he is also clever.
and i will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you could not believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
up to no good?
it will last longer.
okay, let us do this thing!
really nice job.
you rich people.
no!
wow.
come here.
oh, four and a half hours?
here.
um, pam, i hate to break this to you but dwight can not stop you from being mugged.
i think I am growing into a giant.
i do not know, that is why you are here, help me.
hey.
i do not want to die!
everything is wrong, dwight.
what is up?
forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
it makes me look like i hire babies.
okay.
and do not say the bathroom, because i kicked in all the stalls.
from me.
we cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident.
okay, well, this will not do.
oh, wow!
been thinking about you.
i think it is going to be any minute now.
better luck next year.
here we go.
i... do not see you.
yeah, that sounds good.
oooookay.

what is taking so long?
she is not here, but she gets it.
mmm.
alright.
pass.
i understand.
hey!
oh...never mind.
what is so wrong about me?
try 'control p'.
it is more of a david-and-goliath thing.
good, good, good.
my lips are sealed.
you have to enjoy it.
think i did a good job?
and my house is my house.
where is michael?
also I am going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
and the same thing goes for quarterly reports.
yeah?
watch this.
we did it!
tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
ha ha ha!
well... we have nothin to talk about, dwight.
not important.
buena vista oscar.

so... what is that?
look at this one.
i mean, he knows exactly how you are feeling.
i know, i know, i know.
does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?

oh, you know what that is!
well, he <i>is</i>.
hey... why did you do it?
mmmmmm.
you are good, they know it.
darryl.
does not hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
andy!
do you know that?
this is your family.
they told me i need to let somebody go.
there is no turtle, michael.
i might want lunch.
and i know what glee is, I am a total gleek.

and facial symmetry- come on.
I will tell you.
he went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.

well, first of all, you need a building.
hey, thank you, creed.

I am going in for a procedure today.
he is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman.

well done.
is that what we are going for now?
kelly the whole time.
because i will.
great work tonight.
do good.
because... thank you, michael.
that is right.
i need you.
you said it was at a four-way stop... and the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that is always trying to teach people things.
this might get ugly.
it hurts my arms.
and we have begun.
well, i do not have a lot of choices.
let us go!
is that true?
what are you reading?
oh, my god.

you are ruining the mood.
watch this part, okay?
i have some important business matters to take care of.
the whole thing's silly, is not it?
we could fire meredith.
the day he is born.
we need more attitude like that around the office.
jim?
oh, this guy in my neighborhood, tom dizemore.
i talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff.
fire him!
those things are tiny.
shall i?
oh, party in the break room!
yes!

my name is michael scott, i work at dunder mifflin.
i guess she is technically the senpai.
wait.
this place is so cursed.
ok you are useless.
that means conference room, five minutes!
you are still stuck in traffic.
when bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate.
we are livid.
which is half the people there.
wow!
thank you... dwight.
you are creative.
sorry.
it is ugly.
we are like 'friends'.
there are clouds in the sky, which means going to rain, bad for business.
this goes to stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.
because it is in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the ceo and chairman, david wallace!
wait, wait- listen guys, one more point and we play corporate.
what is happening?
everyone inside the car was fine, stanley!
nope, come on.
he has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
bah!
i know, i know.

long day.
what do you think?
aww, times are tough, pam.
you know what?
I am hearing you, meeting confirmed.
oh, that is funny.
well, we do not- whatever, yeah.
and the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother.
you are fake salivating over a soviet era russian.
sorry you had to hear that.
to recoup their losses, i am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over scranton can come and bid on our goods and services.
okay.
we will see.
well, you have... ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have... ...and i am very proud of being a narc.
the bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.
we are going to have fun.
okay, I am going to have to supplement that.
i can also make it the sky.
you know what?
wow.
no, did you?
dwight.
scram.
all right, all right, secret sign.
i am glad that today spurred social change.
what we have to do here is go to run, and then you look up to powerpoint.
the puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch.
come on, stanley!
bummer.
that is, you know what?
thank you very, very, very..." when i was in the sixth grade, i was a finalist in our school spelling bee.
come on you bastard!
the world's tiniest bluetooth?
I will ask you a question.
it was me against raj patel.
let us be honest.
no respect at all.
good.
no, i have to take it, or it will seem suspicious.
some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
jim will turn to the drink.
one mississ... ok, you went that far on one mississ.
listen, i can not make you laugh right now.
and i hate it.
i should not say that jokingly because she will sue me.
hey.
yeah.
ryan, can you come here a second?
let us go.
that guy?
big plans.
so we can do this again.
what about my wish that we do not have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
i want it to be better than 'great', pam.
I will give you five bucks for it.
yes.
have to think it through.
brr brr brr brr  and i, dwight schrute, am in charge of the entire operation.
you should have seen your face.
jim.
are you kidding me?
that is what she... kind of in the middle of something here.
oh do you?
how late do we have to work tonight?
grr!
yes he is.
one more.
and eight tries added up.
okay, fine.
I am definitely going to do it.
jim, good party, huh?
i know.
oh thank god.
kevin!
let us go!
pam, run a comb through your hair.
god, what are we going to do!?
i have some very great news from corporate.
ohhh, man!
no, i will not even consider it.
hey!
alright.
because it is a big universe, and we are all just little, tiny specks of dust.
john wayne gacy.
am i right?
what?
I am pretty good on politics.
goodbye.
like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less.
I will do a shot, michael.
he is not going to be a murderer.
why us?
uhh.
yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.
he says stanley uses his miracle whip without asking.
uh huh.
to what do i owe this pleasure?
no.
yes, everybody, come on.
ok hey.
and i always will.
i know.
how much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
when i was little my dad and i played a lot of games together.
we are in a stairwell.
you must not touch the ground.
shhh... just calm down.
and today, both darryl and i took something.
mighty forest.
five yards in and your forearms will be on fire.
you will never kill it that way.
hey goldenface.
when all this is over, I would like to actually go to one of trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.
and i hate pleasure.
why do not you go home, and come back for the party?
come on.
creed, you are teeth called, your breath stinks.
ha.
let us go.
um... oh, where is that?
it is a ream of paper.
good attitude, hottest in the office.
there he is, the birthday boy!
yeah.
what was the most inspiring thing I have ever said to you?
cheer or fear?
how can we pay for an office?
we have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket.
yes, good.
kids in high school still call me 'ponytail'.
some companies still know how business is done."  okay?
tell me dana, how is your chicken breast?
why do not you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what is your cell?
it was awesome.
let me give you a hand.
but also upper middle management.
dwight, wow.
look.
are you near sighted or far sighted?
but if you stay, i want an apology,  and i want a big one.
so i, you know, an employee will go home, and he will tell his neighbor, "hey, did you get an award?" and the neighbor will say, "no man.
yeah.
we are going to be doing some darts, we are going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.
all right, everybody, take a seat.
of course, if you beat us, you are fired.
hey, well, we have time!
oh my god.
wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
look at me!
oscar, why do not you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.
you know what?
it is showtime!
hey!
okay, okay, I will just learn about china and science and geography and math and literary.
"a real man makes his own luck." billy zane.
yeah.
what did erin want again?
what is next?
come up with a joke that i can use, okay?
when a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.
do not lie about your shoulders!
what is wrong with this thing?
oh, my god.
i feel you.
that is actually not a good example, because i have been compared to a young paul newman, my eyes and my face.
and you have made my life so much easier in that i am going to have to let you go first.
what, what is this?
I have got his back.
i walked right into that.
have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day.
that is like... a half an hour, every hour?
women were considered the best gender.
"old school".
doobie-doobie doo.
my own bestich mensch.
what?
well, that is how we do it in scranton.
you know what, I am going to raise the stakes.
i know.
well, he does not do very well under pressure.
are we smart?
because I have got this idea... alright.
pam, i have ideas on a daily basis.
stanley, you may go.
good luck.
no, I am not busy.
it is cheaper.
he is beautiful.
i love this.
actually, let us go into the conference room.
wow, the honor.
actually looks bigger with people in it.
but grotti acts like he is mafia though.
let your breasts explode.
you know what, you will be fine.
that is what being a man is.
um... i always imagined it with a giant check.
i was talking about... what do- what?
stupid.
okay, well, you did not tell me that.
hey ryan.
it is complicated.
that is it?
i hope that can be enough for you.
you are going to hate it.
give me something hard to sell.
no, i only answer to detective wallace because i got a warm body in the other room.
do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
and he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita.
yeah, it does, actually.
question.
I will make you two tapes.
excuse me, everyone.
i said if corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they are going to have to go through me.
yeah, definitely.
no, rose.
here we go.
how are you holding up?
up and over.
that is dwight.
we are not here.
it is all for me.
okay, good suggestions.
no!
ugh!
i can not do the presentation, i can not-  ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, god!
and just want to state for the record that i am intending to sue jim for acute psychological distress.
the last supper.
get the cake.
if they stay in there too long they are going to get on the same cycle.
you are the silent killer.
although i do look forward to our professional relationship.
who is that guy?
because nobody here is willing to help me.
okay, and... okay.
so see you later.
so, when, um, can i see you again?
hmm.. would you excuse me for a second?
it will be awesome.
my new sensei, sensei billy, thought i had more than enough training to take the test.
it is $475!
slow and steady.
what is his name?
i love music.
yeah.
yeah.
give me the phone.
you were bought out.
i mean, they are just dough twisted up with some candy.
she washes dogs.
we found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when stanley had his... when his heart went berserk.
i will go to my room.
oh, good.
here we go.
uh, i need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
you do not need to help me here.
last time i checked that is called sales.
here we go.
yes.
i dare you.
oh no, i have a thing tonight.
you, you like that?
now, hold your bowls forward.
yes, howard gruber, please.
what do you think history is?
move it!
did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
in my second life i was also a paper salesman and i was also named dwight.
you do not have one single girlfriend?
you are safe here.
but you know what?
here.
this does not seem like a very big operation.
stripper?
mr. grotti we meet again.
roasted.
and andy, you know, come on.
oh, well.
you do not know how to take care of her!
as I am taking it down, a woman catches me.
stanley, man the phones.
here we go.
hmm.
ok?
so just cut me some slack.
andy and angela seem very happy... i hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
that would be hot.
that girl's going to turn my hair gray.
and i treat him well.
so... just sit down kelly.
uh, nine.
well there is two things actually.
no evidence, no case.
i just do not get it.
yeah hope - grows.

heeeere's dwi- what the-?
fudge it up!
come on!
so bernie's, huh?
in a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they are done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
we are counting on ya.
there are new rules.
whoa.. wha... wait.
like i said, it is not about the horniness, it is about the loneliness.
what is black and white and red and can not think?
okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j jim halpert and i will fax it in to you... under you.
no.
and i am holding on to her leftovers.
no i did not, just please do not... may i enter the room?
i think you should do that.
you know what?
we had not even thought of that, had we boy?
so if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just do not hesitate to ask.
and a close personal friend of mine, jim halpert!
yes, so i know i told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I am, I am going to be leaving tonight.
i owe you one dwight.
we have a lot of fun.
hmm.. well, look, i am in an assigned parking place in front, so... alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.
yeah!
pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
take it back.
he is cool.
almost there.
because I am mighty?
dwight, you are handsome.
oh, oh, well here he is right now.
everything that i pass by, things that i witness on the road.
wow, really?
you leaked it?
oh, god.
michael, you know i can not take this.
un-shun.
I am an assistant to the regional manager.
i am so deliriously happy... because you are pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together.
but i would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm.
my grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things.
a lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
why is everyone else standing up?
why do not we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually.
got to go, i have to take this.
you are right.
yes.
have you ever tasted a shepherd's crook?

well, now ok, i know that this is probably not appropriate, but i need help.
damn it, i knew it!
and that is probably why most ads suck.
well, actually, I will see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
i bet he does that at home.
grab you here.
a boss's salary is not just about money, it is about perks.

is that clear enough for you?!
my cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.
cool.
yes.
michael, i need to talk to you.
you say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth?
I am in.
soon as i heard that wrapper.
i was not smiling that time and they can tell too.
merry christmas!
i love that.
twice.
because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we do not get downsized.
everybody hates me.
i have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before i get dressed i will tuck myself between my legs just to see.
no.
transfer!
i loved my father very much.
you liked it!
because you got a good life!
no.
at all?
i do not want somebody sucking up to me because they think I am going to help their career.
what a loser.
you can not help people.
you, too, dwight?
uh huh.
the entire cast of battlestar galactica is going to be here, including starbuck.
not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
you know what?
i used to say "do not go there" but that is... lame.
but not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
um, so, let us, uh, just read some of these suckers.
conference room, five minutes.
but, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.
and also, i want you to spread the word that i will have my digital camera.
it was great.
and here we have stanley the manly.
dwight schrute is manager!
no, no, no, no.
'scuse me.

first rule in road-side beet sales: put the most attractive beets on top.

what do you know?
oh, wow.
no, no... run what?
jo, i do not know how things work in florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.

cops can not do anything until a crime has been reported.
I will look it up myself.

ok, ok.  good.
i have two.
you dressed exactly like the servants.
plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.

who knows what I am going to say?
i can try.
it looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation.
it was beautiful and gentle and respectful.
uh, no, thank you.
how about later in the week?
it is like if michael phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
everybody settled in?
there is still one more thing we need to do.
yes.
wow.
krav maga four times a week.
oh, every man's dream.

i was looking at a trail map, and i was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I have never actually been skiing.
i made a miraculous recovery, which is more than i can say for him.
okay.
oh, pam with the dirty talk.
left brain, right brain.
yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says "I am going to make you the seventh mrs. rosenblatt" unless you ring this bell.

and you know why?
i guess they got what they want.

do not get bit.
good, good.

well, hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order.
what are you doing?
okay, you know what?
ok, so what i want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations.
that sounds like it was hilarious.
do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses?
[starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
hey,darryl.
perfect immune system.
lookin' good.
dang!
yep.
oh.
and perhaps, some pam-chops, with mint... I am looking for the toy drive box.
okay... I am hearing a little too much reverb.
hey, oscar.
so I am going to need you to give me the password to jim halpert's computer.
and i always have.
i made the connection.
what a business model too.
i have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
a great show.
all right jim.
and carol came over.
everybody convinced me that something was up.
wait, why are we stopping?
damnit, phyllis.
try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
very official.
she is hot.
go!
yeast infections.
"seasonal." well, the christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical.
i did.
oh, ugh.
come on phyllis.
illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay?
oh, my god.
been there, done that.
aha!
no no no no no no no.
he is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.
look, it is a dusting.
uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through may.
where?
jim, turn around.
and boom!
pick something else.
do you have a, uh, a cd player?
oh.
before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
good.
um... ryan needs his number for the count off.
i think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
whoa, angela!
i do not know, holly mentioned that there were some complaints.
no, i can not because we do not have any emergency contact information because pam said it was not a priority." think.
oh, i have gifts as well!
because it will help.
pam, it is michael.
well, it is a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
hey, i hired them!
but upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so i threw it away.
i used to be in hr.
god!
yeah.
which brings me to my main point and that is that i will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.
you know what that is?
and you do not have my numbers on speed dial.
ok, you know what?
i love your daughter, and i have for some time.
so would you guys like some lemonade?
you might remember testing my urine a few years back when i was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
you can not treat... thank you!
we... um... somebody has to stay here.
singles only.
all right, what are we talking?
all right, kevin.
it is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy.
andy!
i do not tell you how to do your job, do i?
i did it.
here is a box, for your things, but i doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.
mr. bart!
no no.
okay, i told you these guys had a sense of humor.
ooh, i want to hold the baby!
you are dead.
the key to a crisis is dealing with it right away.
I will just let it go to voicemail.
you have to pay for the actual course.
you just said it.
hello, you are back.
you said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
but right now we are talking to mrs. davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, stanley?
let us get back to this.
he treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
I am kidding.
no debate.
i guess i never thought about it that way, though.
good to see you again.
do good.
yeah!
stanley, are you having an affair?
but... hey, cece's toothbrush.
i know, i know, we will wait.
come on!
everybody gets dumped gabe.
birthday hug!
how can you be sure?
but it is hard for you!
this week we are rolling out the brand new sabre tablet....the pyramid.
and over here.. well, nothing.
okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.
i just feel like we have not talked in awhile.
yes.
well, there is no easy way of saying this.
well, thank you sir.
oh.
wow.
jesus!

that is, you know what?
yes.
um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost.
did you raise benefits?
cool?
i know, i know.
the important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win.
no!
how much do they want?
does that include the garage?
this is a classic... yeah, well, but i ... i feel like I have known you many lifetimes.
have you met that kid?
and finally... no, no, no, no, wait.
yes, andy.
you know what, why do not go around the room and say one memory of meredith.
I am not answering it.
we are to respect him.
ok, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go.
senor, are you happy with your-- have you-- have you considered satellite television?
oh andy, got to few questions for you.
ok. you will do.
yes i do.
yeah, happy times.
and until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
does not even matter.
you are very helpful are not you?
shh... the person carrying the egg will be blindfolded.
what is a nazi?
curse is broken people!
i need you to get better.
because she must want to shoot herself in the face.
because he was my boss.
great, right up there.
i do not know that there is anything left for us to talk about, esther.
what is happening to me?
hello, we have been expecting you, david wallace.
not my problem.
you do not have to wrestle him.
i hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
oh, no.
not that guy who murdered his mother.
half pants, right mr. franklin?
that is a good idea.
michael!
great, i mean, i guess you guys are working saturday.
we could have integrated more chuck into the presentation.
pack your bags, we are leaving the day-after-tomorrow!
coolio.
follow me, i will show you where all the slaves work.
gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
i wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because i was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
problem solved everyone.
want me to get down on one knee and beg you or- what?
get a nice bra.
they want how many spiral pads?
dragging sticks.
you and pam?
what did i say?
enjoy christmas with saint nicolas' rural german companion, belsnickel.
there is such a thing as good grief.
no no, he is doing it to catch the president!
jim has no discernible sense of humor, pam.
little bit of the comedy juice.
and it was not.
ok. what was dwight thinking?
this is my lawyer, james p. albiny.
you know what?
no, mose is fine.
no, that is a german woman named urkel grue.
how was my summer?
but the little cars go in the compact spot do you mean to me?
but, they really seem to be enjoying it.
this is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours.
oh, what is that?
oh, breakfast.
you have no idea what you are talking about.
amazing right?
do you understand that line of logic?
okay.
get the door.
i brought all your friends from the office dear.
who was the second man on the moon?
wow!
it is surprise meredith.
yes.
yeah!
right?
okay...  oh, no, no, no, no!
it is just the first... girl that popped into my head.
they suck.
that is the problem, that is the problem.
it is a pretty lame party.
but the good thing about the american dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
no, no.
i am going to sell to you in twelve minutes i will tell her what her needs are and then fill them.
i love you!
throw it.
i know you did it!
save room for ice cream cake.
you put the tv here, you put the family over here.
remember what i tried there?
thanks.
and i understand that you would want to just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
i do not like that at all.
welcome.
jim!
wow.
i find the rattle soothing.
la la la!
okay.
power.
you have to tell him.
a person who works in this office.
nailed it.
all right.
pam, let us go.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
looks like we have got no choice.
okay.
yes.
please tell me.
oh big deal.
"michael" "boss" and "funny".
fine.
no, why were you in there?!
andy?
i know.
they will melt right into your flesh!
...you can take a five, if you want.
our town car awaits.
we will see what dwight says.
why am i telling you my strategy?
sharper image is still considering it.
got it.
right.
is this the bus to mexico?
you forged the forms!
i got presents for everybody.
not a viable option.
no!
maybe I will see an accident one weekend?
no!
nobody?
jim and pam and cece really seem to be clicking.
oh my god, would not that be hilarious!
no, jim, you are in no condition to drive.
here is the language skills and cognitive development area.
its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out.
oh no, no, no, no.
i want one.
okay.
do not move.
there is a massive conspiracy going on here, and i know you are involved.
uh... hello!
phyllis!
let us not tell anybody about this right now.
apparently, there are allegations that sabre printers can because a fire.
oh.
he was a good guy.
second... yes, second, toby.
boom!
you know what this is like?
exactly.
he said that he loves going to work every day.
and i will carve the roast skunk.
jim, jim wrote, "meredith, i heard you are turning 46, but, come on, you are an accountant.
just whatever comes to mind.
mmhmm.
what about all these people, huh?!
do you know what this is for?
it would look good, on my mantle.
argggg!
sorry, i was just in the neighborhood, thought I would come by, see... i do not know.
correct.
yep.
i am king of forwards.
gay.
ugh.
ah, katy.
hi.
hello.
swish, swish, swish.
do not be.
whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
no, this is a power suit.
yeah.
i want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.
i got it.
killing my hand, there.
i mean, god.
well, theft and stealing.
would you come with me?
alcoholic.
happy halloween.
and i owe it to her to finish this... gd 5k  no, no!
phyllis, give me the ball.
you are kind of... dupee-doo, dupee-do.
my lips are sealed... bangles.
let us go in here.
so who gets paid more?
all right, fine.
everybody cool out there?
ok. alright.
oh, i doubt you will make it.
if it is consensual.
each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you.
all right.
you told me, that i lead a... cushy, wimpy, nerf life.
you know who my favorite character is?
nicely done.
this is b.s.
you have only seen it flat.
89... 88... you are twenty minutes late!
i did my job.
what does he know?
oh yup.
take my money.
that got infected even though i peed on it.
he is a valued member of this company... and you know what?
fine with me.
movin' on.
indubitably.
i got to them.
where do i go?
are we good?
never mind I will find it.
gay.
fine.
415-ycl.
you came to the exact right person for this.
we at sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers.
is not that crazy?
ok. obviously I am not going to do the twirl.
named for the good times you have when you are in it.
your car breaks down.
this cord has creed written all over it.
they might be listening to us you never know.
i will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
can you give me a second, sir.
um.
you are the rightful heir to schrute farms.
i wrote letters.
mose in socks.
not literally.
this is it, check that out, can you smell that?
okay?
I am not going to answer it oh, no, no, no, no.
that is inappropriate, pam.
it was part of the party.
okay.
game on!
uh, it is a sketch now.
have you ever made a sandwich before?
but that is her peariagative.
yes.
in all seriousness, todd packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch.
there is no movie called willy wonka.
dot com!
why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
i am the guy who roused that crowd.
and... i am going on vacation next week to cancun.
phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe i get to see her naked from the waist down." I am not even attracted to you.
okay, everybody, gather 'round.
I am just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.
um, here is the deal.
you have got to see this.
and today, that dream was shattered.
you know, a little morale boost.
keep it up.
everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it... this is my call jim, big picture stuff, it is about murder.
which puts me at a disadvantage, because i bring my own water to work.
who the hell is this?
what am i supposed to do?
oh hey!
who is next?
michael, could i talk to you for a second, please?
where did you hear that?
no, no, no....
there we go.
who is side are you on?
open the trunk.
that guy.
we did not get it.
and they know how to party.
yes.
i have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
her passwords are not going to be dwight, dwight.
before taxes.
are those a present?
you know what they say, keep your friends close.
you call your mom meredith?
you should feel my nipples.
hey, michael.
there are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
now, jim!
here is a kelly complaint: "ryan never returns my calls." ugh, join the club.
okay.
so i need a little treat for the gang.
there he goes.
what is the only thing worse than one hr rep?
oh, my god.
seriously, do you want me to just cancel the dundies?
alright, michael scott paper company.
the next time you see me, I will be working for corporate.
close them.
that is still going on?
ahhh.
ummm-hmmm... very easy to clean.
god!
god!
d-w-i-g-h-t. ok, you know what?
you have your lawyer there?
i most certainly did not.
michael scott you run the most profitable branch of dunder mifflin.
all right.
thank you.
so, konrad...  and away we go.
is there someone there?
his chair at his desk.
you know what?
actually... i have a bunch of these, good ones, that i did not use.
that is what I am saying.
i build you this temple to the human body, and you are lifting what, five pounds?
hello ry.
no.
you follow that guy to the people who is really really bad.
i will take care of that.
i do not know, it is just... i know.
you never forget.
michael scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
god, that is 3 things.
wha- use a what to cover the mouth?
good.
why do not you have some?
it is a toy, like a wish bone.
your loss.
dwight schrute, dunder mifflin.
um, her.
see how i did that.
is there no way we can get rid of him?
none of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay?
i love ladies, always have.
and pam and jim are my best friends and our kids play together.
ehhhhnt.
guilty!
we are down here.
yeah.
no, I am not going to settle down.
sounds great, i just think it is great.
damnit  kevin, give me those leads.
i really do not want to take the chill pill.
there was a tavern on the ground floor.
sits on a copier.
ah, great.
and i entertained dwight to no end with my bar stories.
who is seen that before?
what are you writing about me?
just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth.
and the reason i tell you this story.
dwight schrute.
please take note of the new color-coding system.
is it a collection of numbers and sales reports?
okay, go back to the annex.
that is a conflict of interest.
and once I am finished, it is over.
flower shops, fireworks celebrations... moolit gandala, carrage drive through central park... an electric car dealership.
you are are <i>not</i>, to see that boy, anymore.
this interview is over.
I am thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we will go month to month after that.
officers.
i hope there will be management parables.
what, uh... .
yes, you are.
what now?
care to celebrate with a drink?
thanks for lending me the books.
there is no way you are laughing at this.
dunder-mifflin is the big picture!
ha!
the michael scott paper company is broke.
dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
mm, that is not sexual, just... we are all professionals.
ah.
and if you tell me, that i have to drive back to scranton, to the satellite party, i am going to throw up!
here is a little tip for your performance review.
okay, no, that is not what we are going for.
maybe that- yes.
dwight.
oh, excuse me!
oh, no, i do not think this is it.
you are talking about jim and pam, if they are having sex, what it looks like, i know, i think-- hey, hey, hey.
you have the right to request judgment by combat.
just get in the car.
blindly.
.
hey, you know what would even be better?
he is running.
dwight, may i speak with you for a minute?
how did you know?
happy secretary's day.
I am willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy.
what happened?
ryan and i are just having some fun!
put a pin in that.
huh?
closed society.
we are a business.
because this is  really good, this is really good.
may i present... mr. dwight schrute!
oh, you sigh like january i broke jan's heart, david, and it was awful.
what is taking that guy so long?
okay, so you are tricking him into flying to florida?
huh.
well, we are going to recalling all of that paper.
so, I am not exactly sure how to say this... what are you doing?
my name is michael scott.
just stab  them on in there.
well, then i will get a warrantee.
really?
i think you have the wrong number, michael.
it is not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents.
and it is a dying business.
they are going to name the baby after you, you know.
you have stress?
ooh.
how convenient.
holly thinks that this relationship is over.
i want to show you something .
holly... you know, if we hung holly from the ceiling, we would have to kiss underneath of her.
you try to help everybody.
and if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.
admit it.
your boss is nice!
enough!
hey, is that healthy food?
no, i do not feel like it.
so you do not miss it.
i can not hear what he is saying, but he looks like he is really into it.
and now, i realize that you can program or download any ring you want.
are you mental?
this is where the story gets interesting: i tell tiffany to meet me in paris, by the trocadero.
my own personal dvd player and 20 movies.
ready?
i really appreciate it.
you take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.
this is dwight schrute.
this is none of your affair because she is your boss- and she is a woman.
whatever.
i mean, you remember my idea for the fourth pirates movie.
can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences?
he looks like your twin.
there is a lotta pressure on me right now.
let us think this through.
i do not say "hi" pam!
but this  seems to be... i know how.
we heard what you said.
it is beet vodka and it is delicious.
pass.
surprise!
i know she loves me, phyllis.
but, let us give her a round of applause.
phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
okay, let us go.
i do not see what is so hard to believe about that.
okay, okay, jim.
no, no.
so.
it is a nice little farm.
have fun tonight!
you are shouting it from the back of a horse!
look at that.
because um I am not nervous in front of them.
i did not see any heart.
okay.
but i figured I would rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.
let me tell you why i should be the next manager with a riddle: a manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant.
"i guess i missed you." i guess i missed you.
another announcement.
did i come from a woman?
her family admires me, my family tolerates hers.
is it because you know i love count chocula?
this is a dummy, a la ferris bueller's day off.
ah, still sends his own proxy.
or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
you notice it.
what are you talking about?
in the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields.
why would i put a banana in my holster?
pathetic.
and i can still crush that time.
ditto.
okay you know what you get?
pam, would you stand up for a sec?
i accept the outcome.
so you better tell me.
this place has gone to hell.
i stole.
i do not think we have finished with my inbox.
three.
and shake!
excuse me?
men from scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
i know, somebody will.
danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this.
any other questions?
and then we had sex.
ah, right here.
no he did not.
wait, what is this?
I have made myself a nice pants tent shelter.
sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
and what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
you know what?
yes!
woah, woah, woah.
bring the papers, I will sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
carol used to drink lattes.
i can not force you to go down but i can entice you.
wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.
i think that goes without saying.
are you saying you invented paper?
you are playing like a bunch of girls.
the chance to solve an actual crime.
numismatic.
why did you come back?
okay.
ohmmm my god if you are wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm... my goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for stanley hudson as i can.
oh, great.
go get your own thing.
that was not a shake, dwight.
why are you looking at me like that?
alright, let us listen to that again.
"did your mom ever see you naked?" so you can molest me?
yes.
that is not a joke.
you want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
that is what she said.
yeah I am fine.
i stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt.
ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention please.
the only thing I am worried about... is getting a boner.
i will trade you for the used candle.
like all human beings?
okay.
yes.
pam made me put a banana in my holster.
i did!
we are going now!
but my ancestors never worked in corporate america, and before that, hunters.
well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down.
good.
no mustard!
ye... pfff.
all right.
how you doing, jordan?
no!

a lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally  some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing  some people should not be in this business.
ok. thanks!
you know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
pam beesley ladies and gentleman.

this is probably the icebreaker you need.
you are not alone.
oh.
now, you are to use one check a year.

that is all i know so far, but I am going to keep practicing.
here we go.
i bet luke perry's friends do not treat him like this .
because i wanted you to come to me and say, "wow, he is so great." and i was going to say, "well, it is in the genes." and i was actually going to be wearing jeans.
mega-desk.
scranton.
boooooo.
what is the procedure?
and the sexy looks between you and pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it is creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
we got to do something.
oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he is been fermenting since the day of my birth.
michael scott.
oh hey, i forgot something in my car.
i was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.

85 acres.
okay, then i want pam back.

excellent decision.
purely carnal and that is all you need to know.
you just press the button.
we are here because there is something wrong with society.

yeah, well...we call it overkill.
three to four hours.
i do not need your help.
business-men.
you, way too manly.
you do like hard boiled eggs and i got one a those melon ballers  and i, it is just like a little ice cream scoop, and i just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.
that is a lot of zeroes.
it is her father's business.
oh... it is uh, a repliee q1 expo female robot, they are only available in japan.

but you had to have the afternoon delight.

now, if michael had studied the spidey principles that I would drawn up for him, jan's boobs might not be all over the internet.
interested?
wait, is it a full moon tonight?
give me, you guys... creed give me the ball!
kind of sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all.
see, this is a beautiful piece of material  this could be used for all sorts of things.
it is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so.
it was us?
forget it michael!
ohh, god!
all right.
your call, b. nice.
here we go.
putting a load on more like it.
you could have pretended to be chuck.
i have not seen kevin since we let him go.
wow.
take it away guys.
i opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
we do not report it at all.
i will not resign.
and her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
what are you- what?
you know what?
we have puzzles, string for cat's cradles.
no, no.
i just do not want you to lie to me.
i think...  that maybe you should... what I am saying is that, ok, see what i did?
you know what?
dar de- dar de dar.
i was thinking exactly the same thing.
shh... here is the door.
right?
val kilmer.
it is good to see you.
so all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
dwight!
so, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
we have three rooms, each with a different theme.
forget the question... i humbly accept the management position.
stop it!
he is going to kill the store?
you misconstrued me.
I am not going to leave until you forgive me.
nope, you cannot use it.
write it yourself.
a funnel?
it is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if i fall asleep, i still end up at home.
i know none of that.
trevor is great, but i saw no fire in him today.
permission granted.
i can not believe i gave her my bike!
pam.
well, we will see.
listen up.
that saved some time.
hello january wow, kevin, really?
she cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack.
are you done?
you can run, but you cannot hide.
dunder-mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
we are great together.
david, they do not believe me.
look over there.
you win, because you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go.
how are you?
you are not on <i>anything?</i> good.
i want to see some presents.
all i did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test.
you quit on christmas, christmas quits on you.
I am going to need to put you on hold for a second.

oh, come on!
battlestar galatica.

check for an organ donor card.
courtesy of dunder mifflin.
thanks for your time.
i am pam.
hazel.
"bend it like beckham." yeah.
for five years I have held my instincts in check because i wanted to be made manager.
hey, you know who you should be jealous of?
he would sing.
it is the most dominant.
no!
all right, um... sorry.
and for--oh, whoopsie daisy.
guys, I am scared.
again.
to be continued!
were you going to tell me that you hired james van der beek?
he is very trusting, he is looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
that is like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
i did not want to hear about it either, stanley, but i did and now i can not stop picturing it.
stop, stop.
all i had to do was sit here for six hours.
no.
just do it, okay?
I will be like three hours late.
case in point!
alright.
great film.
yes, i love both of those so much.
let us give this a shot.
marriage.
ok?
wait, wait, wait, no, i mean, if you need to know more, you can call david wallace.
i got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, pam, ok?
all we do is work... is work.
should have burned this place down when i had the chance.
women are attracted to power.
... aww, that... sucks, great.
i was scooperman, you were scoopy-doo.
yes i can.
it was awful.
because they are un-understandable.
okay!
oh, one more thing.
snack foods!
you are right.
move!
nice to meet you, bill.
on the other hand, i may have to deal with the dark unknown.
my fetish is signed drawings of butts.
i have not found that to be the case.
must eat more jims.
i do not want dwight!
if i can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
"do not sl-", ok, that is blank  do not, just put it- i do not understand why you are so upset.
in my contract, it is stipulated that i provide a temporary work space.
listen to me, you are not doing this for me, you are not doing this for you, you are not even doing this for them!
what table should we take?
shhh... i know that you are probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
he forgot to mention the herpes.
michael, you should not have to settle.
erin is just weird.
yeah!
conference room, five minutes.
runaway train, never come back.
it is not really 1992 anymore.
so, uh, dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
you could do whatever you want to do.
that is a shawl.
I will be in my office if you need me.
well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
come -- come with me.
well, tell me about jocelyn.
oh, god.
my girlfriend tara, who lives in new york city.
under the right manager, that is not a bad team.
I am in the interior of the vast pennsylvania wilderness.
whooo, nice.
go!
well some of us are trying to have a... well i will turn up the volume.
oh, you are kidding me!
come on!
fine.
you want to give back to society.
what?
stop.
i remember you told me that you loved the willy wonka movie when you were growing up.
but david, listen to me carefully.
i am the good guy.
you.
these tables tarted up like victorian whores!
okay.
and i have a personality, where as you...  yes, andy?
woah, wow, who told you that?
no, that was inadvertent.
and now you can not return it.
who is doing the presentations?
getting back on the market.
what?
what?
go, go, go!
you guys are all gigantic losers.
thank you.
you know who i really like?
i took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life.
yeah.
yeah!
also, i can retract my penis up into itself.
he did not tell me till years later.
are you kidding me?
i got that off the internet.
on the phone.
indian.
it is... pssssh... .
you are an idiot.

and the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
you are talking to jim.
</p> curly?
"statistical correlations exist between emf radiation and various health hazards.
the... no, no.
to obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. erin, let me see your birth certificate.

what about you?
does not matter.
alright, I am going to, uhh, get a cup of coffee.
yeah, yeah he is the worst.
dwight...  you just keep your eyes on the road.
right?
well, if you could do me a big favor and tell mr. schofield that michael scott has tickets to the wilkes-barre penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... hello, daniel.
and I will use the paper to write my memoirs.
one more bite of eclair each.
shame, jim.
check that one out.
because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
all right, I will help you.
bob, how old are you?
alan brand is the ceo of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to new york to the shareholder's meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors.
you never know about the press.
dwight, please, please.
let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth.
well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?
d-e-a.
we called it "hay place".
you know what?
okay.
i need you to go back to bed.
you once told me that andy and i had different strengths.
that is...  suck up!
sure thing.
you heart n.y., right?
yeah!
since when is comfort the most important thing?
i bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you would never touch  them, because of your condition.
do not you want to know your present?
take a good look at this boy... ...because you are never going to see him again.
just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
ah, good stuff, good stuff.
jerry.
this is for real this time.
that is what christmas is all about.
i am offering up my services to you all.
but will be..  no, no, meeting's not over.
eh, I have been sitting all day.
of course.
let us see.
like who?
sorry.
you are wrong.
right now, you are like 'oh, what is more important?
and probably god would be the fourth one.
what do i write under "reason for visit"?
yeah!
you are the stupid one.
so tender.
where do you want to be?
oh i did.
like my need to be praised.
i will call you when it is time.
...poop my pants.
hot sake.
i was not attempting to compliment you.
you do not what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back.
yeah.
nellie let me bobble-ize him.
this is what all good law enforcement officers dream of.
you are being weak and ineffectual.
sky mall's considering it.
do you understand, you forced my hand?
hi.
I am kidding.
pump it!
right?
satan is a master of lies.
jan and i broke up.
i love this woman!
no, I am a regional manager-- no-- my-- ok, this is insane.
please.
darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.
just-in time.
you guys are so beautiful.
you need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it is going to drive me insane.
okay, give it to me.
no.
so, okay.
it is ew.
umm, all of the children of the world.
silence.
she did it!
i spent a lot of dough.
i love it.
andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
my wife do not get no respect, some-take her, please, for example.
goodbye toby!
quality assurance.
ok. that is ok. that is not a problem.
... what?
that is stupid.
and because you are gettin' old.
good clothes.
he is not the worst, okay?
hypothetically, if i were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means?
people have been filtering in and out.
a loaf of bread?
aaaaaand, go!
flint... parka... tent, rainfly, gorp... mmmnnnnmmm... thank you michael.
I will have a bottle of the antacid.
really shoving our faces in it this year.
where are you sitting?
no, i did not intentionally get you drunk.
remember clark.
think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen.
ok, no catfights.
drop that sucker.
I am the man for this job.
let me rephrase that.
dwight, could you move over a little bit.
is this the tape of me falling?
while i describe to you the excalibur package.
how could it be more clear?
had conversation with michael about taking credit for an idea that was not mine.
makes me question the whole judicial system.
you will all stay at your desks until that time.
this is dunder-mifflin paper company.
i wished for pam to gain courage.
let us roll.
two, incest.
it is a miracle.
i do not need your help!
he has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder.
it just matters that you are saying something that people care about.
we want -- ok, alright.
reinstituting casual friday?
phyllis!
and the second guy says, "well, i am a pimp, so i drive a cheap escort".
and i would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me.
it is my fault.
exit options.
but i do not see it that way.
he was much more articulate and that was better.
you are welcome.
that- that was a bluff, um...  listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I am going to poach one of yours.
is everyone ok?
i always say, "you want something done right?
or women, present company excluded.
let us keep it moving!
you would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
hey hey hey.
you can talk to me for as long as you want.
it was pretty mixed.
i like to stay tight.
okay.
i pick...  me!
the waitress tripped on the cord.
what do you have in mind?
yeah, I am good.
I am just... it is a common question.
or is it crazy?
perfectly balanced.
or making love too beautifully.
that is a mis- that is a misdirection.
uuuuh... well.
almost made it.
no, i mean afghanistanis with aids.
actually better than a five-star hotel because you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.
next.
what?
come on, i do not have all day.
well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
why did you send her away?
ah, okay.
missed you as part of our family.
yes, jim, i do.
just shoot.
hey, how is it going?
yeah.
stinkyfeetville.
mm-hm.
oh.
i thought michael scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
am i scared of getting hit in the face?
and they could all go home early?
hey!
that is super-clear-ish.
whew, wow i was so nervous about this i do not think i ate for three days.
yep.
we are having fun.
did you really think i would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?
and now we are wasting tape.
hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned hay king.
this is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will.
and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss.
it was in all the papers.
listen, about the tickets.
that sounds like a fantastic idea.
i can not do thursday.
hey, pam.
queer eye.
you know what?
throw your poop.
man, they got us so bad.
last year, idiot!
we did not need them touching our asses.
okay.
what are those?
and we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it is deangelo the whole time!
you know me very well, dwight.
you are weird.
hi, pam.
look right here , it is an old sales trick.
go ahead.
halfway!
dwight!
yes!
it is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty.
why?
come oooon... son of a bitch.
I am not listening to music!
cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
we are not- okay.
ok. see you soon.
i, but if there were, I would be protected as assistant regional manager?
where things are.
nothing but gruel.
mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
why just michael?
or a major insurance carrier.
well, the only thing we are planting here is dead bodies.
oh, ok, here is a good one.
deangelo, what are you doing?
delightful.
because look at this normal sized coffee cup.
i can always block the blow.
any other questions?
today?
you are so brave.
it can wait.
ok, wendy.
and... boom.
with that i can buy... half the menu.
I am the bad guy.
um... that is it!
mm.
that is what i said.
ergo de facto.
good.
hey.
okay, you know what i want to do, i want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle.
pam.
i want meredith to get better.
thank you, dwight.
you are... you are worried about the cop's time?
i am going to love it.
i love escorting people.
we are going to listen in on darryl's presentation to the warehouse.
whoa!
i cannot work with jim anymore.
okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
first thing, we are going to stretch the pelvic bowl.
"i pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." i do believe... in that part of the pledge i that just read.
I am going to kill myself!
do not tell me, tell them.
you are almost there.
a lot!
you find it?
but let us just say that jim was lying about jury duty.
you are out of order.
yes, hello.
parkour!
number three: eat a frog.
filing?
right?
yes.
somebody got donuts for my birthday!
I have taken my downstairs office and i have turned it into a place to hang out.
guys!
gotcha, oh!
you would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
newborns are slippery.
no!
you are a liar.
i do not think she would be missed.
done.
oscar, you do not know what the hell you are talking about.
it takes an advanced sense of humor.
pam, listen.
and... i have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly.
yeah, oh, hope not!
I am thirsty!
i was a greeter.
you can not tantalize me.
that is incredible!
you lost a ton of weight, literally.
yeah.
hi!
i just, you know, times are tight.
um, sort of a spy, thriller... thanks, no, i have work tomorrow morning.
having trouble finding a vein?
jim, could you wrap it up, please?
same thing.
no, no, it is great.
you are a a good guy.
that is a stupid game.
i just need andy to think it is his idea.
oh!
no problem.
you do?
mmhmm, okay.
wolf is hilarious.
i did not think you had it in ya.
i... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, i knew that it was wrong.
same thing happens with my cows if i do not tend them frequently enough.
dwight come here.
can i have a gun?
i told them that if they graduated from high school, i would pay for their college education.
is if we built a loft.
ask them about the toys on my desk too.
no one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, pam.
the next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift.
he tortured me... with his awfulness.
that is impossible.
yes!
na... no.
i thought you had to pee.
you want to go for a ride?
all right.
andy?
assembling a crack team.
i was having a nightmare.
no, of course not.
what about you, phyllis?
here she comes.
I am barren, jim.
so suck on that!
yeah, i know.
thousands of people have done it, and i am going to do it.
dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.
do not think about it.
mallard.
i started a fire, i started a fire.
no, dwight.
alright, that is the way you want it.
ok. 'oooh.
and the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.
andy, hi.
or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat.
dude, where is my office?
ok. kelly, how are you?
where are we?
i read small business man.
i think you are really going to enjoy it down there.
god!
um... no.
that would have been really embarrassing.
because you are beautiful.
what kind of name is a.j.?
sorry.
occasionally I will hit somebody with my car.
what do you mean?
oh good.
and they would come down, and they would suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
ok, um, can you just tell me please?
do you hear that?
we came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
dad?

okay, this is it.
we did.
i am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.
and i am baaaack!
but i have to consider pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker i can not in good conscience continue to date you, when i know what this is doing to her.
it seems a little foggy.
but you will... you will know it when you see it.
all right?
if only michael had children.
oh, man, never thought I would say this but i think i ate too much bone marrow.
what is so wierd?
yeah.
and, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when i was born.
wow- i will.
I am right here, I am right here.

i think you go camping by yourself-- in the wilderness.
that is what she sai   nope, but... okay.
better safe than sorry.
that is right!
still raw.
you know, it would be fun.
and... uh, she is our receptionist.

i have to say, i like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
that is her fault.
psst!
cow, goat or sheep.
that is true, that is true.
alright, so, teams forming.
it looks terrible.
i have not gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.
someone propose a plan.

everyone, hold on!
that... exists?
good.
you are a good man.
no women or children, unless provoked.
what the hell?
man, how long have we been sitting here?
i know, but I have been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it would might help me out.
what did you really think, honestly.
I will take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just- okay.
hey, hey, hey stop it.
sure.
you know what?
at first i drove myself crazy thinking about the things i should have done differently.
no one is going to here me.

wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is.
it is a big deal.
no.
okay.
everybody leaves?
not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I am not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and i can lead us there, and that is all that matters.

well, why not?
what is meredith's problem?
do you like the sebring-- how dare you?!
okay.
it was all the stuff that i said.

daryl.
we will find another way, we will ask power-point.
that is my girlfriend.
I am michael scott.
okay.
pull up next to each other, give each other the finger... moon each other.
you are just a bunch of voyeurs.
look, it does not matter what you say.

me, me, me.
he hated himself.
oh!
calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike.
where is michael going?
dwight.
i like the people i work with generally, with four exceptions.
kelly, if you tell me, you will be punished less.
because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.
it is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
come on.
hmm... look at her smile.
okay... yes.
break protocol!
it was great.
mm.
it is a deal.
mose is sorry too.

emotionally and sexually and... orally and i am not used to relationships going this well.
umm... oh!

come on, break this up.
it is really technically proficient but really there is no heart or soul in it.

you me?
i am michael scott, co-manager.
ow!
my gift is forthcoming, pam.
well monkey, he is a real minister.
you would not arrest a guy who is just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
oh, no.
he is molesting people via the internet.
oh, that is not appropriate.
dwight is confusing you.
this is about a very cool hr initiative that if we do not follow, we are all going to die of obesity.

why do not we... pump some iron?
a one-on-one lunch with erin?
i know.
she is got - i do not know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.

it was my pants.
sabotage.
technically, we fell asleep in the same bed.
that is how it is done.

but more than that, i realized that... i could not take a job that would take me away from this place.

but seriously, if you break that girl's heart i will literally kill you and your entire family.
yes, sure they do, dwight.

no.
no, it is a perfect smell-alike.
i have a couple of friends still on the force.

i was good.
what do you know about meredith?
come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
i... i sang her, her favorite songs.
keep it on there for another five minutes.
now open your eyes.
if sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations.
the democratic primaries, can not beat a horse.
you... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by...  and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well... one more time.
you know what?
no, well can you get on that, because i do not just read cracked.
ok. who reports to who?
i do not look worried.
it is, um... i know, it is very, very personal... i knew it.
although that will change.
woop!
why jim?
oh, sorry, mate.
ok, feel better.
dwight schrute.
i will talk to you on the bluetooth the entire trip.
come on!
excuse me.
that is the whole day.
you guys think donna's cheating on me?
and make it your own.
important show.
but you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way.
no.
these things sell themselves.
oh, thank you.
um... why do not you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
i am asking nicely- rolph, leave it alone!
this is a nice temperate florida morning.
jim, this may be the last christmas that we have here, does not it make you a tiny bit anxious, me not playing santa?
alright!
business is always personal.
we just sort of got caught up in the moment.
let us start meeting- hello.
ok. alright.
thank you very much.
goldenface is going to blow up the nhl all star game tomorrow.
no, I am not calling your weirdo cousin.
oh man, you should order milk.
you all do it.
let us try a little... little social experiment here.
it is not been a blockbuster year for me financially.
now all off a sudden he is cinderella of the office.
she could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
what do you grow in here, bullcrap?
then I will give you away!
this is good.
when i said before that i was king of forwards, you got to understand that i do not come up with this stuff.
I will make you a tape.
do not talk about nazis in front of-- you know what?
oh, holly does not need luck.
three, two, one- five, four, three, two... now.
okay, good-bye.
if jim has bedbugs, that means they are everywhere.
ed's tires.
answer, maybe, but maybe not.
he had to follow his heart!
what?
aaahhh I am burning, help me!
so, um, one of the clock sharp and we have got a game on.
well then it is a happy ending, because he was gay.
i have been hustled.
sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard.
one more.
i think you have a great accent.
why do not you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
do not give me that.
yesterday i was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel.
help!!
yes, i am choosing my apprentice.
ryan is probably, like, a two.
nobody cares what you think.
although, publicly i am going to retain the assistant regional manager position.
what?
you needed to speak to me?
sure.
maybe.
fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.
damn... it.
as a farmer, i know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery.
everyone remain calm!
yeah why do not you send that to him in costa rica?
because i am busy taking you out.
and i did not have to deal with missy elliot.
i never abused my power.
I am an adult, i do not have to think or do anything.
I am a big believer in people being here more.
it is those online paper jerks.
ha, ha, ha.
captain jack is gone.
no, the country.
we are back.
oh, oh, oh.
oh... oh!
please do not do that.
yes.
I am going to live for a very long time.
I will make a reservation.
ok... meredith,  ooooohhhhh.
nope.
is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
what is happening?
i disagree, i think it was very valuable.
de-fense!
box seats as usual.
and i can not stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
oh come on.
so... yes, you did.
that is a shame.
exactly.
have a good weekend.
thank you.
oh my god, oh god!
oh, no big deal.
will you?
they are jealous of two people in love on valentine's day.
hypocrite!
ok. alright.
the two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
sometimes... ...you just gots to get your freak on.
you are not stupid.
wish us luck.
step 5,  ...the wound.
you will.
we will still get to use the little cups, though, right?
you do it.
and elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.
yes, i was watching jim's face.
i have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called shoe la la.
all right, bye.
dwight, what are you drinking?
it is so on!
that... is miss trudy.
it does not matter.
twenty- seven!
i... love it!!
sure.
nobody better try to stop me.
jim?
they are lithium.
a pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
well, that depends on how old she is.
this is going to be good.
leave the keys!
so... hey hey hey!
ohh.
all right, everybody stretch out a little bit.
i got sofa.
i see you are begging for mercy, huh?
i never sit down during sales  meetings.
like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.
really?
hey guys.
i will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone.
where is my cornbread?
so maybe we should call.
brangelina is the brad pitt and angelina... roy... roy and pam.
this is the party.
exactly!
here to trade... absolutely.
let us see yours.
damn you.
yes, and hear me, dwight, when i say i brought you into this world, and i can take you out.
well, no.
investing in real estate.
exactly.
but, at the end of my life, when I am sitting on my yacht, am i going to be thinking about how much money i have?
to test the aspect of my job that i think is the most important, something i call the bob hope factor.
nice catch.
you know what?
i am telling you this because i care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly.
you know there is a ghost in this office a woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. haddie mcgonagle.
pam, please take a note that andy is patriotic.
look... the guy, "mr.
i spy?
I am just... i, i can not even imagine... the... thing.
huh?
where you from?
growing up, i always thought i would become an actor.
dunder mifflin.
we are like animal house.
no, no.
so... do the math.
and?
come on!
happy diwali!
no.
i will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
come on.
and i need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
okay.
I would like to apply for a loan.
come on.
i had to make andy my number two.
when two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
ok, ready?
was it worth it temp?
sniffling how?
and a woman, sort of a, i do not know, missy elliot type, grabbed the jacket.
they are correct, sir.
nonono, no, no, i do not want to hear moaning.
i respect him because he reminds me of somebody.
this is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
do you see my hat?
alright.
what is the meaning of this?
man, i like this worker.
you have got to stay for the big presentation we have got this young wiz kid -- ryan.
uh, i want to congratulate the happy couple.
me no want to hear that, january because downsizing is a bitch.
you can not expect them to be careful every time.
oh.
okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
ha!
good.
now, I have always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here .
i got it from newyorktimes.com so i happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office.
no, no!
camisole?
i just, i need to know a little bit more about my friend.
dunder mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named sabre.
so then you will not mind if tonight i just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh.
sorry.
let us hear it!
you call that diversity training?
because at the end of the night, brad or angelina would have to come and pick him up and i would get to meet them.
life is precious.
knit like the wind.
really dead.
no, no, no, no.
it is like last week i was at the video store.
tonight's event is to benefit the boy scouts of america.
i hate looking at your face!
jackpot.
like the old lady from titanic.
what makes them so good?
ha ha!
i do not know if you can... ...make much of out of it, creed.
i have made this spear, with which i will impale my dinner.
you are my best friend.
you hungry?
thirty years later, i get a postcard.
uh... uh, okay.
hello.
oh pam.
inspirational.
oh, hey.
no thank you.
oh.
that was hilarious.
you need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
no, no.
ok, seriously.
scranton is not lame.
i can prove it!
aaagh, aaagh!
jim was lying about jury duty.
is that clear enough for you?
good.
they say that laughter is the best medicine so stanley, you can throw away those pills.
that is so great about the bonus!
this is where i saw that deer last week.
dwight schrute.
ryan?
when?
and for a tech company, press can only mean one thing - bloggers.
well, what can you do?
and then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
whatever.
you call your friends "retards" when they are acting retarded.
what is wrong with me today?!
i do not want to work, i just want to bang on this mug all day.
I am not.
good.
pool, over here.
highest priority, triple-urgent.
ah!
and what is that?
I am an awful guy!
okay, everybody listen up!
you call that a sales call?
there is plenty for everyone.
hey, does sasha have a godfather, because i... oh... kay.
caucasians, am i right?
ohh... ok, everybody out.
not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.
what are we still doing here?
oink the pigs, that is very important.
am i doing the wrong thing?
i have an old barn!
what is the point of that?
no way.
stay below the smoke line.
okay.
like cantaloups.
let us proceed.
hey, looks great babe.
would you like a sandwich?" these people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.
this is closing on a condo, it is completely personal.
and i want kids.
this is dwight schrute.
where is armani?
and also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.
so you have to get home to wash your sheets  because they are yellow and they are wet with your urine.
okay, great!
he really is, but not for long.
you have already been several times.
i just- oh my gosh.
jim taught me this really cool way to take it.
yup.
yeah.
and now roy and pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, toby.
it belonged to my grandfather.
so... it is an analogy.
the only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and i am not robbing the cradle.
well just as long as it means jim becomes a manager.
what.
creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel?
but come on, i mean, darryl is far more ethnic.
embezzle.
go ahead and just read the frosting.
I will tell you what this is like.
who is it?
it slipped out of my hand, what a whiff.
and always keep the power in the conversation.
come up here.
it could be an old person.
i need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without ryan and pam knowing.
not me.
nitrous?
yeah.
well, you kept- going into nuclear something; that is not where the scene was going.
i thought i understood women, but maybe, can not believe I am going to say this, maybe, women do not understand themselves.
it knows what you did!
oh.
the vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.
you sorta disappeared there for a while.
i do not know how they did it.
you knew about this all along, did not you?
penguin power.
holly has to go back to colorado.
i wrote that.
hi, january hello, baby.
site blockers.
he is a homosexual.
all right, here is the deal you guys.
i did not lose my desk.
you do not have to display that.
good morning.
he would not listen to me if you want to fire him, you are going to have to tell him yourself.
see what you leave me with here, jim?
no, it is not that bad.
kendall, my main man.
so call me back, when you get this.
oh coffee, that is too much.
funtivities!
you know, i would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
I am glad we are finally on the same page.
who else?
yes.
she said she was going to give it to him right now.
i think angela might be gay.
nice to meet you.
incentive.
him or me?
rolf, come on.
a statue.
i am dead inside.
i can do both.
every morning i email the day's security codes.
you need to think this through in  jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
or at least business associates -"  chinese?
they say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.
very good.
no, I am not going to call january  she would just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... who told you that?
what?
i do believe you have me mistaken, my name is caleb crawdad.
that is lloyd.
do not take it out.
totally private.
yes.
good boy.
I will, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.
we will demonstrate on pam.
you listen good.
thanks.
broken nose!
um... yeah.
i... jerks do not deserve to be on pedestals.
boom.
and we need to stop him.
I would like to go around the room and have us each express to meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.
if you were driving a transam, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
here we go.
let us go.
i....
hold on a second, cynthia.
do the boobs!
blah, blah, blah, blah... ...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome!
all right!
of course.
oh that so - that was really messy.
let us do this thing!
look out for me.
do not- testify.
everybody, david wallace and i have talked and we have decided to promote jim to the position of co-manager.
yes.
erin, can you give us a second?
yes!
shut up.
that was not what you were saying to me.
if she is, it is working.
very good!
the michael scott paper company.
but i do not acknowledge him.
um, i do not see how that is unprofessional.
what is the ratio of stanley nickels to schrute bucks?
mose is my cousin and he lives here.
so yeah, I am doing great.
oh... god...  god!
what is that?
he might do it... i dare you to.
there is no such thing as playful hazing.
lots of e-mails to amazon, lots of wasted computer space.
okay, listen up all you dunder-mifflinites!
yep.
someone attack me.
my grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm.
please, do not want to spoil it for anybody.
this is not the surprise.
in an ideal world, i would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
hey!
no!
so you are the lawyer, mr. of'malley?
come on, man?
I am kneading it!
no, no, no, i finished all of that.
dwight, do not you have anything?
this has to do- I would like to lodge a complaint.
if you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
everybody'd go.
mm-hmm.
how do whalers do it?
interesting choice... a bat!
we even like the same girls, some of us.
do not you cap that pen.
attention, everyone.
what is: we are fine?
I will escort you!
am i a small number person or a severance package person?
i am so happy right now.
i always thought that i was going to defeat you somehow.
okay.
i have left dunder-mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market.
and the 20 little conversations that i have with stanley.
hold that thought.
I am sorry pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
snl?
they were so happy down there.
this is ridiculous.
shut up about the farm.
those are show bales, not play bales.
they are smaller than we are.
come on.
you are not going to.
ladies, not your best effort.
you should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year.
well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
oh.
angela, no!
i hope it will fit, with all these little knickknacks.
good to see you.
that is what i want you to write down in yours.
yeah.
she is dreaming.
who is he calling?
an age or month?
this smells of fraud to me.
you know what phyllis, i think you need to step it up.
so, uh, so what is the vibe?
really?
it is the most important position.
dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of essos as featured in the superb home box office series, game of thrones.
no, do not give him... just, did you hear anything i said?
let us go in here.
i know, i know.
i am going to donate to afghanistanis with aids.
who is d. abramson?
I am right... I am at the bar.
dun-der.
which is fine.
you can not.
sandwich platters.
if we are going to work together, we need some ground rules.
oh, she is hot.
so it is not a free fall?
what?
what are you looking for?
let us put it this way.
make a note.
let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
the eighty or ninety years that i have left in this life...i want to spend with you.
i have no idea.
oh right.
last week i gave a fire safety talk.
hey hey, i do not go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers.
no.
the office is at a crossroads.
thanks for asking.
they might be listening to us.
are we going to do it?
well, all right.
can not we all just get along?
it is going to be worldwide.
sure.
finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing i have ever had to do.
alright, let us get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
that is right.
alright.
yes?
it is got good solid construction.
it is a feral barn cat.
phyllis!
mhmm.
do not talk to them.
quiz me up.
great.
meh, exactly.
ryan and i have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against jim.
like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion.
you just made an enemy with the wrong guy, dwight.
and hospitals slash manufacturing.
I am filled with good ideas.
come on, come on, let us go.
i mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this.
no.
ahoy.
ah, what is hanging?
see what i mean?
if there are any left over, you can buy one later.
wah!
ok, here is the dream team.
fifty years, she is the best.
and I am very, very proud of that.
will you help me work out this knot?
okay, one.
you ready?
yeah.
he was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
i can not stop myself from kissing her.
who is your daddy?
you have a bad imagination.
this has been a test of our emergency preparedness.
we are in the middle of a party.
okay, part of the problem was that toby talked at you.
because i have two, basically.
okay, then we have two closets.
what do we got?
take the drums.
people who will not be missed.
a real hoop dreams story you got there.
yep.
phyllis!
people, i know models!
this ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core.
ok. all right.
that is what i said.
you know what?
could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that do not have blood in them?
yeah.
damn it temp!
ugh, that is so annoying.
yes.
me you?
what?
the only reason i am standing out here right now is because i do not want to take the elevator with her.
alright, relax.
it is just... brrrrrr... it is "amazing race," phyllis.
toby flenderson is doing drugs.
um.
no, i do not mind.
huh.
andy, i can not hear this right now.
why at least?
hellooo?
who would eat who in an 'alive' situation.
it means "excellent".
let us gooooo!
carol?
why do not you introduce me to your little friend?
do you-do you have cravings?
I am not going to cry.
tell them what you told me.
yet.
i do not think I am overstating it when i say that toby is a plague on this company.
thank you very much, thank you.
stat.
you are falling for it.
did you just stagger off the street?
okay, we are trapped.
shut up!
mmhm.
no, no, no... no, no... i do not like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
and this is not a joke.
she is not playing the game.
you are losing you.
ryan?
where are the yams?
fact: i love grape soda.
no!
sorry to interrupt.
but she is coming by today.
you are fired.
just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.
no, it is not beef... just... sit down, please.
what happened in there?
but the next day they feel great.
i was afraid i would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
yeah, go ahead and stop.
I am fine, I am fine.
oh, um, potato salad.
he is ruin... he is butchering it.
uh, better ask jim.
right, yes, yeah.
hey, hey!
uh, uh, not my problem.
i mean, he is up against my buddy rolf, for god's sake.
i look around and i see all these beautiful people who are alone on valentine's, and i think that there are other single people out there too.
people do not just take barrettes off.
yeah, yeah.
i do not even know how to say this, but cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. and that is not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
a woman santa, where does it stop?
thanks.
yeah, well, i owe you that at least, right?
look at that.
what are you doing?
wow.
you are no tracker.
in the office right now as we speak.
i suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus.
phyllis and angela and meredith are helpers.
teamwork!
i am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then i take it to gabe.
it is too early to tell.
shh... yes, i know, i know.
no, we are not.
a simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter... exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
yeah.
you know what?
irrelevant.
okay.
we will wait.
now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.
do you want an m&amp;m?
and I am treating ryan the same way.

ok?
pam stepped up.
i am what i am, oscar.

and you said, "i do." and i said, "i do." and andy was not signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
i want a sebring.
huh?
every day i brief nellie on what is going on in the office.
we are going to the hospital and we are going to have a baby.

for the record your mom came on to me.
that waitress was the one.
that is it.
hello!
i can deliver food.
you use your brain too much.
yes!
it works.
okay.
there is this yellow zigzag that does give ryan the authority to discipline stanley... however, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak.
you bring dip?
yeah.
and people do not understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
alf, you know, i might have actually been probed by alf.
mm-hmm.
yeah, i noticed that.

just keep living your lives.
boom.
mose, hey, it is dwight.
yeah... uh, come in.

i think it is kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
hey, look at that.
excellent.
w-w-wait.
dwight, hey.
jim, let us go.
oh, i forgot.
you have till five.
why do not you take a tour?
we will see.

mmmmm... my eyes!
just, do it for stanley.
i- i just want to say that i cannot believe that i walked into a koi pond.
no, no, no, no.
because phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as santa.
how did you get this number?
shut up.
um... yeah.
more than the bible, I am not surprised.

that is exactly what you are not supposed to do, damnit!
i should talk to her.
but you are the best salesman, on the inside.
you can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they have already gotten, like the oven mitt.
no.

solid fellow.
you think they would help each other out like that at corporate?
boom, case closed.
i do not know.
hi, I am michael scott, dunder-mifflin.
well you do not need two of you to do that.
and say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
oh, you know what?
amazed.
ok. four months ago, i dated a woman named holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I have even considered getting back into that arena again.
i can not... this is why I am a volunteer sheriff's deputy and you are not.
there goes mister poop.
okay, just throw out all the empties.
what is going on?
which is not technically the same thing as the nazi party.
somebody is found the hog maw.
i love you, angela.
so the baby could be anybody's.
miss you.
from jim.
yes.
i understand that he did not receive the promotion.
holly, come on in.
what did you say?
look, prison stinks, is what I am saying.
um, before i tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
thank you.
but the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
what is it?
break it!
phyllis.
i never said it was better than an ipod.
and i want it to be oscar-specific.
thanks for asking.
come here please.
you do not work with us.
dwight told charles.
philly, work with me here.
sir, would you do the honor?
but you know what?
no, no.
and she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, i guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of dunder mifflin, scranton.
david!
how do i not make any more of it?
where were you yesterday after work?
I am serious.
thank you very much.
"too soon for arabs." maybe next year.

i thought i was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
oh man, not good.

no, no.
what does it say under martial arts training?

some idiot named mark greg sputnik will claim credit for it.
oh, hey what is this?
we have talking walls.
okay, skippy, here we go.
nice job!
are you warmed up?
thanks for having me.
but we need money coming in every week.

what is a bad idea?
we will give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
michael!
you know what?
people are mixing, a lot of hope.
stanley hudson and his mistress cynthia!
no.

friends fight.
i have no way of knowing if that is true.
okay, i have a good thing with the mom- she is right on my way home from work.
a dream team.
this is ridiculous!
really?
mm.
erin, i am so glad that you trusted me.
oscar, we once sucked face in public.
this is dwight schrute.
no, that...for the sake of the story.
and his name is... garbage.
you never yell at the client.
well i do not have all the pieces yet.
no!
maybe beavers.
idiot, we are starting back up.
have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?
jim, great real.
300 going twice.
you are stressed, and I am taking you to lunch.
oh!
yeah, obviously you are.
i remember every second of us.
what i am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are.
he is always up in my bidness.
he is just, he is a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
but you still work for wired, right?
and there are clouds.
well, jerry, the one who got away.
you try and hurt mozart; you are going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of butch cassidy.
they use cocaine.
both sad.
i think this whole thing with sabre is going to work out.
you should!
your company is losing clients left and right.
temporary workspace.
i do not need it.
here we go.
you know what?
yo soy cancun.
the electric city.
how there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but what the hell everybody!?
what did you get?
i wanted to talk to you in private because i wanted to ask you out on a date.
no!
now that i own the building, I am looking for new sources of revenue.
alright, meredith, take off your dress.
how are you doing?
nothing stresses me out.
i hope it is understood that that will be our only topic of discussion.
no, that would not be- yeah.
okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.
you heard me!
okay.
and then what?
that is great.
like a beach blowout?
i knew it!
congratulations meredith.
guys ragging on each other.

welcome to our humble abode.
i think it is because they respect me.
go, oscar.
i am great.
i have plans that night.
seven dwarfs.
i do not believe you.
uh, you know, he is not a member of the full staff so, uh, ryan you want to just step outside?
when i said that i wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did i do?
i guess i missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant.
i will... i love you too.
yeah, yeah... you know what?
ok, i am going to tell michael and this entire office will be punished!
what is this?
how can i get you to stay?
yes they were living together.
any questions?
you okay, robert?
okay, can you tell the manager that I am keeping his delivery kid until i get a discount on the eight pizzas i ordered.
when i was growing up it meant lame.
listen,  do not forget to fill out those cards.
we have to have the same weight distribution.
it is an outrage, that is all.
this car is an investment.
it has to be official, and it <i>has</i> to be urine.
please i told you to get rid of the cell phones.
oh, okay.
oh no, no.
really make one.
I am not going for bulk, I am going for tone.
not.
what?
some... grass, weed?
I am not worried.
oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women?
i do not know why everyone does not do this.
let me in.
oh sure, and when you are ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right.
also, i have never missed a day due to illness.
i could not have agreed with you more.
i wrote down a list of bullet points why holly and i should be together, and I am going to find the perfect moment today and i am going to tell her.
ok, is there a, an operating theater that is open to visitors?
ah, i know, everything really.
i umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point.
buildings here in scranton are literally powered by coal.
no you are not.
and that is just the way it is.
no, no, no!
damn it.
because you have great ideas.
this is not one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
there is no more seats.
the trip sucked, david.
what?
the tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
a couple of years ago, i went to one in hartford.
she understood that we did not have to laugh to enjoy -- I am already starting to forget what color eyes she had.
second only to the neck.
no, this is not a joke.
you are mean.
this is the performance of your life!
it seems a little shady.
ok, game on, man.
well, i did it too.
what is the problem?
yes.
you think stanleys grow on trees?
did i ever tell you about the day that steve martin died?
i can not hire clark.
do not screw the pooch.
he thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
hey.
ha ha!
this is going to sound weird, but i think i may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole pam situation.
what is it, then?
i guess i have a face you can trust.
oh, yeah.
we will be called gryffindor.
questions?
yes.
it is not "farm boy swill," i will show you.
take care of anything you forgot to do.
the rye-guy.
which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what i just did for dwight.
so did you hear the news?
thirty-one!
i will not I am just saying we have something... ok. whatever.
okay.
this is my gym, my rules.
no!
it blew chunks.
I am sorry.
dwight, run!
hello?
oh, wow.
okay?
anything goes!
ring it.
okay, you know what?
you have to be honest, here.
did you hear pam is pregnant?
oh, thank you, erin.
I would like to give you $100 million.
banana fana fo fanley.
I am not going to call her.
and I will tell you why.
it is possible that i could be talking about us.
istn't it?
i want to do it today.
ok. good night ryan.
like, a hospital?
that laugh is so infectious.
hup!
no exceptions except michael.
oh!
i hate to do it this way but, you know, that is just... we are having a friendly game.
this is it.
what does that even mean?
they were.
day 45, company saved.
you need to be robin shyamalan.
it all adds up.
is there a place closer that sells them?
this is not about me, and that is debatable.
everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.
these are some things that i would like to have happen.
i would give that lecture a solid b+.
uh... ok, let us give it for miss... holly flaaaax!
following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going "please kitty, may i have some more?" you can not make this stuff up!
let us go.
talk to me face.
just, okay.
yes!
oh, okay.
coincidence - i am going to go for a little stroll myself.
ha!
look at that!
it is a setup.
and i am in!
thank you, esther.
do you want to hear a lie?
um, no, no, no.
what is this?
i also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what- heeded- when no one hedded- n-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
wow!
here we are.
what you mean uh hmmm... ?
oh and uh, molly... i know it can not be easy working for january good luck with your feelings.
it is not art.
n- well, to be fair, jim... james... jimothy... to be fair, jimothy, the- ah, that sounds weird.
deal with it!
you still getting it regular man?
and if it was an especially cold winter, and there were not enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood.
i hit a deer with my car.
fresh and new.
bye.
oscar is my friend -- ...and i just do not care who sees it, does not bother me!
are you nuts?
easy.
they did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so i am now going to fake fire him.
yes!
and that is why I am hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies.
oh, that guy?
angela kitchen.
ow!
did you have a good weekend going there?
but look at all the facts.
i have written down a list of illegal drugs.
suck it!
does she do it as my superior?
irrelevant question.
oh- she is not here?
yeah todd, decent idea.
300 going once.
but i think you should just know that i am going to be giving her a ride home later.
no, no.
hey, what are you listening to?
stop giggling.
got you!
that is like drinking a battery.
david?
deck hands is one.
hey, did you catch that up at lake wallenpaupack?
come on!
I am teaching him a lesson.
that one says, "i am so lame." know which one i want?
i... he is hot, all right?
he is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair.
the mind has to wrap around the foot.
no, no, no.
no, you can not get flowers for someone who is in a coma.
what is that supposed to be?
the air force?
james, pamela, and peepee halpert!
how did it go with stanley?
my belt's made out of alligator.
was it worth it?
we start on a single blank sheet of paper.
i thought about playing in the nhl, but, you are on the road so much.
those glasses are super dark.
oh okay.
we will use the doll.
I am thinking maybe a coup or we take ryan hostage.
that does not make any sense.
awww, help, help me!
it is a real bitch.
i was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor.
oh, my god!
i know.
come on in.
i recently purchased some insurance that i can not afford given my present salary.
"no shirt, no shoes, no problem." this is an attitude i would like all of you to have right here.
shhh... shut it!

todd packer, ladies and gentlemen!
that car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.
other than by using magic.
uh-uh.
for the insurance money!
i do not talk to my girlfriend about money.
why are the new people on the table?
we are never going to find those leads, are we?

yeah I am serious.
if you did not badger me with so many questions, pam, i could be done with it by now.
times have changed a little.

they do not warn you when the cameras are driving by.
we are both the victims of broken engagements.
no way.
pam is down for anything.
we do not know what they are going to say.

little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she is in the desert and the field is an oasis.
but you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and i just can not wait to see how you handle it.
we did it!
they have been sleeping together for some time.
cupids and hearts.
everyone.
sexual harassment.
roll him, roll him, roll him.
good worker, though.
my grandfather was told that diamond dancer would never race again.
is he as good a salesman as i?
everybody!
have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
mikanos and... okay.
pow!
breasts: not anything to write home about.
just hit me.
check it out.
let us get the party started.
one time, we were out and we met this set of twins.
oh, kelly!
or a woman.
you work on commission, do not you?
that is what took down the stalk inn.
it is kind of snooty.
i really need my job back.
hello  you are about five hours early to the party.
everybody, dunder-mifflin scranton employees, brenda, i have some very, very urgent news i need to tell everybody right now.
and i did too.
I am on it.
after you said you were not coming, i invited carol to come and i do not think that i did anything wrong.
well, suit yourself.
your tiny fingers make the best knots.
so, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the mcdreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he is in love with her... really?
we will talk about it later.
it is?
it is my aunt shirley, she is on her last legs.
oh.
I am in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton, pennsylvania but I am also the founder of diversity tomorrow, because today is almost over.
give that back.
jim is like big bird.
bros before hos.
it is the second easiest job in the world.
well, hi there david wallace.
hmm.
well, saddlesaEUR   aEUR  sometimes fall off, especially if you do not properly cinch the girth.
unless you and i decide we want to talk to jo, then we will give her a call.
see-through, push-up, lace?
I have already got my name picked out, lord rupert everton.
because that is how my mind works.
do not leave us, help us, we need help jim!
why do you even want to stay at dunder mifflin?
how may we help you?
my aunt shirley has died.
he was my accomplice.
does your husband have very soft erections?
i just went out for a walk.
i mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff.
um... that was not much of an introduction.
too slow.
lampshade on head!
i started by looking for a brownstone, like the huxtables had,  but instead i found this very, very, nice place in jamaica, queens, mon.
one of you will make a living, and nothing more.
that is the game.
well, he can not do what i can do.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... okay!
wowweee.
and then, just the bottom parts... we just need a pretense to talk to him.
that does not make any sense.
on our way to new york.
listen to me.
oh my god.
okay.
with this job, i can barely cover that.
oh my god.
kathy!?
final one, final one this is important.
everyone is going to end up dying someday.
oh, my god.
that was a woman i was talking to, so... she had a very low voice.
ha-ha!
other cousin mose.
case study: me.
i never said you could do that.
"count choculitis" why did you write that down jim?
get out.
kevin!
what is wrong with you?
we have, in front of you here, seven different types of pennsylvania top soil.
i di- alright, I will take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world i would want to do is upset pam.
oh my god, she told you?
a person did this.
because, i thought we had the same birthday.
because that is... wow, i am so happy.
i do not think our company actually needs any more insurance.
no, really.
nellie's right.
believe it.
you have the right to remain silent.
you know why?
okay.
and bavon takes people parasailing.
that is possible.
my boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel.
yes, sir.
and she took a bite, started to choke.
i do not know what I am grabbing here.
that is not why you lost.
really?
our hero!
that was packer!
and when i have curried favor with her, i will let you know.
yes, thank you for seeing that.
our theme, if you will.
no.
you have no idea.
january i think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
who is the father?
yes.
and I am closing the door.
am i worried about that?
first up, proficiency in necessary skills.
heh, okay, weirdo.
and then i will hike mount doom.
actually this is good.
first impressions get locked in forever.
hooters is a restaurant.
really?
dwight!
ohaEUR there you go.
yeah, i applied for a job there.
maybe you should.
and this is everybody's favorite day.
which I am happy to do.
ryan, my man!
yes, and you are my favorite client.
stop it!
jo collects them.
me.
that was not scripted.
it is not up to me?
makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing.
people, human lives, however, can... okay, let us go.
i quit my job.
it is an amish technique.
memories.
what?
i want the teapot.
yeah, I am busy right now.
nice.
i want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.
what?
oh.
ehhhh, well.
are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice?
who knows how to throw an outfit together.
ah, fell asleep, took a nap.
oh, hey, everybody, i think that jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
we got to find it before it eggs.
angela can stay the same, but we will change andy to dwight.
you guys know me.
this is not a cheap motel!
so... what are you doing?
warf.
hi, i am michael scott, i am the captain of this party.
it is not ready yet.
over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!
i accidentally ran over it.
your nurse became your girlfriend?
no.
too much formaldehyde!
300 and one penny, 300 and one penny.
wait, what are you again?
just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to pam and jim, then so be it.
oh, stumbling, i need something to grab on to!
oh wow another living room!
it dies.
shrute!
oink oink oink oink.
good economic sense.
I am trying, but what you are asking is- okay.
why?
okay.
you are back.
this is egregious!
you know who you would love?
we are not going to die of radon, we are going to die of boredom.
well, well, have we been blessed today.
the what now?
part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
hello little boy, what is your name?
i am going to go get laid.
you told me there was a rule.
now to your right.
show of hands.
we have a laminating machine.
we have not even gotten bread yet.
oh... oh no, not the huggy monster!
no.
we need some tunes, i think.
nope, nope, i do not think anybody wants to see that.
very funny, michael!
i imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo.
we need to just get one picture where we are all in the air at the same time.
yes, under my tutelage.
i can name pixar movies, too.
you are the future!
I will tell you what phyllis did wrong.
gah!
we are complete strangers.
oh, I am really worried that I am going to say it.
you can be martha stewart's receptionist!
phyllis is santa?
fake tree.
and... i have a great one .
just sit down!
now I have got a beard, and i can do whatever i want, and I am your boss.
and i can just go buy another telescope.
i say, i say, i say, i say down holly!
here we go.
what bothers you as guys, you know?
nothing left to do except dot the i's, the j's, and the umlauts.
probably will not.
you down with the dundies?
yes we will see oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities!
the sex is not nearly as good as it used to be.
hey.
no.
if she was sitting across from you on a train and she was not moving, you might think she was dead.
so ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond.
are you kidding me?
i need to take.
nice.
and i want it someday, but just in the future.
here is the door.
operation surprise.
oh, yeah!
if oscar wants a donkey, let us get him one.
you me?
yeah, randy newman's the best.
to our boss!
ryan's about to attend the michael scott school of business.
in front of me.
hey, you know what?
i happen to like the hilarious hijinx i get myself into.
i am the regional manager of dunder mifflin paper products.
yes, kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a bynes or a hope.
these are my associates.
luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup.
wuh, how, how old are you?
i was the youngest pilot in pan am history.
unless you like it.
like tide.
i am blowing dodge.
michael.
really?
see you.
can i do some of the talking?
fun on wheels.
seventeen.
jo, may i speak to you for a second?
what are you going to do?
michael!
I am loving it.
god!
that, that, then why would, why would i not like that?
ladies and gentlemen!
good job.
so what do i do?
dumatril!
five, four, three.
ok. you know what?
yes!
and i am happy to say that you have passed.
and beets are not immune.
i trapped him last night and I am giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one i destroyed.
it is a terrible idea.
yes... get back, get back.
we need to do stuff together outside of work.
I have got it leveraged.
no.
right in your face!
those are the ad guys right there.
make sure this party gets rolling and i will be back shortly.
oh-ho!
karen, do you need to go pump?

toby, come on over.
this is do or die.
the electric city.
okay?
where did you read that?
move it or lose it!
and then work our way up to death drop.
scranton.
ha ha ha!
hello, traitor.
i just got off the phone with the mill.
i ball the entire time.
and they are dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they are singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
do not let him.
no, no, no.
and the "tight ass" award goes to angela.
i know.
just tell me quietly.
it does not matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea.
convicted rapist.
they have to.
no.
the pressure!
we are going to go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we are going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, i would like you to forget everything that toby has said, okay?
you already there?
i can give you more money-there is your better life.
ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
it is on the list, everybody.
ok, yes that would be bad.
so do i sign?
this strappy young lad sitting here is phyllis' father, albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, are not you albert, hah?
get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every monday for the next seven mondays.
ah.
if you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
this place... is like... the hospital where i was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
ok, alright i got to go.
"the dundies, how can i explain it?
you will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
we are all going to have a good time tonight!
per diem.
okay, you know what.
i celebrate these women.
that is two things.
then we do not have to hide anymore.
i am the landlord.
name a knot, any knot.
english peoples' main use today is judging american talent.
who wants some munchies?
they deserve the right to dress as they please.
look at all those staplers!
what, are you talking about me and holly?
i am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
you know, i used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and i never caught anything that big.
believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
but i think... you should do it.
and I am telling 'ya, could be in maxim.
got a little client meeting at shanny of'gannigan's tonight.
hmm?
i just have had a bad day.
my main concern, should i have a safe word?
so joke's on you.
toby flenderson, come on up here.
I am sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude.
hey toby!
i just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head.
once again, it is show time.
well, we are running a business, so.
get lost.
yeeesh.
did you pass out in there?
with ferocity!
so maybe i do understand.
'the village', 'unbreakable', 'sixth sense', 'sig... ' okay.
dwight, you got to move!
I have got a couple of shirts that do not fit so well anymore.
I am... discombobulated.
oh pam.
but you know what makes people forget their differences?
oh.
we just told you he was not mafia, so you would not be scared.
food service.
um... and i want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead.
ok?
or obama twins?
whew, oh god.
ok, do not get that.
you know, david.
michael, i... i can handle that.
hello, i would like to apply for a job.
and yeah, jim this is the time to stop putting dwight's personal effects into jell-of.
it will be fun.
a world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life.
look at that.
it is disgusting.
hmm, well that is interesting darryl.
not bad, huh?
ok. I am sorry.
you go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.
actually, I am a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano.
it is my job to be there for michael.
no, no, no, no... ...no, no, no, no, it is not what you think.
hey.
yes, yes, yes, hi-yes!
see you in a bit.
that is what I have heard.
bureaucracy and germs.
i want that in the passengers cupholder.
let us do it!
all right.
i am a sheriff's deputy.

uhhhh....no one.
hey shut up.

i am a victim of a hate crime.
no i was just check- yeah.
you know what?
little kid lover.
dave barry?
i will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
my treat.

say it.
actually-- no, bulgaria.
although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
tap deangelo out.
you would hate it.
you said you did not have plans.
yes, i will.
january.. you thought i had no more cards left to play.
good, do you see what I am saying?
well that goes without saying.
they are so arrogant.
you know, not what this is about.
yes.
what is going on?
until you get down to the single cell shark.
something to win their affections back.
oh, so that is what they are saying?
everybody in here.
kevin!
and make one tiny mistake, you are dead.
michael has been talking to my biggest client.
it is about you.
you know, i feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
I am a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
thank you so much for calling me!
that is not how business works, okay?
but do not you call it that, I have earned the right.

i want to have a child for business reasons and i want you to be the mother.
"scranton mimeograph corp?" i do not think we are doing business with them any time soon.
hmm, does not seem like the type.
thank you.
it hit the rim.
do not.
and i want you to say something different.
this is christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
shout it out.
four years in a row.
thank you.
clark has no chance.
exit points people.
you cannot go wrong with a throat punch no, there is a defense for that.
no, no!
and i could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.
I am glad you feel better.
they are not going to gotch me.
so, without further ado, let us start clapping!
you will say 'yes' on one.
look what he is doing.
What are you got?
just a little something i whipped up.
not so.
we should call him rye bread.
big deal.
you see, it is on my periphery and if i needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow.
someday, temp.

ok. oh, god, no.
pam.
pam, i have a mission to accomplish.

this is dwight schrute.
leader... ship.
stanley, you do not need to answer that.
let us get back to the matter at hand.
alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
so you would think that is a good idea for me to do?
there are a lot of different ways to get revenge.
who would you do, roy?
hi.
they are our neighbors to the south, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of north america.
oh, me too.
big problems... do not ever change billy.
so have you felt the vibe yet?
say your prayers.
get in the back.
okay, dwight, you can let go of her hand.
toby flenderson to the principal's office.
no, but seriously, your ears are the key.
angry.
guess I am a sucker for historical fiction.
yeah?
ok. so what is the secret michael?
you know, i want to go and, and find out something about myself, i want to get outta here.
anybody?
because i am not pleased.
why?
decisiveness.
so I will know where-- I am asking pam to do it, please.
here we go.
you are welcome.
I am just having a little exit interview.
no, you are not.
watch it, watch it.
bastard!
why do magnets stick together?
unicorn walks into the office, "oh, do you have an appointment?"  okay, look pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you are doing wrong.
press the pound key!
my idea.
steak.
uhh, i do not know.
where...  "from the desk of andrew bernard."  a note.
i looked straight at the bag.
and now, a very special treat... a book my grandmutter used to read me when i was a kid.
nope!
can everyone please shut up, please!
yeah.
really?
let us go do it to somebody else.
you want to talk now, good; ok, dwight, leave.
do it again.
i want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me.
it is all toby's fault.
</i> i got problems billy.
great.
packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
pam, could i have a word with you in my office?
safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and...  getting everyone home on time.
come on!
i think it is crazy the coach will not play him frankly.
do not mess with colorado.
yes, but, ben franklin was.
I am going to of have some of this meat sandwich.
oh ho, the look on your faces!
this is wrong!
i am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
why is he talking to holly?
we have not even started this horrible process of... okay, creed.
aw, man, that is insulting.
hey, halpert, what is the big idea?
i like her.
oh, my god!
please?
I am sorry.
huh!
yes, i am, absolutely.
we will start small.
all right?
ah damn pop-ups.
okay, you are going to make me say it.
gladly!
wait a second.
sorry, we are all booked up.
you got burned, because packer's back!
yeah.
well, i was born to be belsnickel.
you go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
i know you are going to like this.
we do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment.
i was under the impression that billy would be more like that guy.
is everything satisfactory with your stay?
fail!
what the hell is going on?
you guys got to be kidding.
no.
michael scott, dunder-mifflin paper company.
mmmmmm, let us call it secret assistant <i>to</i> the regional manager.
settling... and settled.
you are a funny guy pam.
we already have packer on the road.
nothing.
it is very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can... son of a bitch.
she would talk to anybody.
nice dress, ryan.
here we go.
you think the epa would ever allow that much deet?
oh, yeah.
alright?
it is all connected.
you can.
ok, i take it back, it is a workspace.
do i know what the surprise is?
how do you... how do you get people interested in depression?
wow.
i mean, i could try destroying the pumpkin... jim, no.
and then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
what?
we are like one of those classic famous teams.
leaving pennsylvania.
all the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
and that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black.
eghh, she is crazy.
ok. you are welcome.
idiot.
pam.
i will now perform my final kata forms.
of course.
how are you doing, man?
we can not do this to those people.
to me, pain is not pain at all.
pam, just be professional.
because he would be intimidated and i, just... let us start again.
this is where the magic happens.
nice to see you.
i know what we are going to do.
go!
good.
the smoke could be coming through an air duct.
no.
so, uh, probably the question.
i like starting each day with a sense of possibility.
mmm-- mmm...  um... close the door.
woman.
jan, listen, i promise that i will kick it up a notch.
what is iiiit?
i want you to help us work on some banter.
huh?
so i traded the telescope for it.
we are warriors!
alright, let us get back to work.
is it a good plan?
shut up maggot!
very well.
and, and we pay  them but we make  them feel like they did something really wrong.
go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
whoever is taking it is not only insane...  they are now off their meds.
getting a little something that calm the nerves?
sounds great.
well, then, they need our money more than ever.
basement office?
congratulations.
eeeh!
and laughter... also.
i do not have to buy it.
what is the office actually goes under?
meet me in our spot in four minutes.
the point is you just have to play with the cards that you are dealt.
we are reaaallly mooovin' now!
meryl streep is the bad guy.
these people do not realize how lucky they are.
i have herpes.
that is genius.
from now on, if you are hot, sit on an ice pack.
possibly filipino.
oh, i am in my office.
you should ask her out.
thank you.
blah.
yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, did not you?
hawkman.
it is my brain-grandchild.
he is got the broad face of a brewer.
it is over.
pam, messages please?
why do not you look over some of our materials?
you okay?
i need you to see this.
do not drink all of it.
let us move!
alright.
yeah, you should see her naked.
it is a punishment.
i do not know.
because that guy could not get sick, just like me.
I have been raising children since i was a baby.
i would not say that...it is a bit much.
you should have called me from downstairs.
but i think it was worth it.
i like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world.
I am like forrest gump, except i am not an idiot.
mose or the real mose?
whoo!
who is on him?
i got it here.
lot of fire where you are going.
there is no name listed.
my little heart can barely take it no more.
any message you want me to relate to jim?
sorry your party's so lame.
yeah!
take that, saddam!
even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity.
well, i can not afford it, and corporate will not pay for it.
thank you.
so we will have an onion loaf for the table, please.
that is... that is, sorry, that is terrible.
i am not a hero.
wait.
bye.
you know what that is?
how is this place treating you?
all right.
i am on top of it.
good.
i have cable and satellite as a backup.
i hate you!
what makes her beautiful?
ooh.
i, uh, hmm.
good!
i just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen.
you guys could double date.
when i was in the sandbox as a kid, i got not respect.
man, what is taking toby so long?
wait, wait, wait, come, i just, i just want to know why?
it was pretty awesome.
another time, packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute.
look at that one.
i, uh, I am done.
I will take a shirt.
this cleaver appears to need sharpening.
ummm... hm... no.
please michael, please.
she used to work for hr?
dwight will be driving me deep into the pennsylvania wilderness.
yeah, i will.
catch you guys-  catch you guys on the filippity flip.
no wonder women despise you.
mm-do... dwight would not- i. understand.
oh, god.
am i nomadic?
in keeping with schrute custom, i will either invite you to saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face.
i found twins.
okay?
here... who is here?
look, if i was gay, i would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.
uh, no, they did not say team.
and dwight.
how that horse became a doctor, i do not know.
come on.
jan?
hey, oscar!
kudos to ryan, king of the party committee.
no, no, no.

good night.
i need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
small businessman magazine.
i can not see myself.
meh.
i have a cold sore.
hold that thought.
all work and no play makes michael a dull boy.
one day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
you can not tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
i know.
at night.
no, no, no.
i thought this is where you liked your privacy.
how about 911?
thanks for coming in, that is always... always helpful when i give him a call.
jazz is stupid.
i do not care, they are your oats.
there not going to downsize because i miss a lot of deadlines.
got the food?
this situation all up in here is what is messed up!
i guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you do not.
let us go.
what lab did these little clones escape from?
so.
will never be her name.
what?
you are so colorful.
here we go.
there is got to be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... oh, no.
i think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
why do not you, ah, show them some of your bling.
just, you know we  bumped into each and you said, "brr, brr." and i went, "argh, argh." you know?
she was a prostitute.
here is how we find out.
exactly.
it is something that i... wanted to do... and so it is voluntary, really.
i have yet another sales order for you to sign.
sit.
okay, yeah, i know what to do.
oh man!
three days ago, i slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments.
no.
i call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
whoa, look at those vivid colors.

do not swallow it.
one of us is out of here by the end of today!
busted.
wait!
for reha- what did you do?
well, well, well, it is finally happened.
I am in.
okay.
all right!
that is how you really apply the pressure.
ok you know what, you can be a witness.
my grandpa was the funnest guy i ever knew.
oh man!
pro for ryan, he went to business school, he is my number one choice.
and that she was better than all the other hos in the world.
you know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats catholics.
hey guys.
because today, is the day that jim and pam become one.
do you want to get some breakfast or something?
yes, i have an office.
what about line varieties?
when phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute.
tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.
once I am officially regional manager my first order of business will be to demote jim halpert.
very excited?
okay, just summarize.
no.
none of your business.
that is the life.
nope, wrong room.
oh yes!
all i want to be is santa.
come on.
no.
50 cents, yeah.
they use props.
so, I am going to... you are not as much fun as your jamaican brothers... mon.
okay.
alright, good.
where are all the animals?
no, I am not.
that could be a little confusing, because in sales a-b-c means "always be closing." shut it.
right?
hey, what are you laughing at?
ok, what else?
well, deal with this.
I am michael scott.
mmhm, i hear you.
i do not even know, first-name basis!
see?
he could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil.
i would like a 15% raise.
i put stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.
well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.
until the day you came to replace him.
leave it here.
and smart.
it is a defective ax, my friend.
i can just continue to run it myself.
stanley, do not walk out that door!
yes, it is true.
how would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
great.
yes.
no, no!
had  them all my life.
that was good!
anything you guys want.
what?
angela kevin, you have to help me out i just need a few things then i will be gone.
what is this?
new attitudes about handicap people.
now they are protecting america's real treasure, paper.
what are you doing for lunch?
karaoke, i love it!
oh, right.
did you hear about angela?
pukey's good.
keep an existing... yeah, but look, i mean, he did not need business school.
he sometimes wears glasses, write that down.
so once again no growth.
ok, we... all right.
my top salesman, jim halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator pamela beesley halpert is my best friend.
a place where unattractive and attractive people can get together.
so back to work.
yeah?
well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, january mm hm.
exactly.
have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the mormon church?
okay.
wow!
i need a username.
i would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
jim?
can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
good.
all right.
tock- let us get jim!
hut!
oh god!
a man who has ruined all other men for you.
i get it.
i define it as dwight schrute.
you know what?
you are a good worker, and a good man.
please.
that is ridiculous.
the liar will avoid direct eye contact.
dwight was kidding and i do not know why because it was not funny... and it was just horrible.
mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
but i do know this.
mmmmmm.
i also enjoy online banking.
i love pain.
go inside and shop, until i can meet you.
if my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
that is a foul.
michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
I will bring them by.
yeah, they work.
toby!
that is where i stashed the chandelier.
vomicillin.
two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
and now he hates me.
are.
but what?
and i just want my nephew to work in my pool.
you got to milk them, or else they will moo like crazy.
hmmm, interesting.
damn it!
okay?
michael scarn does not make deals.
do black people like pizza?
wow.
oh my god.
well, let us see.
yes?
a customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.
meredith?
and i looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads.
I would tell you, but then I would have to kill you.
next suggestion: "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression".
dwight, what is the traffic like?
okay, i will... I am not feeling very well right now though.
another day.
can i call you back?
dwight schrute, scranton branch.
get set!
picture someone doing something heroic.
it is spppplllibbb no, here is the thing.
china should be like eight.
hello.
sure.
it happens.
let us see if i can help.
okay, oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education.
oh, god, there are so many.
now how do i get her back?
spit that out.
i just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for angela and i. do not worry though, i have taken down their names, and i have docked them a personal day.
i have risked a great deal to tell you this information.
all the time i was thinking, "I am sleeping with your wife." and you know who does that?
i do not have the relationship with these people that i thought i did.
i went medieval on his heinie.
like an improv conversation.
those are the real heroes.
I am sorry.
your turn, you have to go.
open your mouth.
all right.
i do not believe in apologies.
um, what, ah, what is, i mean... ...come on, jan!
a year?
oh, ouch.
floor manager debbie brown has officially been terminated.
not the way i taught you!
ah, so when did you set up shop?
ssshh stupid!
do not.
come on in.
it is over.
all right.
hey howard.
glee?
... please do not send dwight!
alright let us just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
today i ended up seeing a lot of women that i used to date, and in my mind they were all great.
sounds... fun.
what kind of toppings would you like?
I am going to leave it up.
thank you.
you are like a hundred.
yeah, great!
i color code all my info.
i have like a thousand people over every week to watch it.
move, move, move, move!
and uh, i just want to assure you, that i mean no disrespect.
no, you-no.
you do not get to do your farming.
i was probably going to break up with her anyway.
but it is not for worms or eczema like any normal pill.
fa la la la la la la la la.
yeah.
no, i have never once experienced anything remotely like that.
come on!
we form an allegiance- -to use sudden violence.
an unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
i just um, i just want to let you know that i am going to go to your lamaze class tomorrow.
i just want to go in and fix it.
it was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
everybody!
just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
yeah.
it is a cemetery.
so you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?
no life, no family.
just do it, okay.
but it is going to cost you three more bucks.
rare.
it is time to go it is time to go.
nothing to be alarmed about.
you do not deserve to have this branch.
do not worry, she is dead.
it has been such a pleasure.
i do not know... yet.
some of these kernels have crowned.
i need more time.
I am just saying, why does god get to do something that i do not?
michael scott.
i am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.
wow!
me, me, me, me, me, me.
your pranks have never worked in the past and they are not going to work today.
why are you wearing a turtleneck?
no costume?
carol.
do not look at your card.
look.
saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony.
jim, what you do not understand is that this company's worthl- no- we do not have- uh... yes.
my girls.
before you put the new clothes on, angela's going to get you cleaned up a little bit.
you are not.
okay, okay.
uh... you know what?
you are not prying this out of my hands, but do not tempt me because I will give it to you!
when did everyone get so cynical?
you know what?
summer.
well, this is not about work.
really?
the day he grows hair.
i am better than this!
oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars because they failed to report a mold problem.
to not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
I am hitler.
so, that is where i will be.
oh, man.
this way, this way!
is it, is it because you are afraid of where this is going to take me?
get out of here.
she practically told me so.
yeah!
just get the car ready.
the gun is a beaumont-adams.
we do not do anything until michael gives us further instructions.
just stop it.
when will it end?
do i uh, do i get to pick the prize?
ryan.
i am deducting sixty points from voldemort for false pretenses.
ok.  that is not appropriate.
i have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
i should have known.
um, good.
because i would kick his ass.
what... all right!
we, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of boy scouts.
they are men, dwight.
thank you very much.
i could fire you.
going to be very delicious.
i find that unlikely.
do not sympathize.
i have already picked my team: darryl, oscar, angela, phyllis and toby and that is the team that i am taking.
all right, I will take them.
those eyes, look at her eyes.
no.
osprey?
these sleeves are cutting off my circulation.
that would never happen.
toby is the worst human being I have ever known.
nice.
we were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
where did you get those?
i love it!
did you do her?
i going to do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
look, kevin, do you really think that you could have dated erin?
unlikely.
he is fine.
i think we are a classic couple.
i, um... i-ah!
right on that black platform.
oh, just having to much fun.
so, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.
money is not real ever since we got off the gold standard.
umm hmm.
it will take a swat team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that." that is how devoted i am to this job.
i think you are great.
bye.
you were lying.
good.
so good.
hey.
alright?
hellboy's a hero.
you know what?
scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers.
i think i know how to ride a bike.
what do you guys think?
dwight and i are going to the big thing.
over my dead body, no.
did you have time to think about my offer?
see.
but not very many people know that.
hey.
get the hell out of here, idiot.
tell him.
it is time for grapes.
alright?
you know what?
osama bin laden.
because today we are all kings.
lobster?" this is what is at stake.
... you can pick that up, if you want.
that was-- that was a-- that was a really good choice.
well, jim, i just want to say that we have not always got along and at times, I have even hated your guts.
good.
oh, no, do not.
does not seem so macho now, does it?
mike's cereal shack.
guys, guys.
now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap.
uh, yes you are.
they are total failures.
come on!
oh my god.
keep working.
just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me.
do not know, do not care.
or does somebody miss me?
okay.
fine.
he is, he is like a really mean-spirited guy.
how many of you know the meaning of the jamaican term, hakuna matata?
i just, i do not see the connection between a firewalk and management.
do you have any of the very berry or ocean splash or- oh... okay.
horrible.
let us get back together.
michael.
you are going to be okay, monkey.
oh my god.
let me float something out there, okay?
which memo?
no.
very nice.
the loving union between people.
i did not do it.
ohhhkay.
i knew it.
... probably the funny way.
my weekend was bad so far.
ha ha, you are!
huh?
well, you know what?
you are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to angela that made her feel uncomfortable.
ugh, not you.
excuse me, hello.
uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
do not bother luke.
first, go to wendy's, get my food.
not good enough.
and you know what?
inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn.
and I am a little bit emotional right now because i know that i absolutely made the right decision.
turns out, creed was in the band "the grass roots" in the 1960's.
so, maybe you should come back.
you know what, we are going to tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
eventually, they will rise up and revolt.
i guess that is why i thought he ran away in the first place.
I am going to write you both up for not working.
i think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.
i mean, i slave all day and nobody notices me." next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house.
see you guys tomorrow.
brr-rrrp.
honey!
continue.
is that on the water?
just forget it.
i could have gotten that, idiot!
but check that it is covered by your health care provider!
what?
because I am not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba- i have a very difficult decision to make.
you want to do something for my own good?
remember?
it is not that children make me uncomfortable, it is just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle?
ok, come on, let us get our shower on.
charger?
I am not going to lie.
i just did.
did i say that?
come here, come here, come here!
got it?
what is that thing that dwight always says?
eughh.
but, um... yeah.
you guys are going so slow... come on, I am going backwards.
some people do not care about jim's new sports job in phila-whatever.
too fat.
and guess what, kids.
phyllis, think fast.
it is my idea.
all righty then, well i see you are going for the whole bored supermodel thing.
let me just start.
it is dwight k. schrute...  manager.
of course.
aah!
you are not going.
ok, give that back to me.
i could not sleep last night.
no.
give me a hand.
no, no you are wrong about this.
it is really the greatest day of all time.
hey, did you come up with toilet buddy?
cocks in the henhouse.
okay, stanley?
you sold us all on andy, a product that nobody wanted.
I am on official business.
hug it out, bitch.
not... significant is a big word... i think you are only a teeny... jim.
wrong.
perp grabbed the victim.
she would have definitely slept with me.
come here doggy, come on.
and i intend on winning that fight.
you will not regret this, michael.
stand up.
I am king of the world!
fine!
do not wish them luck.
google.
put your fingers here.
i am hurt.
well, because i want to know who wrote those diseases down.
dwight?
get outa here, please.
yes?
if tomorrow my company goes under, i will just start another paper company.
lurk much?
no.
ohhhhhh!
it could be my race, could be the fact that I am so fit, or I am a womanizer... fair game.
no thanks I am stuffed.
when michael was in charge, this place was like the roman empire.
city so nice they named it twice.
so you want to sell me magic beans.
hey, congrats on the bonus.
salesmen are the worst!
jim.
i know, i know you are angry.
nice outfit.
all right, I am sorry.
today I am prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
thank you.
sorry I am late, i had to race across town.
but i learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or ryan would ever teach me.
yeah, it is just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
i should be getting this client, michael.
that is my salad.
you have been on the road a long time.
i was not talking to you, pale-face.
excuse me, excuse me.
sorry, mr. buttlicker.
now, no one was there in the wine cellar.
that rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way.
uh huh.
sign it now!
it is really beating down on me now.
no touchy.
why do not you just get rid of this guy?
meredith is fired.
yes?
give it to me.
our point.
oh, i know your hero.
we broke up on the drive.
we are going on a harbor cruise of lake wallenpaupack.
we want the same things.
she is the love of my life.
because I am here for one thing.
i do not know.
hi, mr. bart.
frankly, you have a job because ryan and pam are starting with us as salesmen.
uhm... that is insane!
one must wrestle fear to the ground.
now what you are feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... you are thinking, "am i good enough for this job?
they are for my cousin mose.
holiday inn?
watch this.
i would like to talk to you all about life preservers.
yeah, she does all that.
oh, very thoughtful.
so, phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now i am recruiting you.
alright!
why?
wait, imodium or ex-lax?
yes!
you know what?
question.
do not tell anyone.
thank you.
relax.
good.
i mean, who saw the movie titanic?
yeah, that is true.
who wrote this, hysterical one?
ryan, cut!
I am going to miss you.
what do we do, people?
so.
good.
no, where did you get that?
and do not worry about the cost, sabre is footing the bill.
no.
nine dollars.
okay.
and it is style 3. and it is not ideal.
yeah that sounds good.
you are going to break it.
oh, i could beat up dwight.
oh, yeah.
take it back.
who is going to tell on us?
and i wanted to see what i could do to nudge you in the right direction.
it was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times.
hit it, dwight!
there she is.
and i just wanted to call you all here, together, because i have something important.
um... well, you guys, you know, I am the boss so... hey, hey... you guys believed me?
come here!
i had congress with angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins.
up here.
in addition to severance, and everything, i want to give you this gift certificate to chili's.
hm.
thank you.
i do not think she is going to make it.
okay, okay, what is better?
stop it right-stop it right now.
I am just reading it out loud.
can you stop this?
good.
when he leave here, which way did he go?
did you know, that china has a new missile, that can sink a us naval carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
let us do this.
there is no telling what i might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
the chimney is in decent shape.
do not put my jacket.
and whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office.
a great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.
smart broad.
kung-fu movies!
you are a traitor.
she sits there all day.
thank you for coming in.
jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.
and now we are going to honor it.
I am a shoo-in.
I am somewhere between a snake and a mongoose.
not michael, e.t.
the company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
i called six minutes ago and no one answered.
oh shoot!
I am sorry.
everywhere a woof, woof.
let me show you to your area, sir.
that is not going to happen.
mush!
can not you understand that?
nice side note: they might think "hey, i should have been nicer to michael."  but that is... not why I am doing this... then, i land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.
attention please!
find out whose car that is.
I am not familiar with the word.
and i have said goodbye to half of them.
let us go.
my job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper.
that is the american dream right there, right?
i want that vice-presidency.
must be thinking about retirement.
allow me.
i can not even say it.
i was thinking about our little leak problem.
he is just being stupid.
simple.
it is.
one of the new people, please?
come on.
why did not you stay?
therefore i know the killer to be phyllis, aka beatrix bourbon, the person i most medium suspect.

oh, by the way.
dwight just got howard family dry cleaners.
I will call him.
you and your wife, and you have kids.
oh, this is your cell, i thought this was your... michael.
excuse me!
okay, kevin.
do you live in a regular sized house?
i do not have eggs.
dwight, what is your middle name.
mm, nope.
i mean, what... was it toby?
is it stanley?
answer over to the question.
plus i just... i think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
you know?
who is next?
this has been a wonderful day.
what if she makes me?
pam, michael scott.
hey!
no, what I am saying is... no, that is not it.
what is a pallet?
that sucks!
wow.
no!

I have never been a fan.
i apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.

i think she is gorgeous.
I am interviewing for a job at corporate.
okay, knock it off, rolph.
no, he should not.
300 and one penny.

robert dunder everybody.
ok. it did.
ha!!!
tony!
I am thinking about having my sperm frozen.
haahh!!
it is done!
i hate, hate, hate being left out.
a little bit of paaam, all night long, a little bit of angela on the thing... ...a little bit of phyllis everywhere... ...a little bit of roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of jim with some ribs, a little bit of... will her highness, jan levinson-gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at dunder mifflin scranton?
hey, pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today?
check.
you are right, i did not even think of him.
oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.
redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
just a sec.
and, god...  that is my phone.
kelly, ryan looks great.
you know what?

i know.
um... so are you in down this weekend?
shut up.
kind of a ying-yang.

here we go, sixty-five.
get in here... everybody.
oscar!
oh, this does not look good.
david's gone.
when i jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately.

everyone would go to one santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she would ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." at which point the kgb would arrest you and send you to siberia.

no sales topic per se.
hey ryan, look.

i have a copy of your key.
we should head out.

pam was supposed to get  them.
oh, your little feelings party did not work out?
mmm.
what are you doing in there?
it is as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
take one, pass it down.
you... oh, no it is not.
did you ever experiment with other women?
you having a wardrobe malfunction there?
no, no!

think it through.
she is- okay.
sorry.
excellent idea, pam.
can we have the room please?
no, no, no.
you understand?
probably did not want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.
dwight, vp.
you are absolutely right.
this is craps.

and it is very exciting.
you served the office with great dignity.
good stuff.
where is he?
no, no, no, no, no, it is not me.

uh... I have got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
he threw  them on the ground!
okay!
i just... i miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it.
jim, we are getting crapped on.
which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis.
never.
it is still wet.
okay, okay.
you know what, we do not have to deal with this.

he is crazy.
how did you know?
not really so much.
but, i want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money.
no, it was mutual.
i was paraphrasing.
and i just do not think corporate is going to go for this right now.
the states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest.
i am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a senator.
michael!

those girls really wailed on you bad.
i think not!
hi, mema.

i miss the old dunder mifflin.
personal hero, cool new guy.
if you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
you know what?
that is what she said.
why do not you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them.
so i love willy wonka.
there is this resort called sandals.
stanley, as you know, is retiring.

when i was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... i got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and i had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and i never came outside.
put the-- put the manure down!
got to bring our... a game.
do my time.
michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
nobody knows what their race is, so... i want you to really go for it, because this is real.
anyway, i was giving it some thought, and there is no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can not, you know, just... sit down and work this whole meredith thing out.
ok, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
do not need it.
i insist.
this is a business question.
no big deal.

you are going to sit in the back left  where i do not have to see your ugly moongob.

although i love this company more than almost anything in the world, i have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family.
this is not kelly kapoor story hour.
i suppose i could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
he does not daylight as your plumber.
well, I will be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.
pretty cool, huh?
oh really?
it is just stress.
you know what?
listen, you are a perfectly fine toilet.
oh, you are kidding me.
yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
and i mean that figuratively.
there is a point there.
it is ok guys, she is no longer horny.
you know, gabe?
get a friend, loser.
and then another- oh, i do?!
oh, well, I am glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I am down here it does not seem too busy to me.
ok, everybody have their towels and swim suits?
you cannot sell while undergoing fear.
no.
what is it?
i will do my voodoo.
I am unhappy when I am with her.
it is moving day.
and i call over to kevin, "kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" and he looks at me and he says, "michael, yes it is a tweed jacket." and i look back at him and i say, "i feel the need!... the need for tweed." oh, thank you.
come here.
check it out.
hoo-ooh!
how many is that per hour?
did you get lucky?
no way!
okay.
yeah.
yeah, more like a 1,000. i just think that hero?
yeah, i know, i know.
a prank, huh?
if the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
it, we both, i did not want it, we both did not want it to continue.
i do not want to waste your time, and i would not dare waste mine.
tell me where it hurts.
are you being the best that you can be?
angela loves pussy cats, and packer loves- i was going to say dogs!
try my googi, googi.
I am going to do it.
you want to take a look?
somebody help her.
life is short.
this is the same photo, matrix style.
it is one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
that is my christmas card.
dr. david friendly, he came up with this thing.
should not be doing this today.
it is me, dwight!
i will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
oh, man!
uh, jan, what happened?
america.
where are you taking the client list?
or else what?
i believe his tissue has made me stronger.
oh, yes, i did.
friends fight.
so i guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have?
no, no no no no.
look at that!
and i want you to burn this into your brains.
no, like you.
now i need a noun.
yes.
e-quality.
okay, yeah, why do not you go get it?
mm-hmm.
he got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from.
ugh... all right.
when darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
ohh!
why do not you explain this to me like I am five.
code name re/max is here.
why do not they just want you to go by yourself?
ahh.
and this is my dinner on your face.
guh-oood.
good to see you!
maybe i  called him, i do not know.
I am pretty sure she is baked on a professional level.
could oscar and angela be having a gay affair?
oh, i hate monkeys.
we have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
it was nice to see devon again.
glee right?
use that as an inspiration.
jack nicholas.
and women have sex before marriage and i think we need to celebrate that.
one more hour.
I am sorry.
you know who used to sit at that desk?
no.
i need something fun.
let me out!
okay, i know what is going on.
so they may be looking for a little change in the cfo.
it is after 5:00, jim.
I am going to stall them for a little bit.
a p40 is much higher pitched.
come here.
it is a ram.
and we are going to sell that to charity.
disappear.
yeah.
i have to run to my car to take a dump.
I am excited by that.
the shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: perfectinschlag.
okay.
hey toby.
sh-new york and the whole art school thing.
it will be fun.
hold on.
i just do not agree.
the winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
i will not.
alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner.
parley, my office, five minutes.
no!
there is nothing she can do to stop it now.
hello sir.
i can not see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
oh god!
this is the moment when scranton and stamford come together as one.
look.
i mean, we know we are going to start dating.
but that was then.
you are good with receptionists.
so have a great long weekend.
that is johnny depp.
so, am i a hunter gather culture?
dunder mifflin.
there is nothing i can do about my wide-set eyes.
but you know what, you have been engaged for three years and i know you have set a date.
hi, carol.
why... why are you making this so hard?
yeah.
go.
angela.
as you know, ed truck is dead.
okay.
sorry.
yeah, i bet it is!
say goodbye to wasteful buildings.
welcome to our little kingdom.
i do not understand a word of it.
dunder mifflin is about to be sold.
you know it.
we will put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
i have some news.
now, go make your hands rough with work.
holly's favorite.
stanley of course.
snack attack time.
how do you know that?
erin, i want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables.
let us just knock this out right now.
she is a hazard to the other people of the office.
let us go.
can i sit down for a second?
andy?
let us talk.
cheer or fear?
hooters?
i love it all.
okay, this is the fine work award.

oh my god, how long was i out?
are we ready?
look at his life!
you know what?
barbeque at jim's tonight.
it is from battlestar galactica.
alright .
sounds fun.
this reservation seems to be under an m. scott.
uh... ten year.
good.
also, i can not wear this anymore.
uh... i can not really hear you.
really good breakfast place.
well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.
yeah.
here we go.
there will be food.
i... yes.
my ass is is on the line!
um, when people say something is mutual, it never is.
now, I am in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.
who is it?
you can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want.
who needs a new tractor anyway?
raise your cups on high.
come on pretty boy.
you have got it, you have got it.
look they got pillows.
you could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.
oh is it really?
oh god!
"michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the cfo, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company.
it is the safest part of the car.
this is jim!
it is not going to have a big, fat, gross santa claus.
it was beautiful.
wow, i knew you would win, but you just demolished him!
and if not we can just make him disappear.
she totally got me.
have you ever seen him play tetris?
it takes a big man to admit his mistake and that is what i did.
gays are not necessarily who you think they are, people.
we are infinitely sorry.
oh, man.
you know what jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
you are black, stanley!
and you are a princess?
so who is the real criminal?
you seriously said that?
michael winslow, anyone?
i have it on good authority that you said the following.
boom!
keep the change.
nobody needs your help.
last sunday i had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
it can not have two players.
dwight, ryan, i want you to take the table out.
oh, that is a shame.
bring it in!
oh, really?
waaaaah!
i will seduce her.
well, if that is the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
i begged you to pretend to be chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be chuck!
hey, hey, hey.
oh, okay.
line up, throats together.
hello!
especially considering his height to weight ratio.
mr. ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I am interested in your daughter?
all right, yes.
did you hear what i said?
stand back!
this is an inflatable sumo suit.
it is okay.
simple...  kids love candy bars.
where does he live, guys?
lauren,  enough with the pencils.
call me any time of the day or night.
she already has a stroller.
read this,  and make it sound perfect.
i got it covered.
whoa!
dwight, what will happen to that family if i call david and give him this information?
no.
holly's coming from new hampshire.
here, here... just... good, we have a deal?
i am ready for my performance review.
well, it should be.
it is very good.
well, in his infinite wisdom, david wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of dunder mifflin.
which is a shame, because i hear he is a very reasonable guy.
right.
sorry, rolf goes first.
go!
so how did you deal with people not liking you?
inappropriate.
okay, alright.
and they had no yams?
i will talk to her.
I have just waited for this moment my entire life.
i love  them.
mm.
we are all brothers and sisters.
gyah!
you can- i -you know what, i have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk.
well, there are many things, i believe, that do such a thing of that nature.
nothing.
i, i need something to wipe my hand.
oh!
yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
haha, come on!
that was great, she gets it!
ohmmm... ohmmm... everybody sit on the floor indian style like me.
noooo!
pam, that was amazing.
your gayness does not define you.
only other people.
half of  them, we were on the same team.
no... no.
big, one, two, three.
i am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper.
supplier relations.
there are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying.
shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 psi, bon appetit!
well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
i might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
no cleaning up!
in a folder?
and he sat at my desk.
jim, what are you doing?
well,  busier.
ryan is going to be the main event today.
they were wrong.
it is always you.
and he was also a hero.
all-inclusive.
he even looks like a mole.
i feel like you are in a suicide cult.
yeah and then they make you drive them to church the next morning.
he is the tax man.
there he goes.
no time to lose.
sorry, I am going into a meeting right now.
we had a very truncated rehearsal time.
i like donna.
i thought he was out on the road.
that is why i brought you to the penis museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars." well, hello danny!
I will leave right away.
what?
it could be completely neutral.
i am going to give you a little blast from the past of michael gary scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'fundle bundle.' okay?
read it out loud.
okay.
look at kelly and ryan.
jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.
it is this.
hey, uh, no, please?
i used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him.
that is the way to go.
i love pad thai.
you only have me for a limited time... yes.
well, that was a waste of a text.
i wonder what is going on.
no.
the businessman... oh hi.
whiner.
hmm.
jim!
i am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
i hear your voice.
who else?
ryan.
say it.
at your stations.
my idea.
cathy, write that down and print it out.
I am good.
you do not have to convince me.
gah!!!
ah-luh-luh, a little comment.
damn it kevin, come on.
i think it is talking and being friends, and jim thinks it is moving to connecticut and being best friends with josh.
so, oh!
I am not familiar with that expression, it does not make sense, of course I am alive.
no, no.
i think jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
"according to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..."  blah, blah, blah.
this is hers, she left her glove.
he will always be my best friend.
so, like a spanish conquistador, i have come to florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
no.
i want to do it myself.
at what time?
do not freak out.
is this the only reason you are calling, jan?
jefferson.
oh, that is my favorite ocean!
what do you mean though?
transfer!
basher, thrasher, crasher and-- smasher?
just ring me up.
they need to be presented... royally... anyone?
i always think better when it is cooler.
yeah.
okay.
well, have you ever seen the movie unbreakable?
um.
y-you can-michael.
you could have said no.
how about scrantonstrangler666.
boom.
yup.
no.
maybe we are different people.
sure.
bingo!
of course.
not bad!
mmm, sure, but could i first talk to you in my office?
i slashed benefits to the bone.
oh, i do not know, james.
no.
if she eats something the fetus does not like she is screwed.
ahh, that is mine.
ok?
oh, god, what is happening?
hell, yeah.
we would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose.
now let us go over membership.
i do not know about that.
brought it in here- made copies of it- not now!
got to clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts.
because i could just click on the icon and then I am onto-- no, no, no it is not against the rules.
who is the target?
this here is savannah.
no!
supreme.
that is, that is... those are instincts that have been created by media and hype.
jim, come here.
you want to talk about fair?
no!
idiot!
right now, get in the conference room.
well you left the tv on, and your cat is dead.
no.
bang!
oh god.
this city.
um, pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off.
no, no, no.
ok, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power.
i will tell you there has been work everyday.
you ever seen a suicide?"  and i jump.
umm... mema, i think you just need to chill out about this whole pam getting pregnant thing.
seventy-two hours.
so, get excited.
uh, employer, dunder mifflin paper incorporated.
i mean, i have not done anything since christmas.
what are you doing?
what did i do?
two dollars, three dollars?
it is um, it is really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
and it caught the corner of my eye when i took mose down to the mall to get his blood pressure at the rite-aid.
michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.
he was my client for ten years!
just compare last year's order to this year's.
let me show you how this works.
not after the landmark case of shrute vs. the lackawanna county board of education.that was one case the pennsylvania supreme court got right.
no, i have the only one.
alright, everybody out except phyllis.
people always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today i had a triumph of the human body.
ok. the reason that i got bad customer reviews is because i did not!
sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
hi.
i feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other.
it could be a pedestrian.
okay, see you later.
racka do do dee do-do do-do!
it is too late.
what are you going to do now?
you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand.
educational.
holly, this is not ocean's eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and do not care about how it turns out.
like i was watching cinemax last weekend.
she was hot.
i lost my train of thought.
ransom note style.
where was the heart?
you did not have to.
a depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter." ok guys, you know what?
that, i do not... i do not... ...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
dwight k. schrute.
finish your cake, helene.
exactly, no.
but as jim and i discovered...  no!
ok!
dwight schrute, assistant regional manager.
who?
the ivan schartsky.
i would kill bin laden and then toby.
how often can you actually donate blood?
it is not like I am begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants.
a ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out.
she is only a cat.
thank you.
hold on.
or...  a whatchamacallit .
alright.
yeah?
jan loves this branch, and i think that is really more than half the battle.
did i make a mistake?
i am well.
right, have a seat.
what?
we have a meeting in the conference room, as soon as possible.
all right.
and i do not know why you downgraded what we had but i did not make us up.
okay picture this: snowy ash drizzles from the sky.
he goes to bed early.
i... if i was going to put someone in charge, i would put burt in charge or i would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like maria or gordon, maybe.
gross!
now, i am going to talk with you.
I am going to count down from ten.
but there is an easy way to find out.
really?
no!
you know, you have worked so hard for this.
there is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company.
david wallace is going to be here in an hour.
please sir!
and prison.
this is going to be awesome.
today is toby flenderson's last day.

[everyone groans and girl turns around and walks away.
be proud of your enormous monster baby.
i get it!
"please, would you be so kind as to call my wife?
voodoo mama juju... what am i going to do?
we heard it.
this morning, danny cordray stole a sale from me.
the purse girl hits everything on my checklist.
no longer a pam-jim alliance against dwight.
i do not know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I am sure that it was clove cigarettes.
aufedersein!
all I have ever wanted was to be manager here.
he said no.
please.
where are they?
yes, but i have an office, so why would i do that.
do you really, tin man?
what?
ok. um, well, did you get the second email that i sent?

oh, oh!
um... ryan?
i got this job to make some money while i continue my employment search.
he is back!
what do you say, jan?
alright, alright, alright, okay.
i would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
there is no way that hurt.
we are going down, right now.
oh!
ugh.
thank you.
i had a great idea until you ruined it.
ah!
they think that you were hired because of your good looks, which will not last long anyway.
i do not get no respect!
smeagol was corrupted and became gollum.
pflut!
so, actually jim is my enemy.
it is me dwight.
corporate chain of command.
would that make you happy?
i do not have time for your tv show.
no.
busy!
keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head.
and around the corner.
i just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
because i will have you know that that was consensual.
no.
there is a hive of bees outside the front door.
she has that kind of warmth.
i should know.
uhh... hmm... okay.
it is part of your pants.
where do we go folks?
we are half way done.
i have not seen her since.
nike.
let me see if i have his cell.
just, what I am going to do, is I am going to pretend that i am firing him, and i need you to act like i am firing him.
um, yeah.
samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.
shh.
i wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from men in black.
i would have hired all of you!
no!!
ah, the volunteer sheriff station.
well, he is not dressed in women's clothes, so... you could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
what kind of car games did you play in the 'hood?
ok. did everybody get one of these?
oh, yeah.
fire andy.
only if he fails.
macgruber!
that is insultingly low.
you having fun?
if you do not let me pursue my artistic vision, i am going to walk!
schrute.
listen.
do it, michael.
awesome.
would you care to bang it out over lunch?
eight months?
alright.
oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
okay i am the bait.
and, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 grand .
that snake!
you have got the life, my friend.
if i do, everyone wins.
it is a done deal.
whoa whoa whoa!
i should be mad at you guys.
or judge judy.
phyllis, you want to give it a shot?
i said that yesterday.
just sign your name below.
you know what i was thinking might be sort of fun?
yes!
right.
let us - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman.
pam-elama-ding-dong.
uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop.
this is plenty complicated.
i have not heard the same about you.
it was done out of love, just like i thought.
and there are- no no no wait!
am i scared of a stupid computer?
he is happy because he is insane.
i am also considering stanley because of all the good that black people have done.
that is just a verb.
because he is mean.
everybody stop working.
you saw the movie, those of you who did.
oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
it was good.
what?
i want to put the top down.
how do you-ho.
it is bitter because i slightly destroyed a wonderful little family.
and you know what I would like?
it was urine.
a spy from the warehouse.
hey right, i have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
do not, oh... this is egregious!
pervert.
you are!
they are good sure.
someday, we will both get together in comstock hall and just laugh about all of this.
oh.
you are not prone to seizures?
it was not me.
we are famished!
it is a lullaby.
i want him to have all the urine he needs.
who am i playing?
why do not we... here you go.
michael, what time should i be arriving?
wha?
there is a photo... these are cautionary tales for kids, my grandmata used to read these-- nazi was a fascist movement... ...from the 1930's... i was going to teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
this is just guys gently ribbing each other, it is what it is all about, just hangin' out.
just like the oscars!
burgers.
like you and your son.
uh, alright, next suggestion.
we are all homos!
fine.

that is insane.
this is going to feel so good, getting this thing off my chest.
sometimes we will just meet in the middle.
yeah.
flush him towards the door.
I am hip and I am jive!
what can i do better?
yo-da.
I am not busy at all, I am not doing anything.

it was not poison jim, it was a laxative.
oh, time and resources.
a little over the top, do not you think?
word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
it is now worth three grand.
ah.
he is just... everybody.
see you in a few months.
oh!
it is just... you are right.
how... how did he take it?
okay, um, oscar, I am going to need to take another advance on my salary.

thank you.
with a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.
we are all friends.
no way.
just, just... yeah.
we will do it quickly.
used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves.

one fun one.
scranton strangler's in the house.

and i will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it is ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we will do it on my dime.
I am guessing he is some kind of friend.
it was on you tube.
yeah.
were you raised in a household with no consequences?
is this how you are with pam?
it is done.
what i do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.

i do not know whose fault it was.
twenty minutes a day jim, that is all it takes.
to love the ones that you see.
everybody loves ping.

kevin nealon.
i did.
uh... why do not you move that coat rack?

there he is.
you never expect that you are the killer... it is uh... great twist.
no, i want to seduce her.
or can you?
yes.

and you know what toby?
end of story.
it is not a matter of more or less.
people turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my nana's investment club can help the michael scott paper company become a reality, then I am sure that is what she would have wanted.
for instance, the time i brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
i think it did.
he knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
like a taxicab?
well then you are not going to talk to the new building owner.

I have gone over this lineup very carefully.
aa-aaah!

you me?
i studied him, to figure out why i hated him so much.
how are you guys doing?
everybody settle in.

in the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
you have worked up quite a sweat.
any messages?
no.
well, you know what, everybody thinks that i am crazy, and that tells me that i am the sanest person i know.

phyllis, my sister?
very inspirational.
i ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than i have in my entire life.

so why do not you have everybody work on their expense reports and I would like them in by the end of the day.
i can do that...  my resolution is... meet a loose woman.

same old.
yes, yes i am.
just read from- just read the cards.
how did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
I am suspicious of this because i had the exact same idea, for catching osama bin laden.

that is how it works.
oh jim, I am not going to quit.

you really think hank is going to be loyal to you?
he is not afraid of anything.
whassup!
just to see what they are missing.
what kind of restaurant.
well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
this must be yours.
what?!
but you did still love him.
ho-ho, man!
guys, i believe that i have figured out what is up your butts.
guilty!

my mom, pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on I am, what is her face from quiznos, i see her four times a week.

this is wrong, this is wrong!
yes, kevin.
you have always admired it.

jim is essential to th- andy, jim is just too...essen-... this is stupid!
because you are interested in going into sales?
well, that is... yep, never been used.
hit the scales, everybody.
i been on to you and your little friends for weeks.
try againaEUR  ugh, I am still getting numbers!
unfortunately, i have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with david wallace.
so these are pizza dogs, they are not pigs in a blanket per se.
that was very nice of him.
we need new chairs.
i was soft inside, there was something going on.
welcome to the club, pig!
and i want you to know that anything and everything can be said.
like butter.
I would like everybody's attention.
some of these people are for real.
pastry cubes made of sugar and fat?

no.
mmm, i wonder if it is as safe as they say it is.
how about, uh, fine arts?
oh, oh, i see angela.
it does not have to be that dramatic, jim.
i think i have a frog in my throat.
i am your boss and i may someday be your father, so get out.
jim could not even stay till the end of the party.
ha ha.
guh!
i do not want to throw a wrench in the works, but i want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me- okay, great.
look  i gave him a six foot extension cord so he can not chase us.
shut it.
this is one of our staff.
how have we never talked about this before?
i had rebound?
oh, really?
going to sleep it up all night.

everyone here knows that i can not and will not keep a secret.
and the strangest thing happened.
ok... ignore him.
nope.
what is your problem man?
come on!
keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.
i knew it the whole time, buddy!
how dare you all attack him like this.
um... i was wondering if i could ask a personal question about her.
okay.
just ask charlie brown.
you would?
um... shalom.
and yeah, you know what?
jim!
hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if i were to ask you?
ok everybody, I have figured it out.
okay.
sounds like a good dentist.
yeah, just wait.
all right.
take a seat down there.
guys?
what was that for?
i bet you would love all the details, would not you?
is why.
she hit me?
i never should have played that joke on erin.
we are a team.
hi.
that - that was embarrassing.
hey, dwight.
i do not understand.
ok, i have an announcement.
you can go to hell.
they took my card away because i spent $80 bucks at a magic shop.
no.
but i would like to if i wanted to.
he is a good guy, not a terrorist.
you are worried about the party?
hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
do not, do not.
you know what is important?
michael can come home with me.
well, you are going to have to run, or you are going to be in a lot of trouble.
why?
no nobbies, no probbies.
all right, everybody in the conference room!
do not you realize the key is inside you?
it is a miracle.
it is every parent's dream.
you see this on my desk?
wow!
eldred called it "hay world".
do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
check it out.
you are making me throw up, ryan.
he is not.
family only.
now keep me company for one more mission.
yes.
if pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to.
it is.
mmmmmm.
yes!
public tv is bust.
i have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
dunder mifflin family only.
stanley, phyllis.
that is just stupid.
would you like some french toast?
go to your room.
ok, that is great.
get in there!
i like the way you think.
give some to oscar.
and he may just make it.
just fun, healthy young woman.
i do not know you.
and now... the wedding has no highlight.
I am in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton, pennsylvania but I am also the founder of diversity tomorrow, because today is almost over.
good.
well guys, I would love to go to bernie's with you, but, you know, i have an office party.
yes, you did.
hey guys.
no.
well, I am one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... because pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at buckingham palace.
ok.  oui.
I am on it.
but you are right.
i decided earlier.
no, no, no, just... that is not his real name.
you are screwed!
I am sorry, michael i did, michael.
I am a jamaican zombie woman.
no.
you never yell at the client.
been there, done that.
mikey likey.
the stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
knock it off, okay, I am interviewing you.
oh, so that is how it is going to be.
nothing.
have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses?
an a.l.f.
damn it, jim!
lot of dough.
now that i have your attention... money!
this is war and that is what happens.
i feel terrible about it.
i should be there in about 15... that is what she said.
ok, press conference in 45.  dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
because I am the manliest man in the office?
i have to do something to his eyes.
please put on your blindfolds.
okay, everyone.
you do not leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in connecticut.
and I am surprised that you did not question me in the first place.
if we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours.
they are really angry.
yes, we have to!
because this is an image that i want you people to remember for a long time to come.
you are so busted!
one?
no.
for what?
pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel.
ooh.
michael... wait, i got it!
I will get the pizza!
she just knows that she is turned on.
did you know that lincoln's secretary was named kennedy.
I am trying to get some work done.
marching or garage?
ok. i love it.
ladies and gentlemen.
let me answer this.
right now!
or, uh, "super duper paper.
karen filip...  ka-ren fili-pell-li.
ok, fine, have it your way.
to intimidate my subordinates.
those can not be my scores, jim.
I will give you a hint.
first you jump ship.
... and i robbed.
heart is.
well... there is a security guard coming by.
is that your stomach?
ok, probably going to go late tonight.
that is what i say, so... meredith, bad breath.
keeya eyah!
that cool?
I have caught jim talking to himself several times today.
i could have done this investigation in like twenty minutes.
why do not you come by?
and i will be taking questions.
jim!
here we go.
crap!
absolutely.
dwight.
do not make me pre-fire you.
heh heh heh!
surrender the tripack.
little homework over here?
no, i will.
phyllis.
I am kidding.
michael, I am just about to close a sale.
do you know what the f. stands for?
gah.
all this arguing reminds me of a very funny story.
nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them.
cocaine.
uh huh... big... all right!
anybody read the news any more?
you like coal mines and you want to see  them, well, check it out, yo, the anthracite museum!
i have been recommending downsizing since i first got here.
I am in the, I am in the sex shop.
i worked.
actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
we had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
you know what?
goot.
michael.
the principle is sound.
because i was thinking we could go to this concert.
i am upper management.
and that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing.
you know what, I am actually going to bid on this.
probably been a lot funnier.
all right!
you promised us whales.
so... there is your barrette.
yeah.
when you got transferred, and i drove you up to nashua, you said, "michael, i love you, but i can not do this." but then, with this other guy, you do not have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you?
today's a big day.
okay, well-- i will-no, no.
that is good.
what?
new york.
ah, la, la, la.
i know.
all right.
i will call david wallace.
uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
it is going very well.
with the jello.
now hit me.
no.
contractions are coming every ten minutes.
hello, rock 107.  am i the 107th caller?
i can be very suprising.
no.
i always have, david.
just do your best buddy!
is that how we are going to get past this?
you know how?
last time you saw the victim, was he happy?
think happy thoughts.
okay, where were we?
you failed?
how are ya?
nope nope nope no.
so, how did oscar sound when he called in?
aaaagh!
there are certain defining moments in a person's life.
what is the fist?
I am going to grab a glass of water.
i just wanted to get you here.
you are leaving?
why?
but michael thought that samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
ahh!
table for four.
burned my foot, pam.
got it?
you know what my favorite season is?
it is paper.
so start hanging these all around the building.
fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
these babies are thin.
all right.
so everybody has a different race.
just do a cartwheel!
it did, it did.
oh... oh god.
i do not want to talk about that.
oh, gee, I am sorry.
oh no.
you know, i like you.
i am not a liar.
queen's higher.
she treated me poorly.
does not matter.
now, hurry up, shut the door.
wrong.
that is funny!
alright, give it up.
... I am just kidding.
let me give myself a countdown, ready?
it is like...  you know what I am talking about?
charles and i were waiting for you.
no, I am serious, we do not have to put up... is it the dogs?
and the reason you are here is that i need ideas for things that donna and i could do on the weekend.
oh, my man.
sheriff, this is volunteer sheriff's deputy dwight schrute.
god!
i have a job.
no.
why is my office black?
can you believe it?
oh.
now, you need to sell those in order to have a payday .
so, you know, come up with something.
they say the best vampires do not bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again.
you have to snare it.
i need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration.
chillin'.
bah!
oh, my god.
yeah, that is actually a really good idea.
sounds like a plan.
i found it under the seat.
do you know anybody in the mob?
did you know i used to be in hr?
ok, well payroll is in charge of all that.
and rabies wins.
the real smart car is kitt from knight rider.
no, I am carrying around the stick in order to look cool.
alright?
I am sorry.
i just do not understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
thank you.
nurse, you know that baby in there, baby philip?
i would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey.
the small business man?
a gay.
thank you, randy.
i can not tell.
he -- please, mr. buttlicker -- please give me another chance.
all right girls break it up, you are being infiltrated.
no, you are remembering it wrong.
ha ha!
bommmm.
how did they get al roker to come?" yes you can.
you talking to me?
that would not seem genuine.
i- okay, let us switch to the happy video, okay?
yes, and i am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days.
let us do it.
um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
was i, creed?!
m-m-munchies.
one, two... find a key.
mm-hmm.
why is it so hard to meet people?
look at that.
there just were not enough clients for the two of you.
i will loan it to you.
okay, that is called a compromise.
today is the first day of sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores.
am i shiny?
i appreciate that.
i would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying.
i want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five slough avenue.
go!
thought you might hit me.
how much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership?
no, it -  what will be the state of this company if i am the only one coming up with the great ideas?
i sent you a facebook message yesterday, i still have not heard anything back.
what is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
push it!
see ya!
it is a little bit bigger than i remember.
i have taken a unique part of who you are, and i have used that to memorize your name.
i am truly impressed.
very good, jim.
the belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
obvious, but interesting.
this is stanley hudson, one of our talented salesman.
not at all.
attention, everyone!
it is just elegant.
you showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.
why can not i pull the trigger on any of them?
I am doing this for appearances.
i could have helped.
this is whose line is it anyway?
well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like jordan and pippin!
you know, darryl is actually the foreman here and not roy, which is cool.
went home to all the kids.
and that is that we are all very lucky to have her here.
shacka do do!
and that is lonny.
no.
alright.
you called dunder mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
scissor me.
ready?
I will pay to have her stuffed.
you guys looks great.
okay, email accounts.
i am serious, we are all serious.
great.
... because we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt.
I will tell you something charles, i do not even care.
does he have access to their medical records?
what he is not telling you is that he will abandon you.
oh, okay.
almost as good as the first day when we first met.
sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
no.
okay, well, let us... .
well, we have a surplus.
so pick a spot.
have a seat, phyllis.
i thought i did.
it barely even feels like a prank anymore.
with snowballs, jim?
what can i say?
what?
oh, no, no.
and if it could not go to ryan, you are the guy I would want it to go to.
I will have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known.
walk out of the house... ...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine.
unless you mean gonorrhea.
i can not help but think that something we did made this possible.
he is been promoted to sole manager.
no, we can not.
berp.
picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
i do.
what does that mean?
i sent it back.
just get in the coffin.
now, let us discuss precipitation.
ah, jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the dundies.
oh.
alright, you drive.
or at least a the one.
all right.
that is the danger i found myself in today.
that is a good firm handshake.
your nose?
who are you talking to?
yes, but he does not want to know when, or whom.
why do you always say that?
ok, he is a youthful cat.
3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in asia so the numbers just do not add up.
i want you to meet my family.
what she actually said was,  "what is with him?
thank you.
scott.
what is that?
how do you know that?
just take them.
we are in the real world.
jeez, that is good.
eight minutes!
i gave it to you in the car.
you got to help me here.
the way i see it, it is getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.
...i do not hate it, i just do not like it at all.
that is not important, jim, i just think we should not listen to any of that crap.
what is this meeting about?
working in an office can lead to depression.
it is a booze cruise!
michael, can you explain?
good, good, good.
37. I will call you back.
well, i think we can all totally agree that holly is totally fantastic.
my girlfriend carol is coming to our party tonight, and i have a little surprise for her.
did you see oprah yesterday?
okay.
she gets it.
and maybe you should cry.
wow!
not so fast.
you did not poison me, it is just stress.
when held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.
mr. bill.
I am trying to write something funny.
and that is who i thought he was.
this is not 'lord of the rings'.
um...  oh, ryan, you are so smart.
great.
wow!
well, people hear a lot of things, man.
what about our truce?
no!
how many years, creed?
no, jim.
and one would be humor.
wake up!
actually, i am meeting somebody, but I am a little bit early.
yeah!
i would love that.
i have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
i might see a movie.
well, i have been booked for three years, so you should have that.
i do not believe you.
you and dwight were close.
no, toby is terrible.
no, we would never do that.
and by gay i mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all.
alright, i am a local business owner.
oh.
the two of us.
you used lady on her back, did not you, you freak.
it is just coffee, guys!
you were laughing.
that was the last signature i needed.
right.
we will start our own paper company.
spice girls are opening for weird al.
okay.
that is what she said.
yeah?
because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job.
i want to keep those so i can see what i sent.
ever since michael dumped jan for carol, jan's been bitching out on him.
there he is.
happy birthday to you.
someone must have seen something!
i am telling andy.
how could robert transfer nellie here after the sabre store debacle?
do people respect him?
there are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad.
okay?
no.
okay.
dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
i do not know.
here is the deal.
it is because of where we are.
real good.
let us just say we all did it.
it is michael.
i can not really explain it.
i do not know.
hey, we should have a calendar printed up.
was its heart beating, toby?
they are good, huh?
yeah.
customer loyalty.
i... i did not do that.
it will be towed by a donkey.
took a little nap right next to jim's desk.
yeah, pretty much.
ah, angelo.
do some... do some work.
that is right.
this is just gross.
that, uh, you really pulled that one out.
put 'er there.
keep it up stanley and you will lose new year's.
certificate of bravery, from the scranton police department.
you do not- you do not know anything.
uh-huh.
oh, that is great.
mine was green.
right.
of-kay.
yeeesh.
he can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master.
that is right!
I will be in my office.
find a box for him.
of course, of course.
do you have your own hazmat suits?
hmm?
where great paper is our passion.
bye.
os-car!
shhh!
charging.
bye, bye, ms. chair model lady.
but i thought that you were exactly awesome.
you have not buried her yet?
it was andy's idea.
these are our accountants.
after i write you up for insubordination.
what do i do?
anybody else.
i just need to tell them.
no, no, no, no.
pam you are an artist, right?
yeah.
it was a crime of passion, jan, not a disgruntled employee.
judas.
do not ever touch a black man's radio!
look, i have a whole program planned.
okay, i... you know what?
well, fine.
i would have, except i did not know about it.
three bedroom, two bath... ...contemporary townhouse.
i apologized for that.
i do not know.
will they throw their hats, you think?
what i want all of you  to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them.
here.
come quick.
oh, boom!
and um... thanks for coming in.
very impish.
i think you have.
no.
i would like a pair of size nine, please.
and i think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other.
every day is black tie optional!
people take laxatives all the time.
hr stuff?
we will go clubbing with ryan.
what is our topic?
thanks.
come on in.
budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is going to be a fight to the death.
oh.
that could have gone one of two ways, but i never expected her to get upset.
oh, and get this.
I will take her to lunch.
oh, have you not?
no.
look at that.
looks like i am the killer.
and turmoil!
do you like tcby?
i really think you screwed the pooch on one, creed.
well,  hey pam, did you get that down?
okay, um, today we are going to be talking... about...powerpoint!
see that?
not that a lot of people here in america know what a sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a sensei.
no, i think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
thank you, andy.
actually, today's a good day to do that.
flat-chested.
aww, none of your business.
from when he recommended me to replace him.
so beautifully written.
i highly recommend you wear that.
ohh...too much strudel.
tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all - it is all good.
ok. very good.
jim halpert.
somebody get jim, please!
how contagious is that, is that like an std?
and the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
no, it was stupid.
i would say yes but you can not.
leave it, i mean it.
do you want to do that?
i do not need you to give me a history lesson.
guys!
got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to.
no, baah!
kevin do your taxes.
just the one window?
who are you really?
so i think i will just...drag it out.
ball is ours.
an "x." oh.
after his epic battle with ravana, the demon king of lanka.
good.
I am leavin' inside jim's car, i do not know when I will be back again.
out of the way!
these two.
haulin' cube!
i realize that a lot of you have already heard that martin here has had some trouble with the law, but i just want to declare publicly that i... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who does not is an ignorant, dumb... person.
they could call at any second now.
that is my rebuttal.
and i vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
so, i am going to... give her a ride home.
guzzled it down.
the schrutes are a very loyal breed.
close your eyes.
sounds a lot like dentist.
ok. what about the rest of you?
oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town.
open for business!
thank god.
mmm.
that would be bad.
off the backboard!
ok, what is going on here?
listen up, everyone!
who is that?
i do not understand.
come on up here.
um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very pg-13 rating picture of me and a woman-- no, kevin.
dwight.
would you like more proof?
the jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
why do not you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
no, it is not.
what are you saying?
sure!
jim, right here, right here.
you were listening in on that?
no.
dunder mifflin's treat.
you okay?
ok, let us go have some fun.
that is impossible.
come on.
hey!
and I would point to them, right?
let us do it.
maybe to buy some printers, so... right here, we have the wonder twins, jim and pam halpert.
but, one question at a time please.
oh, you know what, you have a siphon?
conference room five seconds!
moral.
no way.
so... oh, donna?
corcroan dropped staples.
who does not know?
stop it!
i owe you an apology.
which one's yours?
it is got to be now.
handsome, good listeners, funny, mr. wonderful.
jim, you have got those two cute kids.
with pleasure.
dwight, you are a kiss ass.
let us celebrate diversity.
i bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
you cannot learn from books.
yeah!
just the two of us from this point out.
and most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay?
frosting.
listen, could i talk to you a second about the... paper products?
show  them, show  them the other side.
who thought it would be hysterical to give toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
gabe?
um, guys, where you going?
no, i insist.
oh yeah?
dwight's going to be able to build himself a friend!
get  them there.
what about a raise based on merit?
because you think he is funnier than you?
jim!
am or pm?
well in the future please identify yourself as such.
talk like you are talking to that race.
i want you to get her to be in this commercial.
what the hell was that?
sure.
should be.
he decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day.
okay...  phyllis.
everything's great.
yeah, I am pretty excited too.
monkey, i am an a. r. m., assistant regional manager.
I am sorry, toby.
good.
hold your breath.
he specializes in free speech issues.
oh, no no no.
i will be taking jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.
well, jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
no, that is enough.
gross, oh!
push free play til tomorrow morning.
i am here to see you off.
jim!
this is where you will have your receiving line.
okay.
hah!
so just shout it out.
phyllis!
so i was in the office, and i look over to our accounting division, and there is kevin malone.
this is not just a business.
this will only up my game.
when jim is gone, andy and i are in charge.
it was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and... i just hope that you and i can remain friends.
fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
well, they are just for guests.
I am kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I have never actually done this before.
jim and pam!
I have got an idea: why do not you leave right now.
troy, do you know anything about this?
no, singles only, singles only.
eeee.
uh, michael knows pam.
great ideas are just part of what i bring to the table.
you are right, phyllis, but I have been there before.
just so you know, he is at his funniest when you have given him five shots.
really did not give it any thought.
i really can not say.
phyllis and meredith are not little.
go bag!
if you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.
he is my nephew.
so that is no help to us.
yuh, yuh, yes!
michael's number one.
hey.
have you heard of paper?
are you... are you sick, oscar?
but he is unavailable.
... wow, that is good timing.
good, real personal.
dwight, come on.
and how is that been going?
you are glad?
I am been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
because they promote from within.
i just do not know.
it is about this very announcement you just made.
oh, okay.
well, we had the scranton white pages.
here is an attaboy for ya!
just... why?
she is going to freak out!
i know that a lot of you are very angry with ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, i swear to god, if any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or... yeah.
ok. I am sorry.
or do i have to?
what is going... what is going on?
oh, was he?
blooo!!
now i know there is some rumors out there and i just kind of want to set the record straight.
i get up to the building, i get to the revolving door... broken!
hi, children.
aaaaaaaa!
go go, peel out, go.
okay, fine.
michael.
i share my birthday with eva longoria.
i do!
in this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body.
you can do it at home by yourself with your finger.
he is running, but he can not hide because you know what?
stay- oh!
um, why do not you wait in my office.
bam!
welcome children of the scranton industrial park community.
ok, foul.
mm.
the ship is sinking!
and i was sitting at this desk when i called you to tell you that i had herpes and that i was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you did not love me.
is that the beak!?
oh.
yes!
so you want to?
just unwarranted.
i can not risk them coming back to schrute farms.
haha, oh.
that way i will not have to get her a gift.
well fought.
i feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth.
why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
