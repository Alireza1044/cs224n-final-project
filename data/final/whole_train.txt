no, you do not.
would not you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
pam, hello.
oh.
god!
thanks for calling us all down here.
it is all good.
yeah.
we... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
no.
I have never heard of such a thing.
do you-would you have a snack in your purse?
i have to say, i think the problem with that whole thing... ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
phyllis, we are going to put you in here.
how did you get in your wheelchair?
or at least a the one.
a guy told me about that.
no drama.
just doing my job.
no.
it is your funeral.
you do not get to do your farming.
me chief michael scott.
we need to just get one picture where we are all in the air at the same time.
you heard me, pack your things.
what are you doing?
mm-hmm.
all right.
so, how you doing?
dwight schrute!
I am going in for a procedure today.
the businessman... oh hi.
hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
do you want to play another game?
who is the father?
all-inclusive.
no reason.
this is you.
you here to tell me that you think i would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
ok... alright... here we go.
get out!
good work, stanley.
no, no.
you shove it.
I will just get up myself.
also, that may not be his real hair.
a woman should not have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies.
i just do not want to go by myself.
my management style?
no, no, no, no.
oh, god, this is bad.
is this your car, ryan?
what are you talking about?
what?
any emails today?
it is too early to tell.
makes me question the whole judicial system.
it is after 5:00, jim.
what time did you go home last night?
oh well, we will have to go someplace else then i guess.
for it is... ok, thanks.
hey, kelly.
this is dwight schrute.
one of the many defects of their kind.
no better, no worse.
it is that easy?
you are going to have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
look at all those staplers!
i did not sign up for this.
anything new on youtube?
hey, what is up, kid?
right?
what was that?
there has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.
he is already dead.
mmm-uh-mm  hello, this is dwight schrute calling from dunder-mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.
she called you d?
I am just kidding.
who would you do, roy?
and you tried to get off the party planning committee.
here is the thing.
no, no, I am okay.
five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.
oh, our contract.
that is the michael scott guarantee.
nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it?
that is weekend at bernie's.
oh.
come on, let us go.
i have a company to run.
michael would never let me... i could never do that!
okay, um...  that is as clear as i can make it.
does anyone smell anything smoky?
... i am really proud of you.
well, then it would not be the first time i stole something away from coach shane.
pssht.
as soon as possible.
matter of time.
a statue.
many of your blouses are claiborne's.
back then my life was so great that i literally wanted a second one.
hmm?
everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.
uh... yeah i got a '78 280z.
no.
no, you may not.
new york.
think happy thoughts.
now you believe in dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
i love this car.
no plus one's.
yes!
and yeah, jim this is the time to stop putting dwight's personal effects into jell-of.
"the soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly..." alas, after much consideration and deliberation... whoa!
alright.
bang!
what?
these covers are totally indestructible.
i would like to give you, the only copy, of somehow i manage.
hate to break it to you oscar but some of us like boobs.
it... for example, every year i get a $100 gas card... can not put a price tag on that.
there is a point there.
just- yep.
that is enough!
what?
i... do not.
the funda-mentals of business.
hey.
oh, do not start, you know what?
there is no telling what i might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
you know, give yourself an exam.
not a giant net.
that is fun.
today is the big day that i am heading to new york to attend a party with sushi and important people.
now, you are to use one check a year.
and as much as i think you are a great guy, and i like you, you are... you are, goodbye.
that is what she said.
phyllis?
yeah, definitely.
one word, two syllables.
glee right?
do this.
excellent.
turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar.
hut!
i was 25 years old before i saw my first human being.
doctor frankenstein, doctor jekyll, not them.
i know, i know.
my belt's made out of alligator.
so the next day, i decided to make that sandwich.
there is one that sounds like a jackhammer.
what a waste of a day.
oh man, you should order milk.
michael, I am just about to close a sale.
woo!
and look, something he whittled.
so can we come in?
get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every monday for the next seven mondays.
well, the other night, i was sitting at the table, eating my penis... i mean peas.
meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
i had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
did you pass out in there?
pretty good.
no.
stanley!
oh, you startled me.
when i think about it, when i really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
it is that one.
wrong.
it is not necessarily different for the woman- ...but it is different for the- ok. ok. alright.
oh, do we?
in this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body.
so much for keeping our secrets up high.
all righty.
is that supposed to scare me?
i guess you said something weird about your daughter?
you are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
brides side or grooms side?
my supplier relations rep, meredith palmer, is the only person i know who knows how to properly head bang to motorhead.
it will last longer.
that is a picture!
what is the dealio?
you will wish you were dead.
dammit, phyllis!
what is up?
seven minutes.
that is his punishment for not being here on time.
so go home get some rest, very very good work today.
well, this year's going to be different.
yes, i will.
i thought i was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on!
interesting.
because the book said it is best to wait till the end of the day.
and i can not help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "how could they do this to us?" it is not... nevermind.
no, i will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
why do not i come with you.
yeah, yeah he is the worst.
yeah, how ya doing?
i do not really know what to say.
women are attracted to power.
but, santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
could you start that one from the beginning?
okay, close your eyes, we need you to think.
these are english... uh... letters.
dwight?
there we go.
i played the part of mutey the mailman.
I have got gas all over my hands and my shoes.
that is-i put everything i had into that audition.
i want her tailed.
i do okay.
do not!
congratulations resourceful salesman.
hey, tobes.
this is jan levinson-gould.
if she starts having sex with me I will know for sure.
you want to learn a really impressive second language?
it is... hey're making a huge, huge mistake.
oh god.
spiderman, peter parker, would not reveal his love for mary jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the green goblin.
phew, freaked myself out this morning.
done.
dwight is an idiot.
you know what?
just,  boom.
hank, hank!
jan levinson-gould.
oh, i do not know.
are you going to discipline him or not?
you know what?
why do you lie, liar?
i am so deliriously happy... because you are pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together.
are you kidding me?
i mean, are we ugly?
you are talking about jim and pam, if they are having sex, what it looks like, i know, i think-- hey, hey, hey.
and wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food.
thirty-one is my new number.
I am not following you.
all right!
oh pam.
good morning sir!
no.
old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!
I am cool, I am cool, I am so cool.
and because you are gettin' old.
this is not michael scott talking right now, this is your future.
wow!
jo collects them.
well then it is a happy ending, because he was gay.
um... yeah.
david wallace is going to be here in an hour.
um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we will be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.
impish or admirable.
thank you doctor.
a lot of weight.
i do, too.
first victim, this is what i want you to do.
you really screwed that up.
ok, ok, ok. alright.
this big fat pig is beautiful.
this is hannah smoterich-barr.
well, that is kind of a tough assignment.
shrunken chesticles.
no, that is good.
male, age 37... mocha complexion.
what?
I am facebook.
i want you all to imagine a world in which america is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello.
and I will go back to jan, and i hate jan!
yes!
boom.
it is a sign.
no i disagree.
thank you.
we are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages.
i do not want to die!
check it out.
he is not going to college.
stop it!
i was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
slytherin are the bad guys, jim.
welcome to our humble abode.
her words, not mine.
brenda, could jan and i have a moment alone?
...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
you give me a tape of your band and a tape of the steve miller band and I will get back to you.
he is going down our street!
he was much more articulate and that was better.
hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if i were to ask you?
you are going to need to be more specific.
there is no time to explain.
it is not for any disorder of the body.
stanley!
you know what my favorite season is?
in fact, where are my keys?
cut.
no.
we have a lot of fun.
gays are not necessarily who you think they are, people.
okay, you know what i want to do, i want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle.
it is like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
do you... just... you are kind of losing them.
well, i need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.
let us see what she gets.
i do not know, it could be any number of people.
i could be french.
yes, so i know i told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I am, I am going to be leaving tonight.
what?
... I am just kidding.
whatever you got to do.
this is hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
everybody stop working.
i... you know what?
woohoohoowoo.
willing to prove himself now.
no.
very funny, jim.
respect is niiice.

"statistical correlations exist between emf radiation and various health hazards.
no way.
do you want to talk about it anymore?
he is going to love it!
kiyah!
that is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!
let us also give a shout-out to phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
time to take my talents elsewhere.
they say those who can not do, teach.
okay, i have more of them.
no other animal on earth could do this.
i did not get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me?
that is what she said.
coolio.
i am the regional manager of dunder mifflin paper products.
phyllis, can you do this?
it allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal.
he is on the roof!
you are going to drive me crazy.
thanks.
no.
he wears glasses.
and nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
i heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
shh!
well, who is laughing now?
just help me out here.
and so what if she does not wear makeup?
sorry, michael, i got calls to make.
next time you are there say "hi" to my cousin amel and then kick him in the groin area because he is a cheat and a ball hog.
would you stop it, please?
probably nothing, or strychnine.
i mean i have to play caleb crawdad, handsome playboy.
woop!
you do not want to receive three of those.
do not do it, michael.
big plans.
we had a good time.
do you have any idea how many guns trevor's had stolen from him?

i always like devon.
i have some important business matters to take care of.
now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so i can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast.
i think it would reflect poorly on us.
catch you guys-  catch you guys on the filippity flip.
... exactly.
it is possible that i could be talking about us.
it is a miracle, you are at your desk.
i have not thought about you having to go back to nashua.

and business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.
were you raised in a household with no consequences?
i guess i get it.

still, i think there might be something wrong with january no need for consternation, everything is under control.
okay.
when you have done something good, you will receive one schrute buck.

he knows more about business than you ever will.
hi, everybody.
i have seventy.

scranton is not lame.
that is like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
uh, you are not going.
no, I am not saying we do those things.
hey, you wanted to see me?
and i have a hover-car and a hover-house.
it is a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
i will get to that definitely.
come to me, necropolis.
no!
what about all these people, huh?!
what is this?
at the playboy mansion.
wow.
david it is not very well written, but you get the gist.
when it came to manured fields, angela was at best indifferent.
the trip sucked, david.
now, what are our choices right now?
dwight.
i wonder if she wants a snack.
customer loyalty.
this is not my music.
who is that?

let us do it.
man what a day huh?
oh... actually, tomorrow's not good.
excellent, here we go.
yes.
smile and nod.
aj.
maybe it is because i did not understand it.
but a good informer does not judge what is worth passing on.
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
it is what i would want if you were mine.
here.
and sometimes i can hardly handle that!
now it is all about my instincts.
last time i went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
uh huh... big... all right!
that is not true.
oh my god.
sometimes you have to go for it.
oh, no.
okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, kevin.
it is not scary.
ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: assst... ...trid levinson.
yes!
vamanos!
what did people believe in before?
ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait.

and fries!
depression quilt?
on a boat.
no, it is darryl.
I am caught between the toilet and the wall.
i, but if there were, I would be protected as assistant regional manager?
might be crawling with herpes.
darryl philbin is the greatest guy in the world.
whoo-hoo!
just-no, no, no, no!
he will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
leave me alone, okay?
and i... i bet he has nothing to do with that!
i need to stay in your room.
but i never forget.
yep.
um, i... yeah... maybe.
good.
let us do not... do not harsh my mellow, mon.
well, i am taking responsibility.
no, i like meredith.
also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
the important thing is i learned something.
pam, you are a member of this family.
where are we here?
hr lady, stop whispering in the corner please.
no you would not.
okay?
no.
that is on my side.
inside you will see many pelts.
I am just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
you... oh, no it is not.
how do you know?
the shield.
dwight!
and ruin their cloaks?
five of the clock sharp.
angela, you are up.
and the rest was just stuff.
i think i know what is going on here.

ok, he is a youthful cat.
um... i kind of wish I would been hit by a car.
i love finding a good set of twins.
i got a big bonus because i fired devon, and i used the money to buy something awesome.
went there again, did it again.
i now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.

alright.
hold on, i have the address in my phone.
there is no gum.

salesmen and profit centers.
sorry phyllis.
no.
you never know when it is going to strike.
oh, wow, wow.
let us go everyone.
how contagious is that, is that like an std?
the men are talking.
dunder-mifflin.
no, pam.
he is being a real twerp about it, so, it is all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
michael!
thank you.
if she was sitting across from you on a train and she was not moving, you might think she was dead.
so see you later.
first sentence is: "I am a proctologist".
that is great!
and there are only, like five or six.
we love it here.
ah.
well, i will be in my office making toys for the good children.
come down right away!
ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, i see.
stanley, you may go.
i bought music that i did not even like.
got it right here.
what am i going to do with a removed uterus?
single.
yes.
oh, hey guys.
well, now I am in a terrible mood.
oh shoot.
what was your mile time?
... probably the funny way.
none of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay?
it is michael.
it is about phillip.
also, if you have any photographs, pam will make her shredder available during lunch.
oh, sure.
try againaEUR  ugh, I am still getting numbers!
we should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than madge or heday.
i knew you would, nancy.
huh?
it could be... a... thingamajig.
alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we are going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
die.
I am taking all the credit." okay, well, that is because he is paying their salary.
he swiped the security tape for me and he is bringing it over.
and you look like one too.
you have got a ton of dandruff.
my shallow heart's the only thing that is beating... i have no idea.
that is just stupid.
his chair at his desk.
I am going to call her.
you do not- you do not know anything.
and any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.
whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
huh?
she thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.
they sound awful.
oh, my god.
dear god, do not quit your day job.
and it is something... darryl what are you doing.
ah, my skin, ow, ow!
so she is not jolly or sassy?
almost as good as the first day when we first met.
I will have a bottle of the antacid.
okay.
I would like it sent to me, please.
tah, come on dwight.
do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
it is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
yes, nice, perfect.
uh-huh.
good.
our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in scranton.
no work.
will not open it.
the sting.
you can call.
watch it, watch it.
take a gander.
plus, bonus, it is really, really funny.
i can not understand you!
welcome children of the scranton industrial park community.
do not be scared.
here we go.
oh!
oh, great.
totally throws  them off.
all we know is that a gun fired.
hey, there he is.
heh!
all right, when we get a call I will come back and you will do the smile.
kevin!
actually, no.
calling cards are... the wave of the future.
well,  busier.
grab it, grab it.
you could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets.
this is my last dundies ever, if i want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
well played.
she would get this little foam mustache... and i used to say "hey, got latte?" and she would say, that is not funny.
perfect.
hey.
during our relaxation exercise?
... you can pick that up, if you want.
mose does not know how to use a phone.
rose?
just let go.
am i the 107th caller?
ed was decapitated.
when you have somebody is attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and i experienced that firsthand today.
does that include the garage?
dear god in heaven.
i am king of forwards.
no, you are the best person for the job.
allow me.
no.
but trevor's next and he is a real professional.
really terrific.
it appears we have a three-way tie.
right.
you are finally going to get to go out and flap your wings.
why did you have to go off  and die?
every morning i email the day's security codes.
do it.
um... and i want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead.
jim was lying about jury duty.
he looks just like me.
an unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
yeah, we can stick with last year's, you are just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean?
right... what a courageous venture.
maybe.
so, um, one of the clock sharp and we have got a game on.
he shoots, he scores, yeah!
boink!
hi esther.
carol had a mustache?
you know how these things go.
would not be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
it is very funny and charming and heartwarming.
you really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
we are stuck.
roasted.
here is your cake.
andy back me up here, please.
that is why you are not on the team.
come on, everybody.
well, I am sure it will be fine.
jim, jim....
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
also, i want it to have a florida feel.
no, no.
hello.
sabre is changing everything.
i am such an idiot.
they think that you were hired because of your good looks, which will not last long anyway.
what?
wow, graphs and charts, somebody is really been doing their homework.
how as being a minority affected you?
just someone come, ok?
did you?
well... just do it, okay?
i work with michael.
i do not know.
about understanding them and learning how to get along with them.
very good.
okay, who we talking about here?
you do not have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
sure.
what do you mean by "these people"?
so... ah!
let us single... single... ok. buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
okay, anyway, welcome.
new website, blah blah blah.
lot of good stuff.
i, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
alright.
well, then... consider it poisoned beef.
this was a fake firing.
ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.
i just thought you all should know that stanley hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend karen from utica is going to give him more money to work there.
because you know what our killer is?
you will not drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
it was great.
i can not impregnate you, and that is the driving force between male-female attraction.
it is bland.
did you like that?
okay.
dwight, you have... no, you have something... god, you look like such an idiot!
um, euthanize this place.
i know.
okay?
well, okay, we can do questions.
kevin, here you go!
i will destroy everything in my path- beep!
everybody's going to be fine in exactly what they are wearing, let us go!
no.
so what was rule two?
besides, he would end up being a hero anyway.
how can i be there for michael if I am here for michael?
alan brand is the ceo of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to new york to the shareholder's meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors.
it is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
the liar will avoid direct eye contact.
book club.
wa-wait, wait, wait, wait.
it is a setup.
if i give you your clients back there will not be enough clients for ryan and pam, and i promised both of them they were going to be salespeople.
psyche.
this is mandatory.
so i can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.
i can see that as a very real possibility.
this is a pill that i found here in the office.
guests only.
oh, ok... wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second.
maybe.
do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
i called six minutes ago and no one answered.
dwight!
dale raymond corson!
i can not risk anything.
to me, pain is not pain at all.
weird.
everybody!
pam... that is my idea.
well, that is really not the way i roll, because sometimes I am in the zone, and sometimes I am in the zoning out.
hi michael!
i do not know how she dealt with that as long as she did.
make a line.
what does it say?
"hidy ho, you sexy thang.
let us keep it rolling.
ok, new idea.
i judge your year as impish.
</p> curly?
but she is in the hospital, she is fine, recovering nicely.
and yet I am hesitant.
yes well... stanley was on your group date?
there is plenty for everyone.
very good.
this thing... indestructible.
i started a fire, i started a fire.
no, no no no... no, no.
this is a skating rink and i think the rangers practice there sometimes and it is, that is tina fey .
oh, oh, oh.
okay.
it is going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere.
and we need someone to go out there and clean her up.
do not call me 'til you have it.
shh shh.
everyone calm down.
what, um... what do you think of role-play?
that is it.
no!
this summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches.
that is what she said.
but we are going on a booze cruise on lake wallenpaupack.
they should bring the stocks back.
yes, and you are my favorite client.
would you like to help me with a special project?
and, yes, it might have been funny.
seriously, do you want me to just cancel the dundies?
excuse me, I have got work to do.
it is true.
I am asking holly a question in fire.
you all skedaddled way too soon.
alright!
big day.
what could possibly be wrong?
once i brought in a duck.
so, how do i do that?
am i too short?
welcome, welcome!
still.
parkour!
what is the square footage?
did i say that?
but she will be up in... yes.
is this the cup?
lots of e-mails to amazon, lots of wasted computer space.
me, at first.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
no.
think dwight, think.
he changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk.
oh-ho!
what happened?
uh, this is dwight schrute calling for jan levenson-gould.
sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
nurse.
she treated me poorly.
i do not... well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
is that your stomach?
well, this is not about work.
james freakin' bond.
your food is no good here, my lady.
wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
which was recently discovered to be a front for the taliban.
try my googi, googi.
10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount?
i am not on trial here.
nice.
here we go, let us sit down.
fine.
let us go.
this is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts.
in that moment, i had them.
you forgetting something?
look at you, i bet you break up with a guy every hour.
you can take that off that thing, ok?
ooh.
manhattan is the other name.
so what do you guys hear?
no.
i am the big boss now.
it is not locked, give me that... it is, it is latched closed.
okay.
that question makes you sound gay.
this is for competent workers only.
money or the beet?
what is a nazi?
heh.
all right.
part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
the older you get, the bigger the chance is you are going to die.
there is no turtle, michael.
stanley?
yes.
oh mose.
oooh, okay.
i have to be liked.
listen, she ignored my ultimatum.
a little bit of paaam, all night long, a little bit of angela on the thing... ...a little bit of phyllis everywhere... ...a little bit of roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of jim with some ribs, a little bit of... will her highness, jan levinson-gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at dunder mifflin scranton?
I will call david.
did you have a... did you like your lunch?
ok. well.
what?
alright, everybody here?
pudding... I am trying to think of another dessert to do.
i know that you are going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
you are... you are worried about the cop's time?
game over.
you are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
you want to get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp.
wow.
i cut them off fresh this morning!
no, impish or admirable.
how long does it take to get in?
what are you doing?
that i was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich.
today, jo bennett, the ceo from sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time.
but first, that is not my name.
you are not dating angela anymore.
ok. ok. there an accident?
uh!
is it, is it because you are afraid of where this is going to take me?
oh, you know what?
okay, guys, guys, guys.
boom!
go.
you lost a ton of weight, literally.
this is me and my family celebrating pennsylvania dutch christmas in 1982 on the farm.
i asked you a question.
all these new business ideas and artistic projects.
this is good.
listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
it means "excellent".
well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
hello?
hey january not much, what is up with you?
this is fine.
it is got to be now.
wrong.
no!
two, incest.
so, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.
maybe you do.
you have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they are not scared when the dentist comes in.
jan, have you ever had deer?
how dare you sir.
i sit on your lap because i like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
was this a sorority that you did not get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
i am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, oscar.
how pleasant.
i love justice.
this is moe.
really?
probably a smoker, so...  so that is the way it is done.
my resolution?
people like ryan?
okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count.
well, that is not the david wallace that i remember.
i want to do it myself.

oh, yeah, that sounds good.
well, i- thanks, that is my bed.
beets are the worst.
jan, listen, i promise that i will kick it up a notch.
this is a color-free-zone here.

and I will use the paper to write my memoirs.
i say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and do not say anything about it.
all the cliques, and the office politics.
guh!
yeah, sure.
whichever corner you want.
cross it off, now.
i will drive you.
look, about you and jim.

it is also in here.
the  doctor says he would never seen it beard so quickly.
I would love a piece of candy right now.
my job is to make the speaker look good, and i do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes.
no, of course you did not.
what are my expectations for the group?
you know what?
and I have dated four women in the last- not last - no.
hello.
i did.
we crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of cindy crawford nude... that, but the women I am getting fixed up with are, egh!
I am in hell!
nope nope nope no.
it was a bad trip.
...since the world was turning.
have a good weekend.
and you look... you look fantastic.
got it.
meredith, come up here.
what?
do "we?" is that what "we" want?
now i know there is some rumors out there and i just kind of want to set the record straight.
you know what?
this is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours.
okay.
she is our receptionist.
hey, check this out.
smart broad.
you will not regret this decision, david.
the incredible nightlife?
they are on a date.

I will be down in just a second.
i fell off the toilet.
i mean, we have already put-together chairs.

no false modesty, my friend.
irrelevant.
it should be me and pete, not pete and tom.
ok,  what does this look like to you stanley?!
because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
wow, thirty years?
jim?
let us get back to the matter at hand.
in prison you are somebody is bitch.

i will wake up stronger than ever because i will have used that time to figure out exactly why i died and what moves i could have used to defend myself better now that i know what hold he had me in.
ski-sons greetings.
yuh, yuh, yes!

because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.
my question: do i do it as the man?

i am so used to fighting corporate that i forget that i am corporate.
well, shall we begin?

i mean this is really serious stuff.
dwight, just, just leave them alone please.

blah, blah, blah, blah... ...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome!
no, stop it!
less matching to appear more rich?
chicks fall down, need help getting back up.

but, frankly, I am a little appalled that none of you know very much about indian culture.
wuh-- that is crazy.
i think that is pretty interesting.
it is all hanging out- and there is parts of her i do not even recognize.
ooh, wow.
angela I would like you to come into my office in ten minutes.

I am not worried.
because he is... what?
well, yeah, i mean, what is... no reason?!
although he is probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
we are screwed.
no!
thank you.
scranton is great, but new york, is like scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.
wow!
i like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
it is rude, and unsexual.
oh, no.
it is not my decision.
holly, everybody.
i know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless.
no, come on... god!
oh god.
uh... it will be fun you should give them a call.
oh... oh, um, well, you know what?
unless it was the president.
he is not going to be a murderer.
I am just calling because you responded positively to the-- ...stanley?
okay.
are you calling me an idiot?
yeah, like a specialist.
i attended a tony robbins event by the airport last year, and... it was not the actual course.
i slashed benefits to the bone.
i forget, are you guys dating?
turn it back on.
no, not me.
but one would be good.
so just hang in there.
where is michael?
well i understand that but this is a $45 watch.
those things are tiny.
ahhh!!
it may be somebody hot, like pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like phyllis, but just not me.
huh.
keep.
i do not know, i do not know.
maybe we are different people.
listen stanley.
ran his fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he was not on the take.
today, i, michael scott, am becoming a homeowner.
your donuts make me go nuts!
oh, come on.
yes!
your fictitious name?
oh hi everybody, it is ping!
good!
ugh... that is a long story.
on my part, i did manage to reserve the... let us get the party started.
glad i remembered that.
question.
... i miss holly.
look, i need your advice on something.
and here we have stanley the manly.
here... who is here?
rule number four.
out.
guess it is just you and me, dwight.
in short... what?
reams.
you seem a little disturbed, you want to stay here?
could you just let me...  every time... every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  i take care of my kid!
inspiring words.
yeah yeah yeah yeah!
and i can not stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
you know what?
but you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way.
whacky pack.
there, there... when have you ever done that?
you are just lucky that we are at work right now.
ok, everybody.
leave, get outta here.
sounds like a plan.
I have written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and i think i have done my part with the golden ticket promotion.
mm-mm.
yeah?
better!
how are we ever to trust you again?
yes!
I would like to lodge a formal complaint against jim for making us wait for over an hour.
i feel terrible about it.
maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.
that was nice of you.
okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j jim halpert and i will fax it in to you... under you.
people, wait, wait, wait.
that is why they call it "murder." and not "muck-duck." lock your door!
i might see a movie.
I am sorry.
no!
yeah.
aaah!
i mean, i like ice cream.
whoo!
but would i put him in charge?
did i motivate you?
i will never be your vichyssoise.
i would pay to see that.
pam you are an artist, right?
really?
it worked.
she would have definitely slept with me.
i drive a smart car.' that is not smart in my book.
they are not abandoning the party.
andy!
oh, pam!
and I am going to bring my gym bag just in case.
and that is that we are... a group of people... who work together.
who does not know?
apparently, there are allegations that sabre printers can because a fire.
be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
you know what; i bet she cracked it at home.
i was under the impression that billy would be more like that guy.
please, jim.
i am fast!
let me show you to your area, sir.
yes.
pukey.
you talking to me?
do not you?
where did you eat?
ha-ha!
heads.
day one.
goldenface is going to blow up the nhl all star game tomorrow.
listen, jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what i want is more important that what you want.
you are dropping an a-bomb on me here.
something stereotypical so i can get it really quick.
ohmmm... ohmmm... everybody sit on the floor indian style like me.
could we get a delorean?
here we go.
i know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering meredith's life by hitting her, with my car.
and i would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars.
he does not love it that much.
kev...  nice.
I am kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I have never actually done this before.
it was like, "oh, ed truck is walking toward us.
alright, well, let us look at this a little bit closer then shall we?
then i will call david wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
come on!
you have got to tell andy about us.
jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is jim and pam... and me.
it is not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
dwight... no.
all right you know what?
i am teaching them a lesson, so.
gosh, i keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here.
i leave you here with my watch, and i come back later to pay for the hot dog.
here.
and they had no yams?
fine!
okay, this is it.
come on.
good, I am good, too.
question, who is the best player in the league?
i take quincy ave to gibson.
i need to buy paper.
shhhh.
sixty - forty.
come on!
where you going?
sick freak!
really?
oh my--!
okay, then i want pam back.
the first time i threw mine away, i thought it was an ant trap.
then we meet at the denny's... ...and then we compare notes.
i am a great motivational speaker.
would you say the sale that i made earlier was huge or... what was that?
relax, ok?
what am i going to do with a removed uterus?
it was fine.
you know?
i once had a dream.
you are the stupid one.
spice girls are opening for weird al.
what?
blessed be those who sit and wait.
they say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast andy's play, they took mine.
no!
hey, look!
can anybody guess who that is?
no, the cops called us.
anybody, 300 dollars.
is that all it is?
double napkins.
well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
michael scarn.
okay?
I am turning in my badge.
what?
it is all in the report.
let us go!
reverse psychology.
these resolutions should be about you, and i made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
and now you can not return it.
are you still taking the antidepressants?
have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
shaaa-shut up.
yeah, andy.
all right.
no way.
pam?
...okay.
and it worked.
we are going to - we are going to go out there during this break and we are going to come back with a plan.
ready, one, two- okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
what next?
well, so far, i think it is killin'.
why do they want me to come, too?
if anything ever happened to you, i would be very angry at myself for not doing all that i could do.
in italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.
she was lying.
i was walking in and i noticed something shinny under stanley's car and i got under to see what it was and i messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple.
are these guys boring your ears off?
no, no, no, no.
or the day after that.
well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot.
you know what?
you know what we should do?
oh... i like it!
the stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
yeah, maybe.
wait, what holly said?
what is up?
you are insane.
stop it right-stop it right now.
yes.
in addition to toby's urine being tested, i would like to test his blood and his hair.
how about a group picture while you are here?
please?
were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
is that right?
as the receptionist, pam is truly the gateway to our world.
two, maybe three if one wears out.
kevin?
well, thank you.
i do not know who you are, but you are not jim.
very good, very good.
okay, meredith is up first.
steve austin!
what?
wait, should you be going?
you say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth?
all right.
who are her co-conspirators?
there he is.
we have talking walls.
what do i do?
are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice?
what the hell is going on here?!
oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me.
a joke.
i was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
i know.
"dear dwight, by now you have received my note.
hey pack-man.
i released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily.
hmm.
funtivities!
i think it was creed.
I am the mistress?
we advance to the next round!
no.
see you later.
if it is a medium i send it back.
well, could you tell me something that i did <i>right</i>?
and, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, mrs. allen, i would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
what is on your face?
as assistant regional manager... look!
I am assistant regional manager.
could i stick it with a pin?
he is making her sell to him.
mallard.
pass.
I have made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.
sorry i forgot.
well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down.
will lady fortune be your mistress?
erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
do i need to be worried?
we are going to bust this guy.
you fold it into an airplane.
he told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 am, and i was the only one who showed up.
and if we do not get this, if we do not nail it, we are going to lose the whole triumph of the moment.
and this is where i ask you to marry me.
and, um, one down.
i do not have my wallet and i was going to try to dine and dash and that was stupid and i realize i can not do that to you fine people.
that is a great question.
yeah!
fire department was here.
nothing.
you are done.
alright let us go!
yes.
stanley was attacked by his own heart.
yes!
did you go to the one in stroudsburg?
shut it.
as long as it is downhill from the well, we should be fine.
three, two, one- five, four, three, two... now.
eight years.
face each other.
that is josh and dwight and jim.
i count it as a hobby.
uh, successful.
so... what are you doing?
sits.
so start hanging these all around the building.
but... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy.
please.
i know, it is okay.
and i do not think she is ever pooped in her life.
i wonder what is inside.
like a famous person once said, boys on the side.
had conversation with michael about taking credit for an idea that was not mine.
sears said, 'no'.
i am treating you the same as a man, for whom i would also not stand.
oh, okay.
look, i know that i screwed up in there.
oh, i see, so.
phyllis vance!
okay, jim, you are the number two in this office.
no!
you are an american classic.
no, he is not.
I will ask you a question.
pam's mom.
i could have done better.
are you a 12-year-old girl?
nothing really.
yeah.
there sat jim.
clams, snails... it is real slippery out here.
let us roll.
I am a little bit jealous, actually.
300 and one penny.
do not get a swelled head.
come on.
i had no idea when i got in that car and headed to new york i was going to quit.
oh my god.
oh, wow!
well, i hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at dunder mifflin, scranton.
okay.
i had a fish stick sandwich.
you ever cut tin before?
"ok" i can run it?
do not make me do this the hard way.
michael scott here.
okay, let us go over the plan again.
saleswoman has a vagina.
he would land on his feet.
it is not going to be tacky, deli platter food.
let us get real.
no cuts.
a man's life is in my hands.
by the time i get back to our floor, i will have decided.
what the hell are you doing here?
stop it now, god.
oh my god, that is three times as long as it takes me.
and I am not going to buy your stupid insurance.
so... oh, donna?
well, you did not even hear it.
you know what?
then i wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.
hey, you know, i do not know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya do not, we could hang out.
I will hold.
we got to see what he is got.
like who?
very ambitious.
hey.
and from what i hear, she is a slu- ah!
so you... god, we totally got you.
we have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
no, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
they just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
although i love this company more than almost anything in the world, i have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family.
taking an awfully long time.
so good!
so we have about an hour and a half.
you have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person.
i know what angela and the senator look like.
what do you need from me?
i guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you do not.
oh, my god.
okay.
the planet caprica.
letterman-style.
that i can not handle this job?
get, get them out.
but it has made some terrible decisions.
gay.
you know, that way i can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate... well i just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all... andy I am really sorry about your mother.
hi, linda.
uh, well I am afraid not.
no!
this is michael scott.
to change lives.
so, i am not a moron and i am just trying to help, you know?
I am going to be.
that is on a need-to-know basis.
and finally... no, no, no, no, wait.
mwah!
you are welcome.
i can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
thank you.
ohhhhh... why so you can do it?
where are you sitting?
are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
me no want to hear that, january because downsizing is a bitch.
they do not care.
i miss the old dunder mifflin.
give me the bottle!
I am calling security.
my stomach hurts, so i may be going home early today, but... well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it is probably psychological.
people who do not trust egg whites.
no!
do not say that.
because this is  really good, this is really good.
well... yeah, i know.
oh, jim.
thanks a lot, man.
mmm-hm-hmm.
athletes fought for silver medals.
yes.
I am very flattered.
shut.
idiot.

i know you said no questions, but... i have an early dinner that i need to get to... with the chief of police.
mose!
shut up.
um, headed out.
shaved off my goatee.
and today, both darryl and i took something.
sales is really not so hard ok?
wow.
hmm?
oh, you do not know?
I am not, do not rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.
I am sorry.
feed it.
pam, run a comb through your hair.
what is jazz hands?
let us go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?
if it is not stop and shop, i send it back.
well, that is a relief.
well you said that we could not make anymore stops, and i really had to go.
even if he does not, i would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway.
yes.
ok. he was in on it.
i know.
i have the long sleeve.
ah!
I am sleeping with pam's mom.
I am am not michael scott, i am dr. bergerstein.
pam?
does your husband have very soft erections?
okay... we can do this.
spoiler... alert.
and secondly, you need supply.
let us put it this way.
let us go sell some paper, buddy.
oh, pamcake.
you are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
um, yeah, it is a booze cruise, but it... there is more to the story than that.
okay, bye bye.
come on.
so, sexy is fun... hey, you know what?
I am in.
it is not fair.
well, it was love at first sight.
okay.
he is a good mechanic.
alright.
yeah, i took your purse.
ridiculous, angela.
hi.
um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
twice.
how is yoga?
what do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
so, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows.
because of him, the british left india, and then he became an actor like ronald reagan.
oh!
i just do not see a point in the dundies!
concierge marie.
mm-hmm.
use your imagination.
what have we here?
i had to use win/lose on that.
what happened to you people?
what is your 20?
and to moms.
but what are you doing?
oh, god.
what about my wish that we do not have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
good.
ok, is there a, an operating theater that is open to visitors?
you know what, let us just go to the dump, start looking - ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car - why?
when we were going out?
that is embarrassing.
because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
they just want to be told what to do.
well, the offer, dwight, was for one punch which i absorbed.
I have been raising children since i was a baby.
ok, you know something, dwight?
but boy, that erin.
let us see... i do not need $645; i already have $645, more or less.
i mean, we know we are going to start dating.
it is right here.
yes!
wow!
okay.
by the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I have forgotten about?
okay.
put your hands together for... mixed bread.
five citations and you are looking at a violation.
five minutes exactly.
in your perfect would, what would make this building awesome?
you will find love.
thank god, for everybody right?
and she needs to meet me right now.
you know what guys?
you hit pam in the face with a snowball while i watch.
whoo!
that is not why you lost.
if sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations.
oh, it is really cold here.
no, no, no.
i guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss.
hello.
let us take the dirt road off to the side.
dwight, they called your name.
pb and j, my mom's recipe!
okay, everyone!
none of your business.
does it stink?
listen, michael - about what happened earlier.
i have a girlfriend.
he does not need to sit, he is a traveling salesman.
every morning he would wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy.
oh, we did.
oh, it is just horrific.
I am a homeowner.
which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what i just did for dwight.
okay, how do you feel?
okay, give it to me.
crentist.
but when i do, we will have something to talk about.
questions?
oh, please.
yes, i will.
look at kelly and ryan.
ok. i do not care how your day was either, january i was just asking you because you asked me.
they are going great.
i mean, okay, we can do better.
same thing.
no no no the first part.
with a big idea.
um... i think we are under an hour still, so... i know.
he is a terrible salesman.
very official.
the foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
i got one.
lots to do, lots to do.
so you will do it?
have a seat.
okay.
what is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
I am going.
mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm.
that is very rude.
him or me?
my mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better.
wow.
for what?
okay.
yes!
lynn was as hot as erin.
all right, here we go!
oooh-ooh.
any messages?
i want that vice-presidency.

twenty-nine!
dunder mifflin, dwight schrute.
up-dog?
umm... alright.

you are a lion.
see, that is what I am having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle.
so that is it.
aw, man.
stop.
uh um... caw... caw... caw caw... caw... you know sometimes, to get perspective, i like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away.
delightful.
what have not you guessed?
boom boom boom boom!
no.
awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
mmm!
we would have to shut this place down for a week.
good.
that is what men say to each other, after a fight.
and i understand that you would want to just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
not offensive, because that is the way they talk in movies.
april 13th, 2002. that is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs.
that will damage ya.
i feel so good right now.
uh, stanley is having a stroke.
black bears can smell a salami at five miles michael, what are you thinking?!
why do not you get over lunch, oscar?
oh, this whole place used to be a brothel.
no, you are good.
uh, you know, he is not a member of the full staff so, uh, ryan you want to just step outside?
and vise-versa.
we will be here waiting for you.
somebody really got carried away with the spirit of christmas.
ok. i also have fallen into the fountain at the steamtown mall.
oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he is been fermenting since the day of my birth.
that is a piece of cake.
I am interviewing for a job at corporate.
my job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper.
jim carrey did not just walk in, ok. you can not see... you can not see my stomach.
conceptual!
this is her main source of money.
tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips... ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
answer over to the question.
never mind, i know it by heart.
night pam, thanks again for the rum.
shhh... just calm down.
oh, I am sorry.
two ladies at once.
jim?
think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen.
it is over.
you are pre-fired.
a dream team.
frank!
i do not want to have to read these tomorrow.
yeah.
i mean, you remember my idea for the fourth pirates movie.
how much do you charge?
michael!
what if the owner of prince family paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
how would that help creed?
i need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner.
think about it.
hey... why did you do it?
come on!
did you know that gay used to mean happy?
"here is something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.
stop, stop it!
let us do your performance review- ah, why, that is great news?
it is not a race.
a little over the top, do not you think?
sorry.
i would like an xbox, and a tv that is compatible with an xbox.
i do not think... you.. you are... my job sucks compared to this.
michael!
you know what?
okay, everybody listen up!
he poisoned me.
that is a distraction.
i do not want to offend anybody else.
if you want to just, anything?
by an alien life form.
that was it.
wha - that is, i hate her.
we work together.
walk with me.
you ready?
so, temp... you seem to be pretty close to this oscar.
but uh, you know what.
okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
you know, david.
going to the go go.
nice job on the cake, bozo!
or the funny things that they can do, like "where is the beef?"   yeah.
dwight?
guys, it was not my choice!
i had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency.
you know what?
all right.
here we go.
see?
let us take him-- let us go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
darryl is mista ra-jahs.
can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
if you said "I am sorry" in front of everybody.
why us?
at all.
oh, man.
oscar, what were you going to say?
that is strong!
duh, duh.
oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women?
ring it.
i can also see him proposing to oscar.
ha, ha!
which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis.
you know what, my job will be here when i get back.
wait, is this a joke?
it is bad.
i saw an ad on the sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division.
all of these things i have successfully managed.
i thought it might make me feel better.
this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
man!
fine.
stanley hudson and his mistress cynthia!
no, you are remembering it wrong.
you.
well, the only thing we are planting here is dead bodies.
... that i would have made.
i know.
what is going on?
i do not want that to happen to you guys.
wow, i am so sorry, i had no idea this party would be so lame.
i do not want to get into this debate again.
boom boom boom!
like trying to find the camera, to give the camera a look.
let us just speed this up, ok?
i do not have a knife!
um... everyone?
hey.
up and over.
well, they are just for guests.
oh, this was such a stupid idea!
that is a pun.
i thought that you were engaged?
um, oh, thinking about business school?
i rewarded dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
I am going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.
i believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters.
idiot, we are starting back up.
and uh, i just want to assure you, that i mean no disrespect.
thanks.
those glasses are super dark.
okay.
um, here is the deal.
first on the list, let us get you out of the car.
dwight schrute.
my hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump check it out good.
check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
you have seen it right?
get the window.
i love ladies, always have.
let us be professional, all right?
i get it.
no thank you, I will stick with my jerkie.
so, anybody else?
it is a punishment.
I am not answering it.
people!
i need you to perform a test.
oh, what a beautiful child.
i liked her jumpers.
they determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
actually, i do not care for meredith, but i do not believe in this kind of thing.
back off!
see, that is what christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, "man, i wish i got that." i mean, that is just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else.
that is the max.
i-i swear, nothing happened.
should we go?
so i saw you talking to wallace earlier.
maybe i do.
I am psyched you all made it.
so.
i can not believe it was you, either.
pam, would you care for a bagel?
get a room santas!
did you check its breathing?
a person did this.
ok, here are your character cards.
next year?
I am in no rush.
see this sign?
it is the witching hour!
I am not taking... I am not taking... wait a second, wait a second, i wrote it down in my diary.
wow!
i just remembered, so, I will just ride back with you.
i have some bad news.
excuse me.
with that i can buy... half the menu.
ah!
stop it.
dwight?
you greedy little thing.
jim, jim, do not, do not... no, i can do it.
please ja, ja... two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
stop ordering me around, jim!
good morning.
okay.
very good, very good.
addition by addition.
lovely.
it is michael.
well, I am one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... because pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at buckingham palace.
so let us make this the best dundies ever.
it is right in the middle of the paper belt.
yeah, that is actually a really good idea.
we do not do anything until michael gives us further instructions.
abraham lincoln once said that, "if you are a racist, i will attack you with the north." and those are the principles that i carry with me in the workplace.
yes.
no you did not, phyllis.
he is ruin... he is butchering it.
oh, ouch.
unless you like it.
but then you would not have me here.
boo, unimpressed.
just no guests.
c'mon.
now i can observe jim, trap jim, and destroy jim, just like in the bavarian fairy tale.
do not worry about me.
well, what should i do?
and he eats the same kind of paper i do.
speaking of which... may i have your attention please?
ohh, i enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I have learned so much from them.
no, hmmm... that is still... come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring.
you are the bait for toby?
you are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not?
i am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper.
awkward.
i want you to go in there.
no, I am serious.
so I am less funny than not funny at all?
so can you watch this?
yes.
it was a setup.
diversifying.
and i will let you know more as soon as i find out.
you want me to be happy?
okay?
i know the crap out of women.
if a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.
argh!!
and i wanted to apologize.
we had a foreign exchange student live with us when i was young.
you just did not think of it first.
this strappy young lad sitting here is phyllis' father, albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, are not you albert, hah?
besides, i like the cold.
kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
pick up the phone.
and that is not me being mean, dwight.
goodnight, jim.
i have been the third wheel so many times in my life.
uh, yeah, it is okay.
and i do not know why you downgraded what we had but i did not make us up.
that is true.
because you say the word please too much.
i have a very good feeling about it.
when, when i was talking to the fake tina fey?
you will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
she might be bluffing.
look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now.
I will talk to david.
you are so brave.
i miss pam.
ok, oscar, i do not need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
sure we do.
alright, good.
because i have, these memorization tricks that i use.
you give me your earpiece.
I am serious.
it is sad.
this is just what i needed.
why did you pick this place?
yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on pam.
and i will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me.
time to stop being polite and get real.
whoa.
arigatou gozaimashita.
hmm, hmm.
when i went to save the child, i saw meredith on the can."  gah.
that is because you are a preppy freak, you are the office pariah, and nobody likes you.
dwight, do not you have anything?
who are we going to... ryan.
i wish i could understand you.
i would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
let us see your penis.
try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?
is everything okay?
let us have happy times.
it is ironic is not it?
i love you!
i got the surgery, what else is there to do?
she needs a woman's touch.
i did not joke with any of them, i joked with you.
showtime.
do not try and think of a question to humor me.
and i grabbed this suit.
come on!
all work and no play makes michael a dull boy.
I am not asking the temp for an extension unless i really need it.
i did not, i did not know.
rodney dangerfield.
hello.
no spoilers.
see what i mean?
he is not the worst, okay?
you embarrassed me.
now I am going to have to go online and look at turtles or I will be off all day.
come here.
i had no idea that there would be a second punch.
untested.
i... i have essentially... i have essentially.
phhhht.
oh no, no, no.
oh, we are playing phone tag.
you are not getting my clients!
this is your last meal, so eat up.
walk with me.
you are?
you can count on me.
hot.
"which is you" is not a sentence.
name, meredith palmer.
bat!
it is jim, okay?
three, two, one.
just do not let him sit on you...  I am kidding.
wow.
you and me, michael.
and it is- yes!
hello david.
whatever you guys did earlier.
i wished for pam to gain courage.
it is perfect, thank you.
okay.
simple.
yes.
everybody's right.
good morning temp.
so we at sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
jim?
i do not want to blow this.
well, i just want to talk about what happened in there.
oh no, no.
I will go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
convicted rapist.
i was soft inside, there was something going on.
why do not we just, live and let live?
you are not stupid.
i have not signed them, ok?
sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.
snip snap!
you ever seen a suicide?"  and i jump.
thanks everybody.
oh, god.
yeah.
christmas card list.
and you know what else, i know you have got coverage under roy and i know that you wrote down those fake diseases.
how did we do it?
yes!
argh.
blah-di-blah!
yeah... uh, come in.
you could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.
very nice.
if oscar wants a donkey, let us get him one.
i am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning.
i know, dwight.
just get out!
no, no, no!
call poison control if you are bit by a spider.
took a little nap right next to jim's desk.
uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses." wow.
300 dollars.
you used lady on her back, did not you, you freak.
i felt really bad, because the pitcher was not able to play with his friends anymore.
a world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life.
where is he?
yeah.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
anything?
you will feel better after the 5k.
come here you.
hello!
have to think it through.
it is syracuse money.
alright, this is getting hot.
no, i am the team manager.
wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, jan-- hey!
men from scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
would you do the honors please?
because i would kick his ass.
people learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.
i have another complaint for jim's permanent file.
why do not you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what is your cell?
nice to meet you, bill.
angry.
do you?
we have been battling for a long time, but you know what?
hey!
wait, what girlfriend?
they need to be presented... royally... anyone?
why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
and he is going to fire me?
nellie's right.
stuff we all get.
and... okay.
i have cpr training.
no.
a shame to waste these.
the human being man's name was devon.
oh, thanks.
welcome to schrute farm.
no, no.
i know, I am sorry about that.
how is it goin?
what is the problem here?
i am talking about freedom, about choice.
i know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with hr.
for you... jerk.
i do not need your help.
each one is very different, like a snowflake.
i will have a chicken breast hold the chicken.
that is all, you did not mean it?
i just, i need to know a little bit more about my friend.
okay.
whoa!
if we do not do this to prince paper, someone else will.
i just did not inflate it all the way.
you did not need to do that.
although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one.
correction.
a bunch of guys, in a tent?
say-ber.
okay.
because i will.
oh really, I am sorry i thought this was a free country.
if she eats something the fetus does not like she is screwed.
okay?
do not think of it that way.
plus, you can eat your own hair.
hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par.
was she cute?
hi, i am michael scott, i am the captain of this party.
this is it.
hah!
i can not go back to that.
second only to the neck.
i do not know what I am grabbing here.
hi, jerry.
wait a minute!
...where did you get that information.
i do not know, it is just... i know.
surveillance, wire-tapping?
pepperoni.
...and that is the watch that you are going to wear?
it is just for family.
ach!
no.
i... really want to keep you.
she becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
that is how it is done.
do you like guns n' roses?
i got it, i got it.
you are kidding me.
and that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black.
please!
chuck it.
and so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, i would like to say that dunder mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.
okay- oh, jim.
go around and get his seatbelt.
well, do you think i should describe our filing system?
have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day.
unfortunately i am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
you have forfeited that privilege.
i do not either.
oh... oh, man!
does not apply.
that is impossible.
you are very... .
i have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.
stanley, phyllis.
how do i explain this to jan?
do not try to apologize to me, man!
there will be no leftovers.
they are not my favorite people in the world.
and everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.
my grandfather's name was dwight schrute.
no.
what is dunder mifflin?
stop it, stop it!
ok, i think, it might have been an inside consultant.
what did they do to you, angela?
so , here we are.
because of differeneces.
one more... question.
really.
kathy.
and elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.
it is really amazing.
yeah!
who am i?
okay.
and then when i actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show.
god.
do you really, tin man?
the uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version.
let us keep this rollin'... ryan?
it is a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
because a motel is dirty and it is sexy.
yeah.
he was here.
that is a joke.
messages?
well... oh, i... pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
that is it?
okay, actually, there is time to explain.
wait, wait, wait, come, i just, i just want to know why?
quiet you.
is that what we are going for now?
tell alan that the mets suck!
take me to robert.
get out jim.
show  them who is boss!
delta burke, i do declare.
alright.
pam, jim, kevin, stanley.
a thousand times more.
save yourself!
anybody making out in here?
what?!
okay.
time to make the donuts!
you are welcome, america.
no!
uh.
a man who has ruined all other men for you.
from dwight.
if you had any friends, you would understand.
ok. so, let us get it going.
i have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it.
here is another place.
ayyyy!
wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at jim's desk while he is away in philly.
like booze ever killed anybody.
all right, andy, please.
it is bad taste.
um, i am sort of a master of distraction.
it squeaks when you bang it, that is what she said.
you can get out of here.
this was no act of god.
"r" is among the most menacing of sounds.
trust me, stanley,  you are going to want to read this memo very carefully.
my sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .
table for four.
you know?
there is a massive conspiracy going on here, and i know you are involved.
this is important.
yes.
wow.
seven?
mornin'.
no, no, no... no, no... i do not like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
wait, why are we stopping?
hmm, i see, feisty.
you like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like... sales is and could be very, very cool.
she is a beaut!
um, easy.
remember, obesity awareness?
michael winslow, anyone?
okay, alright.
pussy.
i am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
oh, hey.
ahh.
wait a second.
i sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch.
ok. well, gosh.
you are right.
the rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
i want to see the baby.
him?
sounds fair to me, david.
I will see everyone upstairs.
because you guys are so... so important... to me.
i could... what do you mean, "what"?
nothing is going on.
hurry up, let us do this!
nooo!
is it the cash flow?
i mean, most people do not even know that a candy cane represents a shepherd's crook, which i assure you does not taste like peppermint.
in the other bed.
bloggers have halitosis.
when i was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how i was always able to distract others in class.
i do not know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
call the school, cancel.
why am i telling you my strategy?
yeah jim.
conference room five seconds!
is she ok?
what?
i just got out of surgery.
yes!
andy?
not necessarily.
no.
where does gayness come from?
company policy.
yeah.
pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
nice, huh?
people!
yes, but he does not want to know when, or whom.
actually, I am a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano.
harlem globetrotter... all right, time, time out.
wow, that sounds so... warm.
everybody's looking at you right now.
I am thinking roy?
following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going "please kitty, may i have some more?" you can not make this stuff up!
wallace said there would be one of those.
how may we help you?
hey dwight, he found it.
oh!
no way.
dwight.
all right, everybody, take a seat.
ok, good.
no.
oh, hey.
win win win.
what do i write under "reason for visit"?
do not leave us!
daraas!
yeah.
wow!
and i treat him well.
what?
um... i think i can do it.
no.
I will take a shirt.
yeah there is a volume knob on that thing.
that is enough.
she said it is the name of a viking princess.
michael.
that is too private." here is how it works.
or a toga, toga- toga!
boom, like this.
very excited?
pam, I am obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
more foot traffic.
and if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.
I am going to throw you this ball.
okay.
you think it was good?
come on!
dwight!
look at the numbers.
here we go.
there are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
yes.
ah, yes!
now.
watch this.
so you go in now, i am going to go in exactly ten minutes.
jim, you are 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, gumby has a better body than you.
it is your wedding.
whooo... wish i had my cell phone, but i left it inside.
come on.
it is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes.
hey, stanley.
hey i got this, okay?
they sit in big piles of garbage.
naaah.
four days ago.
was your dad a g.i.
which is half the people there.
very good, nice doing business with you.
both sad.
we are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.
maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.
pam is going to choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father.
burger king?
stand back!
i always have.
well, I am looking forward to meeting terri.
yeah, joke's on you buddy!
and get off my desk!
i think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
yo-da.
do you mind if i run out and get it?
we take separate cars.
mmm-hmm.
dwight told charles.
really?
yes, i can ride a bike.
okay?
what, huh?
what about a rabies nurse?
this is a white.
no, pam.
i like this chair.
you joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... they are adults, for god's sake.
that is right.
my guess?
really?
thank you angela, for reminding me.
i am serious.
if you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.
we are very excited about the merger with sabre.
ok, game on, man.
the loving union between people.
oh... oh no, not the huggy monster!
i got an offer that you can not refuse.
yup?
where is little man tate?
and carol came over.
you have always admired it.
there not going to downsize because i miss a lot of deadlines.
agreed.
shut up.
break it down by keyword, okay?
right on that black platform.
jim?
oh, oh, oh!
we are.
no office romances.
the chimney is in decent shape.
why is christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
yeah, but who put it here?
let us practice.
very well.
du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do.
you are better than my best.
and if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop.
filing?
wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is.
what is our topic?
did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I have ever gotten.
okay.
attention everyone, before i leave tomorrow i would like to reveal a secret i have kept for over twenty years.
excellent, good, good.
fine.
maybe!
nothing to be alarmed about.
did not do background checks of the warehouse guys.
i just feel like we have not talked in awhile.
let us take a look at what he is doing, everybody!
I am good.
picture a convict.
jim, michael's office.
i... am being replaced, as your leader, by dwight.
your perspective was very useful.
your call, b. nice.
well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you did not mean, um, and that i forgive you for.
which brings me to my main point and that is that i will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.
you did not, but... it will be fine.
the electric city.
nah.
dun-der... dun-der.
okay.
we were joking around.
how strange.
so, why did you and karen break up?
okay.
surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
phyllis, you want to give it a shot?

i do not know why.
in an election year.
con- you unzip your pants, and you find that there is a calculator down there.
i can not even look at her without thinking about it ending.
please, do not want to spoil it for anybody.
and it is part of my job, but... blah!
the ship is sinking!
"it is ryan the wuphf guy!" "he is up there." look at that!
when he gets a good hand, he coughs.
unless you are still sick.

i am going to scare these kids so bad.
women really go for that crap.
this might get ugly.
i do understand it.

it happens to the best of us.
they will melt right into your flesh!
so suck on that!
terrific.
the target- it is oscar, is not it?
he wrapped his belt around his own neck.
that is what she said.
macadamias, brazil nuts, pecans, almonds.
actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
best day ever.
i lost everybody's jobs.
what else does it look like?
it is a fake wheel, dummy.
but we are going to be working pretty hard until five pm.
yes.
i thought you guys could not come.
may i?
if i can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, i ought to be able to cut my -- these are not dolls, jim.
well, jim may be lying with his words, but he can not lie with his body.
so we are starting with account setup- okay, can i have that?
why not do it now?
raise your cups on high.
his name's andy.
pam, really, what is it?
let us get this movin'.
i had fish yesterday.

I am not overwhelmed, pam.
oh, man.
eh.
highways or surface roads?
I am going to go in there and tell her that we can not be together.
okay, darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture.
detonator where?

wow!
our pentagon.

these people are my friends and i care about them!
yeah.
man.
I am good with bosses.
look at where you are going to be doing the cartwheel.
you told me, that i lead a... cushy, wimpy, nerf life.
so you would think that is a good idea for me to do?
no, dwight, we were robbed.
try zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
so no?
um, sure, i will get you the best iced tea in the world.
hey, doc?
what did i miss?
oh, did not!
can you tell andy to focus on the springs?
it keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat.
meetings.
dwight, please, please.
in fact, there are many knots that i cannot untie.
i do not know.
yes!
so if i was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield- i would not be asking you lightly, now would i?
go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
this is going to sound weird, but i think i may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole pam situation.
classy.
yes.
do you even know what this is?
possibly filipino.
"a particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute--" yes.
welcome to my convenience store.
wowweee.

my gift to you.
yeah.
hey, buttercup.

i went medieval on his heinie.
in monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.

well that is... because... i am a genius.
yeah, perfectly mediocre.
$49 per month.
could i be a part of the meeting also?
and that is the point, right?
deliciousity.
you are scared, but now you are ready to learn.
phyllis.
part of my busy day, you know.
this does not seem like a very big operation.
namaste.
dwight...  you just keep your eyes on the road.
yes.
hmmm... ok, well, it is after five.
i loved my father very much.
arigatou.
nice.

nyeh, i work here.
good morning.
it is nice to see you.
dwight, not now, we have been robbed.
if you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
good.
okay.
I am going to give him mouth to mouth.
jim!
oh, yeah.
i do not like him either.
that is correct.
come on people, let us get  them in.
oh my god, oh my god, no, no, no.
hell no!

jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.
medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
i do kickboxing three times a week.
that is not his fault!
where is the nurse?
we will find another way, we will ask power-point.
okay, you know what?
so, uh, corporate just said that i do not want to... oh, thank you.
i had not planned on including him.
ok. first test.
great.
probably will not.
"too soon for arabs." maybe next year.
this not knowing, that is what is killing me.
hey!
i think you are right.
hey goldenface.
bob, how old are you?
with all the feeling to base a show around.
jim, you are in charge of the vacation schedule now.
you are coming, and that is an order.
i do not remember in which direction.
what i want to do right now is try something a little different.
that was great, she gets it!
i found twins.
you know what?
funny story: the way that i got into improv was, i got into improv.
all the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
phyllis is like our mrs. butterworth.
ehhhh....
dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while i talk to helene?
okay.
now let us go over membership.
how did you know i was up here?
sometimes I will start a sentence, and i do not even know where it is going.
ok. that is to broad.
and they would rather be in the hole.
the press wants a story, i will give them a story.
pam, I will help you.
made a few friends.
no no, he is doing it to catch the president!
it hit the rim.
what?
and another thing.
it says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for dow chemical.
can you make that straighter?
pam.
that is amazing.
it is now or never!
oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
sorry.
ring it!
you might remember testing my urine a few years back when i was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
i emailed joe.
that jim is also a friend of mine, and i would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.
i buy them from discount stores... or on ebay.
would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?
come on.
what the- ugh.
leben ist dort alt, alter als die baume, junger als die berge, wie eine brise blasend take it andy!
i sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.
my actual mother was very cold and distant.
this is dwight schrute.
so, uh, so what is the vibe?
yes, that is a good idea.
how is that funny?
what?
good.
well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me mr. scott.
for 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher.
thanks.

the point is, do not listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
where?
dwight schrute, assistant regional manager, dunder-mifflin.
why would we do that?
unless he comes back as pretend dwight.
unfortunately i spoke to oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
believe it.
okay, that is enough.
i also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what- heeded- when no one hedded- n-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
I am michael scott.
you are a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.
believe me its nothing.
I am right in your crack!
you forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you are locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
oh, hey, ebenezer, boink.
you guys got it soft, and cushy!
have not you seen ghostbusters, pam?
and you know what?
if that idiot ever gets here.
so, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.

maybe wee find some wiggle room?
now all off a sudden he is cinderella of the office.

wow!
thank you.
do you understand?
oh.
you are wearing loafers!
- and to king meredith!
i do not want you to treat him like anyone else in the office.
that is actually not a good example, because i have been compared to a young paul newman, my eyes and my face.
pam, could you put jan on, please?
i am off!
no, no, no, no.
you know what, we will postpone this party until then.

the parties.
i was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual.

I am right here, I am right here.

it is for your trouble.
ignore him.
that is hilarious.

major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative.

let us go!
wait!
oh, my god, dwight.
hey!
ah.

you have not even looked around yet.
it feeds my soul.
schrute sperm are strong,  but they are no match for a grown schrute man.

that is how it works.
the proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.

hey uh, question for you.
someone else.

when you got transferred, and i drove you up to nashua, you said, "michael, i love you, but i can not do this." but then, with this other guy, you do not have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you?
can i use it?
what happened?
I have got a treat for you!
that is the sanest thing I have ever heard.

pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in tallahassee, florida where I am going to be living for the next three weeks.
what?
it is like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away.
life.
the doctor says, there is no way i can operate on this boy, ... a man is found hanging from the ceiling... a hunter.
it is going to be the happiest day of my life.
could oscar and angela be having a gay affair?

or the front of the bus.
well, do not put words in my mouth.
all right.
what is that thing that dwight always says?
bye michael!
baby carrots.
but you can not just go right to the selling, you need "small talk."  what topics can you use for small talk?
i do not have a reservation but i want a room in the halpert-beesly block of rooms.
when will she be ready?
robert dunder everybody.
oh, we will.

that was really good.
so it does.
I am ready to go and I am callin' shotgun.
um, i just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I am sorry.
having luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. the last time i saw luke was the opening day of 'ace ventura ii' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot.
i just have a different life style.
i love it!
i have.
dwight, you ignorant slut.
90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.

i do not know.
i was a bad ass mo-fo.
everybody!
yes, thanks, fantastic sam's.
like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.
michael... i promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over.
this is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.
yeah.

i am a farmer angela.
there is another side to this place, gentleman.
here we go.

no.
okay.
yes, you do.
oh!
i did say i would, but i was wrong.

I would love to take a look around.
and i have a personality, where as you...  yes, andy?
do not even think.
to find a kid he liked better.
here we go.

back injuries are common.
adios!
a lot better than i did earlier.
think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on tv, or in movies, or in real life?
we already have a buyer.
"michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the cfo, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company.
they are awesome.
box seats as usual.
oh honey, i have the best trophy right here, aside from my dundies.
hello, mr. buttlicker.
question?
you were right jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.

that is good.
well, that is good, he still has a sense of humor.
you stupid son of a bitch.
one of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.
we are reaaallly mooovin' now!
uh, you are foir-ed." it just makes people sad, and an office can not function that way.
and i made a bit of a judgment call.
oh do not go.
alright.
no, you will be tested.
you either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.
ryan's next.
i want you to know that you are beautiful.
'kay.
um... that is it!
oh, yes yes yes yes.
he is alive.
now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.

so... holly's my family now.
this is not at drill!
and you make sure to get down there and check out that harry potter world.

ha!
everything here was made in china, pam.
I will be baaaaack!
what do you have in mind?

hey, hey, hey.
wow.
ok, umm, could i just have a frosty and a baked potato please?

hot, tasty.
excellent!
if you lay a finger... would you look at that?
an intense pressure like I would never felt before.
do you know what this is for?
but it is great that you do not, because i am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I am - I will be honest, I am having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of  them.
and they will get a mini-fridge compliments of vance refrigeration.
and if i thought you were terrible, i would have booed.
I am just going to reschedule for next week.
yeah, i know.
oh, sh... I am sorry angela.
and i have decided with that money i am going to buy a new, drum roll please...  can anybody guess?
i do not want to talk about that.

I am sorry, i can not control him.
call it a one of everything.
frankly, you have a job because ryan and pam are starting with us as salesmen.
you follow that guy to the people who is really really bad.
ok!
phyllis, did i or did i not say fruit?
it will be a pleasure doing business with you.
oh, man.
not everyone took one.

i just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when i make a sale.
there were.
no, no, we are going to leave jan out of this.

open the trunk.
do not listen to her.
ok, karen, ryan, pam, center stage.
cup of soup's a good idea though.
jo, jo, i can assure you it was no one in this office.
you would have to fire him, right?
you make that yourself?
you have stress?
jim!

she claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
it is a miracle.
this is dwight, by the way.
we will do this.
you know what, we do not have to deal with this.
how is that better than an ipod?
no way.
can we have another?
i recognize that.
once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we have overcome our differences.
hell, yeah.
did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
probably get on pam.
swish, swish, swish.

yes?
minutes from previous meeting of knights of the night.
unbelievable!
business school.
welcome!

it is a perfect situation for me.
i cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid.

and the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.
thank you, michael.
we have not even started this horrible process of... okay, creed.

it is not even to "y".
i wanted to ask your permission to ask out katy.
the camera?
i do not need your help!
it is certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so... ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time.
killing my hand, there.
you will figure it out.
wait, this is not our floor.
there is one other thing and this is important.
please give me it.
rumors.
so this is astird.

pam, let us go.
nathan ford's arm looks pretty strong.
do you know, um, "goodbye stranger"?
hi santa.
with sex!
holly's favorite.
pretty disgusting.
is this it?
i will bring it on.
no, no no.
look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
it was awesome.
it is beet vodka and it is delicious.
so we will have an onion loaf for the table, please.
now, no one was there in the wine cellar.
i know, i know, i know, i would not be offering it if i did not think you could handle it.
yeah, that would be amazing.
in the morning the cops come and i escape in one of their uniforms.
meredith will do ok. be assured this day will come.
you are all my homies you down with the dundies?
impossible to say.
you have a stockholder meeting coming up and you are going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.
stanley.
i basically decorated my condo for free with all of my swag.
one more bite of eclair each.
what?
and he is like no, i like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
meredith is fired.
and in the future, if i want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, i will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
yeah, what?
and to think, i always thought of her as a second meredith.
when?
kelly, you are hindu, so you believe in buddha.
why do not you bring by your little angel?
I am trying to make him feel important.
final walkthrough.
look, are you jealous of him?
or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother.
jefferson.
we can not have workers going straight to corporate.
what am i doing?
so then you will not mind if tonight i just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh.
there is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman.
angela, stanley, oscar, meredith, phyllis, kevin, creed.
I will give you five bucks for it.
what are you guys talking about?
but if you are ever in the area, you will always have a place to stay...in my barn.
no- no i am not.
i know.
mr. schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk.
keep the change.
mm-hmm.
hey, can i play?
if i wanted to hit you, i would have hit you.
but 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if i can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba - really?
what... all your friends are going to be there.
it is a uniform and i turned it in today when i tendered my resignation.
and he is leaving a trail of poops?
they are awesome.
words will never be enough.
they are like the golden globes but less mean.
okay.
yeah!
nice try, josh!
oh, that is different, is it?
andy, cornell called, they think you suck.
aaaaaaaa!
how much does it hurt?
so, i let them out first, i have a lawsuit on my hands.
really?
when the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
give-okay.
today, ryan is ethan hawke, and i am the african-american.
i do not want natural!
because she is a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.
well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.
ah, la, la, la.
this office, i think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it is probably more advanced than you are used to.
bring it.
when... is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
ready!
sorry, I am going into a meeting right now.
very comedically humorous jim.
you people do not realize what you are asking.
no this is holly.
i do not understand what he is saying.
yeah!
i had to send him home.
why do not you look over some of our materials?
professor copperfield's miracle legumes?
undefeated season.
it is ok. watch it.
here is to mr. iacocca and his failed experiment, the de lorean.
not what i asked.
all right.
come on!
ah, that is nice.
offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it is a good chair.
without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it is barely three pounds.
if onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be erntedankfest.
but i promise I will never betray you again.
you know who that is?
mmmhmm.
oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
carol.
and if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his.
he is doing just fine.
no.
yeah, nothing.
and you did not call jim - that seems significant.
ah, yes.
oh, pam with the dirty talk.
okay, okay.
i like to stay tight.
so, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the mcdreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he is in love with her... really?
thank you.
why is there a door close button if it does not even close the door?
come on, man?
oh, you know, i did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
yeah!
come on!
ugh... all right.
not really!
stephanie could you hop off please?
what are you talking about- forget that.
meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that is sort of a repair.
mmmhmmm.
a robot.
i chose my words very carefully.
did you see that?
is it?
did you know that in morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time?
the guy who had my job has died.
you know, it is not easy getting excited about stuff.
and i consider myself a great philanderer.
sorry, rolf goes first.
no, that is not... i do not know what that is.
i did not even invite you to my birthday party.
now these are limes, lemons, onions... oh, yuck.
so... hey come on, do not be sad, just... ok... just.
poor hornet.
the three stooges.
i want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine.
ok. ok. hey.
it is the end of the month, and i was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.
yes, hello mr. flax this is michael scott, your daughter's boss.
it is already been stolen this round.
yes, she was.
yeah.
okay, phyllis.
better than that.
instead, today i will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
no... ok, she always looks like that... that is not my fault.
and i hope that we can still be friends.
i can not wait to do to pam, what i just did... to pam.
you are going to like this.
how much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership?
is that what you are saying?
jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble.
oh ho hokay.
this is where we first kissed.
I am the man for this job.
if we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
are you serious?
who is going?
you forgetting something?
how?
I am not giving you the answer.
there are certain defining moments in a person's life.
a pact.
damn it!
ohh.. can not you?
named for the good times you have when you are in it.
or worse!
just... let us do it!
that is what i hate bittersweet chocolate.
I am going to have to cut this all out.
ummm.
we ought to have this thing serviced.
you know what is?
no more meetings this week.
i know what a flounder is.
and i like to pack heavy.
why do not you just cool it, okay?
you know, just a little bit of money.
i really can not say.
you know what we should do?
i have not gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.
meredith, you have slept with so many guys you are starting to look like one.
oh, well, thank you jim.
if you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
pam... paaam!?
i think she is efficient.
come here please.
huh.
i do not know.
the very next day i went out and i scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team.
i do not want dwight.
racka do do dee do-do do-do!
no, do not just let her eat the grass, she will puke it right up.
no, I am an inland.
or is it "shmear?" like the cream cheese.
it is not a jodie foster afternoon without little man tate, buddy.
put my heart out there.
will you just give us a second?
gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
it is going to work very smoothly, because pam and ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from michael scott paper company and- no, you lost those clients.
ah.
no, no!
he needs me.
no, you can not.
deal with it!
and if a friend can not make you feel good, then i do not want any friends.
phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
he scores.
oh, nothing much.
i got us talking.
yes.
that is not how business works, okay?
and you know what?
three squeezes and i would drain you.
i feel like neve campbell in sream ii.
do you hear that?
however, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs.
nice!
oh... that is going to change.
cancel card.
yes.
really?
do not try to flirt your way into this.
what do you do?
wow!
that is cool.
mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
well, do not bother quitting because you are fired.
no.
you could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
but it is not... going to take... a week or two.
ha!
you are so smart.
just, you never know.
i will finish that later.
pa rum pump um pum whassup!
i have my book on business, somehow i manage.
you just do not think i am capable, of making a difference.
happy birthday to creed.
i can not stop.
so what you are saying is you kind of like it?
you want one of your own?
you me!
i read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever.
ha!
well, what should i do, guys?
all right girls break it up, you are being infiltrated.
here, let me... just cover up that bald patch.
the precious heart.
he has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder.
uh... um, i think you will have fun.
brrring.
game on!
you think i framed you, and you are worried about the taxpayer?
a net?
all good.
thank god.
never ever, ever sleep with your boss.
meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds.
no doy!
it is the most sacred and honored hindu holiday in the world.
i can not use phyllis.
because i guess I am the only aphrodisiac she needs.
look at these people.
yeah, no.
someone else shoots and i take the ball and i score.
everybody?
these things sell themselves.
no... that can not be it.
no, no, no!
why do not you walk away from the room, 'kay?
your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
no.
wow.
okay.
hello?
kelly, look at me!
something from the heart.
that was a different guy.
and now, the chains.
but i need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
did you hear about the fight?
sign it!
they stopped making plaques that year.
the choice is yours.
and without denying the seriousness of the situation, i would just like to remind you that in much of the netherlands, swimming naked is the norm.
I am sorry.
all the way down.
go to my car.
cons.
you know, there is no easy way to do this.
oh here he is!
what does that mean?
great.
toby's going away!
ryan... has never made a sale.
i framed a raccoon for opening a christmas present.
thought so too.
stop the bus, okay?
from the greek phila meaning "love," and adelph, meaning "adolf." "the city that loves adolf." good luck with your new enterprise and do not wear the blue striped shirt.
good.
good guy.
you guys could double date.
i just do not know.
michael, that is absurd.
well, we will fix it up.
okay.
okay, she needs to be serviced.
huh?
uh-oh.
she does not need an internet presence, you just know.
ok, i accept it.
do you think you can handle it?
no, I am always good... for some serious buckage.
okay, everybody, shh!
come over here!
make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
so how did you deal with people not liking you?
you have got to be -ing kidding me.
it is all good stuff.
remembering the dead does not help anybody.
dwight, find out what the present is.
well, i have a late birthday and usually september's a cut-off point.
guilty!
okay.
um... i wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union.
have i ever lied to you?
giggle-giggle, juji-juji, i get it, i get it.
accounting?
yes.
boom!
you are cured.
what are you talking about?
what is wrong?
and maybe you should cry.
i want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a mtv on crack kind of thing.
and when i have curried favor with her, i will let you know.
so, what is the scuttlebutt?
i... okay, okay, okay,  alright, thank you.
this will only up my game.
i was just going to...  i was going to talk to holly, about her hygiene.
thank you.
damn it.
you do something to me that i can not explain.
how did you push away the bad thoughts?
what is that?
we are going to ... i just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world.
so would you guys like some lemonade?
now it is done.
300 dollars do i hear 300 dollars?
that is unfortunate.
i can not wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife.
texas!
ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?
what is the exact square footage.
i just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends.
barbeque at jim's tonight.
but ed truck can not because he is-- dead.
jim!
and secondly, phyllis how are those mittens coming?
awww!
now, if michael had studied the spidey principles that I would drawn up for him, jan's boobs might not be all over the internet.
just kidding, not yet anyway.
i know how it happened.
oil can.
okay, i have served you loyally for years.
derrick, and lefevre, and ben, and ayana, and mikela, and nikki and jason, and... I am sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?
phyllis!
yes it is.
i will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something.
and she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that i have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.
operation surprise.
you did.
what?
you can trust that i am telling you the truth.
yes, no, why?
cancel all of your business with the steamtown mall!
i have a deposit.
gryffindor!
I am telling you, they are heartbreaking too.
and I have been drinking.
pam has ceased caring.
kevin, in sumo culture, you would be considered a promising up and comer.
let us do this!
okay, alright, okay, it is time.
sorry.
but, clearly, they make it work.
this is uh, concierge marie... ...who works at our hotel.
it could be my race, could be the fact that I am so fit, or I am a womanizer... fair game.
quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure.
centerfold in the catholic schoolgirl's outfit?
I am studying with the master, huh?
oh, no, no.
i can not believe I am actually doing this!
i want to come to work.
what does the female vagina look like?
you want to come up and sing this one?
he is like the lone ranger, and I am like tonto.
any questions?
good, it is good.
hold on michael!
dead.
what can i do?
it tastes like sheep feces.
that is not true.
they were so happy down there.
just... eat it.
thank you very much, everybody.
no, no.
but no one can become me.
the power source.
i can not do anything about it, i can not... you know.
look, prison stinks, is what I am saying.
hey come with me.
i listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
carol?
they say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office.
dwight, no.
i do.
no, you are not.
i have roy.
have you never been to a quaker fair before?
that is all you need.
bono.
there is no way he has not strangled at least one stripper.
arrrgggh!
because today, is the day that jim and pam become one.
you can toss them.
for those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs.
some people need dozens of friends to say, "hey, look at me, I am popular." but not me.
you are a good man.
do not.
and a panther.
pam, say hi.
what are we going to do with all that bonus money, henrietta?
here he comes!
that is not a statue, that is a robot.
there.
we have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
ok, if he is not down by four, I will get the papers up to him.
this is him: "hey!
oh, that is my last one.
oh hahahaha.
i just need some alone time.
uh oh, up to the nose.
in your face!
i present the orientation video.
whoa, whoa.
maybe, i have not decided yet.
there we go.
i do not tell michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.
he did.
the liar will perspire.
not really.
"i feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business." yeah.
no.
hi.
do not get revenge on me, nerd.
what?
"seasonal." well, the christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical.
a few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
okay, you know what toby?
we already put a call into them, robert.
he has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that?
ok. tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, kelly, has invited us all to a diwali celebration put on by her community.
no one just called you.
cover your nose and mouth.
luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup.
you do not try tactic number eight on me.
no, he is a little... little dim.
my guts and my heart, and while i eventually puked my guts out, i never puked my heart out.
dwight, do not!
all right!
esther's on her way up.
we sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that.
oh.
eat it!
okay, everybody, let us take this next hill.
yeah?
okay, are you cool, really?
are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
just relax, ok?
right?
we always invited them.
did anyone look each other in the eye?
start pretending to do work."  what a jerk.
this woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink.
he uh, guh recently, right?
so... thank you very much.
they are worn down.
i have to go to practice.
and then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
they are mean, but they are incisive.
like i was watching cinemax last weekend.
oh, okay.
i like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.
that makes sense because he has elfish features.
... ... you are welcome.
you are welcome, you are welcome.
taking care of business.
still have my job in scranton, though.
i love it!
well, i can not afford it, and corporate will not pay for it.
yeah!
good.
good.
i love it!
apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.
take that thing off the table!
you know what?
you know.
hey, everybody, listen up.
play it again.
really?
muh.
yeah, when I am ready, mike.
come on!
no.
thankfully.
now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
so let us just go with mine.
april 13th, 2002. i barge because i care.
to our boss!
and this is, do not tell me, martin... ne... ne...nack.
i do not want to move desks!
oh, just... hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey it guy.
erin, i am so glad that you trusted me.
but that is my name.
home, sweet home.
and, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when i was born.
but you need to decide; otherwise I am taking the bonus.
she walks out.
like i sold you on the idea that my father had died.
i do not know that there is anything left for us to talk about, esther.
because, i will.
okay.
you are right.
relax.
ah!
it feels so good to finally say that out loud.
cutie-pie.
this is why i do it, that is what i have to come home to.
yeah.
you could be the indian bill gates.
and this... is meredith's card.
it just found you!
that is all sir, you may go.
oh my god!
um?
there is no name listed.
five yards in and your forearms will be on fire.
creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel?
not at all.
you can just owe me.
the point is, they are not unhappy anymore.
huh, math, that is not so hard.
yeah.
cage match!
oh, after you.
yeah.
bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!
look- oh my god... what do you want dwight?
that is not a very nice thing to say about him.
step up.
did she spurn your advances?
I will never outsell jim and pam without one.
ok, you know what?
bring him the gabba-gool!
and then packer did both of them.
a celebration of oscar.
no, just get me a case.
what is the matter... haaaww!
it is amazing.
is anybody home?
that way you can see what it looks like when you are up here.
i need you.
cool, cool.
in your face!
wow, like kevin, rating the best bars in scranton?
well, then that is your stereotype, not mine.
drop that sucker.
just read from- just read the cards.
and the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother.
i got it.
their suffering.
i need silence or sam kinison to prepare.
I am a big believer in people being here more.
she is single now.
no, it is an accountability booster.
who needs a new tractor anyway?
no you are not.
yeah.
shall i play for you?
well then... i am glad you are ok. business is like a jungle.
no, but that is sometimes part of it.
last weekend i outran a black pepper snake.
nobody likes to be flashed.
mr. brown, if that was his real name.
I am suspicious of this because i had the exact same idea, for catching osama bin laden.
you want to help us out with that?... stanley, earth to stanley... yes you.
that does not make any sense.
rule two: we stop at nothing.
cornell.
really?
so you are from des moines?
that is, whatever stupid show you want- to watch tonight we are watching it.
he is not just here for the coffee, jim.
that... that is impossible.
there is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any sabre printers.
so why did not you add it to the res... ?
what was that?
no.
there is a big, big future in that.
we need to find out what is blocking you.
thank you, angela.
well... that is not... that is not what...no, no, I am not saying that, that is disgusting.
by now you are probably sick of hearing about dunder mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.
ryan, ryan, we are going to take your clothes off.
as if you had a choice.
comparisons are hard.
just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.
i want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office.
I am filled with good ideas.
you forged them!
I would like to see a big smile.
how can he still not know?
yeah, no... you know what.
the bubble wrap is the only thing that is stopping his suit from getting wrinkled.
right.
right?
for kelly, that seems a bit much.
yeah.
that is politics baby.
too personal.
although that will change.
people say, "oh, it is dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place." well i say, "it is better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose." do i believe that michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment?
great.
i have snow tires and chains.
i know, i know.
do not know, do not care.
and that is not because he is black.
pam?
yes, sure they do, dwight.
and his southern italian heritage raises some flags.
good.
and welcome to c.r.i.m.e.-a.i.d.
no.
we have three rooms, each with a different theme.
hey toby.
hello!
oh.
okay.
you are cheating.
I am not sure, um, mountainton?
um, did you do the thing i asked you to do about the magazines?
angela, you are mrs. howell.
i had congress with angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins.
well, i can see andy proposing to angela.
I am not going to slam you up against the wall.
try my googi, googi.
oh ho, the look on your faces!
cookie.
I will take it from here.
i am so sorry that phyllis hates you.
no you are not.
what is jim capable of... or pam... or kevin?
okay, so no salami in the pants.
reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets.
if there are any left over, you can buy one later.
hello?
so...yes.
and, you want to take that away from me?
a pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
is that a contradiction?
but you know what?
pam!
the it tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
i do not know that first things about secret meetings.
at home?
not if the printer is not hooked up.
so, while she is here i am going to be acting kind of cold to you.
oh, hey, guys.
"interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process." "interviewer has suspect motives." "interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior dartmouth." ever heard of it?
michael always said, k.i.s.s.
i just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen.
do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody?
ah!
i did wave.
oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation.
ok, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk do not have the stomach to do.
thanks for acknowledging that.
that is a great question, erin.
your back core, your arm core, the marine core actually uses it.
my proudest moment here was not when i increased profits by 17% or when i cut expenses without losing a single employee.
shame on you.
it is a trick question.
dwight, is that a meat sandwich?
arrggh.
d-w-i-g-h-t. ok, you know what?
three.
ah!
all right.
sometimes i feel like they are raising us.
kgb.
okay, i will... I am not feeling very well right now though.
that is not how you go camping.
hey, does sasha have a godfather, because i... oh... kay.
ah yeah!
is it a living organism?
your enthusiasm's turning people off.
you wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the fonz?
where are all the hot people?
what is iiiit?
just sign your name below.
tomorrow i want everyone to have a good time.
you said to just... okay, I am on it!
told it.
come on in.
i can tell.
you set a date?
what?
packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, andy.
hustle!
um, no, not... no.
hey, is that healthy food?
merry christmas.
and this is before i had even heard of one, or seen one.
that does not make any sense.
ohh.
wohahah!
oh do not.
good.
dwight.
i left him all the tools he needs.
oh, pam.
where?
I am getting a stitch.
congratulations.
hi.
holly, this is not ocean's eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and do not care about how it turns out.
not america is number two.
are you kidding me?
the worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
that is the life.
you put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.
the show's not over.
okay geniuses, how would you do it?

the decision to turn on michael was difficult.
it is always a treat when <i>our</i> paths cross.

dun-der.
it is not your business, dwight.
high test, or unleaded?
what is it?
wait, what is this?
you know what jim, there are two santas in the room.
somebody has been talking in bed.
i can not force you to go down but i can entice you.
yes.
i have it on good authority that you said the following.

worse than that.
call you immediately.
except driving.
okay.
no.
if you choose to accept this mission...wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.

just a wet blanket named pam.
yes.
dwight?
it is really technically proficient but really there is no heart or soul in it.
probably did not want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.
it will cure all of your "gee i do not know if michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "i do not really see them together".
come-on... come on, come on.
it is not a jewish joke, so do not worry.
go home, toby.
and that happened.

i do not say "hi" pam!
jim leave us.
if you steal a thousand post-it notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you have made a profit... margin.

scranton!

it is been four months since i was with holly, and she was way hotter then stacy.
when i said that i wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did i do?

i... i did not do that.
wow.
let us go.
why do not we... pump some iron?
the guy, i think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... i, well, the melon baller was my idea.
yes!
i crawled home.
the way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again.
oh, do not worry.
good night vikram.

except i could fly.
jim is her husband.
also, i want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother does not acknowledge my paternity.
and I am hot, I am so hot.
and then it is like all regret.
because justice never rests.
this week we are rolling out the brand new sabre tablet....the pyramid.
try not to draw attention, please.
actually you were the other woman so... is that why your wearing makeup today?
the man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
i really do not think so.
no dwight, not everything is a threat.
come on down here.
only if he fails.
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

what..ooh, mose.
and i want you to know that anything and everything can be said.
she is got - i do not know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
okay, that is your idea?
bond.
you had to, what other choice did you have?
oh, oh!
everyone thinks the new guys are so cool because they can slack line.
what box?!

shhh... shut it!
hello.

hey.
ok. the reason that i got bad customer reviews is because i did not!
come on, stanley let us go.
head table, where i belong.
they did not eat the children.
to understand me, you have to know that i work in the city, but i live here on this small, beautiful farm.
so it is not exactly like 'highlander,' but still... i would like to arrange a truce.
good job.
we are already in the city.
how dare you!
why do not you, ah, show them some of your bling.
ah!
stop it!
okay.
you know what?
here we go!
42897.  ok. pam, could i see you in my office?

maybe.
okay, fine.
last one down is a rotten egg.
i do not even know how to say this, but cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. and that is not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
how rude!
a lot of pressure.
it was not a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
um... martin, from stamford, was, at one time, in prison.
all right, ok. i love babies.
woooo!
forget it.
happy birthday!
pass.
the door to my shelter.
anyone.
what is going on?
no, no, no.
i want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
I will, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.
why?
i can not even imagine how painful this must be for you.
and if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, i understand.
you ever been in a manager's office before?

heh heh heh!
so, dwight, you uh, have the east german gal.
I will approve the overages.
that was a very good point.

i do not want to die!
wow.

I am going to be thinking about how many friends i have, and my children, and my comedy albums.
it is mother nature.
jim, great real.
throw it.
huh-  does she ever talk about me?
good to see you again.
one must wrestle fear to the ground.
why?
a. dear.
and superior brain power.
i want you to write down everything that people are doing all day.
well, yeah.
autumn was what i was going to say.
i thought i understood women, but maybe, can not believe I am going to say this, maybe, women do not understand themselves.
everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.
three words or less.
fire andy.
i put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter.
ooh, someone is freakin'.
I will just wave and introduce myself.
yes.
okay.
so, take it away, toby!
wait, wait.
i really do.
I have moved on.
get it out.
what are you doing..?
here, tell us your war stories.
that is fantastic.

well, pam and i have eloped.
stanley!
what?
have you seen that video?
ok?
that is obvious.
happy bird-day.
fire you?
so which way are you leaning?
you get to look at her.

brr brr brr brr  and i, dwight schrute, am in charge of the entire operation.
you are the silent killer.
we are not done.
alright stop, stop making him say it!
no way, no how.
wanted to get him oh the places you will go, but they were sold out.
an age or month?
silence.
we are all going to go and we are going to have a good time.
stanley, how do we combat him?
party's over?
was i saying anything interesting?
next stop is helene.
that does not sound crazy, jim.
i do not have to buy it.
david.
you did not just say that!
so suck it.
i can hear and see everything.
one?
he is tall and yellow and very nice.
schrute comma dwight.
do people respect him?
the name is bond... santa bond.
pow!
i do not know.
welcome.
all right!
well, you have... ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have... ...and i am very proud of being a narc.
you need to start over.
it was a crime of passion, jan, not a disgruntled employee.
we tried and we failed.
watch this part, okay?
oh... yeah... ugh.
spider-man.
who is next?
the sales department smashed my sandwich.
and that is why tonight is so special.
i am ready for my performance review.
a quilt.
i would like to go third.
oh, god!
so, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
ok, give that back to me.
and if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than i am.
okay.
twenty- seven!
assistant regional manager.
i could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay.
well, me too, I have done something stupid which i would like to share.
get off the phone!
yeah, I am here, i just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game.
okay, we do not have to volunteer.
no.
you know what?
i thought michael scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
i almost worked there.
line it up phyllis.
michael!
okay, all right.
oh.
no, no, no.
my god, these could be tracings!
and inform.
this is a dummy, a la ferris bueller's day off.
no, no, no, no!
drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone is urine.
do you know who that is?
this is great.
i have some news.
okay.
from my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.
scranton.
if you are guessing forty six just say forty six.
very good!
hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned hay king.
whoa.
you know what?
i just got back from vacay.
oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?
and one would be humor.
yes i forgot about ryan's presentation.
yes, i was the first one out.
we would have fun.
dwight?
pam, pam- I am really sorry.
there is a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.
you are not standing up.
no, like you.
each and every one of you.
i trust him.
no, no.
packed with beautiful babies.
this is a classic... yeah, well, but i ... i feel like I have known you many lifetimes.
oh man, i am so mad that pam got hurt!
what?
yeah?
that plus jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
really?
no, I am just poopin'.
so, we are going to tag team it?
you will be hearing from us shortly, mr. schrute, and i think you are going to like the call you are going to receive.
this has been a test of our emergency preparedness.
i am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.
hey.
and wake up in the future.
i think she is gorgeous.
ok, you know what?
how?
i, uh... i am going to be a father.
yeah.
it itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it.
you have no idea.
when michael was in charge, this place was like the roman empire.
no!
fine!
look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon.
oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because i know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
your meeting.
I will look it up myself.
really?
mm.
you keep her occupied.
thank you.
so i would say that the old boss has always been good to dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs.
try dothraki.
yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I will read it over.
oh, let me guess.
right there.
I am going to go wash my eyes.
well, you will find none here.
he was a good guy.
yes, i promise.
somebody get jim, please!
it is from james bond.
dwight's an idiot!
i guess i do have a gay friend.
and flexible.
like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
look at him.
and i think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other.
yeah, i just remembered that i have to go to the bathroom.
okay, see you later.
yeah that is fine.
no, no.
ok.  well done.
it is about you.
I have fallen and i can not get up!
jack bauer.
great going.
that is impossible.
sure.
congratulations on being a grandma.
are you kidding?
me, me, me, me, me, me.
that is all yours.
by wanting it more.
problem solved everyone.
look at me.
many happy returns.
of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I am sorry.
there are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.
no, i think i would be bad.
i am now sempai, which is assistant sensei.
you know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?
it is too small.
it is not what you think.
okay.
that is ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
okay!
your problem now, captain jack.
is everything satisfactory with your stay?
we are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.
in the end, the greatest snowball is not a snowball at all.
where is kevin?
okay I am going to throw up.
no!
really long.
hi.
i know but I am still scared i do not know why.
so i was in the office, and i look over to our accounting division, and there is kevin malone.
no.
okay, everybody, listen up.
now was he sitting or standing?
hey, what a game, huh?
oh yeah... i know... that is what i was just saying... that is what... this is jim and pam, aka jap.
march 4th.
karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?
for what?
that is unacceptable.
phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
you know?
are you going to do this thing for me?
lady fortune is your boss.
who is on him?
it is part of your pants.
get in the car.
count to three, please.
i really think you screwed the pooch on one, creed.
no.
you are going to hate it.
let me tell you something.
he is been gone for at least two hours.
that is just an arbitrary title.
well, it turns out that teri was already suspicious, because she had caught stanley and cynthia a few months ago.
because... he knows.
kiss ass.
i found it at spencer gifts.
watch this, if i had money problems, would i do this?
that is so awful.
i am already walking.
again.
well, then it will be easier for you.
the grim reaper is here.
142 south windsor lane.
pam, karen, even phyllis.
is sex different after the baby, jim?
you will all stay at your desks until that time.
wait, is it a full moon tonight?
i would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying.
okay, I am not hindu, but... carol.
pamela.
okay.
okay, let us do another one.
come on in.
glowingly negative.
jim.
god.
you know what?
yeah.
a boss is like a teacher.
in her prime, shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
that is how you really apply the pressure.
no.
pam, pam, thank you madam.
uh, i do not know what you mean.
to commit fraud.
any questions?
good thing I am here because i do nothing.
we will?
stanley of course.
i just saw him.
go ahead and just read the frosting.
you can not have the bowl!
guys, i believe that i have figured out what is up your butts.
oh, that is my favorite ocean!
give me the pointer.
good, good, good.
toby, you are toby.
not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.
calves.
i once hit three home runs against little flower catholic.
it is got a little bit of a zing to it and i hope that it gives you a flavor of what we are all about here at dunder mifflin.
right?
... just very?
martin nash, i presume?
we will do it quickly.
your loss, stanley.
i make originals.
cool!
when i discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube</a> i did not work for five days.
come in.
okay, I will get out of your hair.
no.
i have a small problem.
everything's under control.
you are head-hunted.
does not matter.
no, no, not real bombs.
he is the most... important thing in my life right now.
because that is what you are doing.
no, he should not.
the principle is sound.
and you know where milk comes from!
that is a piece of cake.
hamster.
ahh, legs are sorta giving out.
i take full responsibility.
i am a huge woody allen fan.
nothing sticks to him.
yeah.
good.
maybe they are right?
i want the teapot.
ready?
those duke boys are at it again.
that is our most popular room.
it is from battlestar galactica.
great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
when darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
that... is actually good... because, um, i do not think i could take... my girlfriend's job.
hey, it guy.
dwight, do you have the box?
oh, yeah.
creamy skin.
yuck, pew!
what uh- wow, you are kidding me!
dwight and i are going out.
what is it of?
it is like children singing christmas carols.
i hit the ball right over the protest banners.
she is dreaming.
mose!
yes!
isabel was nice, but i hope she does not think this is going anywhere.
now, we cannot let the pedophile win again!
but come on, i mean, darryl is far more ethnic.
thank you.
michael.
oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget.
it is close.
two fifteenths.
i, for example, am playing for comic relief.
he is a good boy, does whatever i say.
oh, really?
how you doing?
playtime is over!
then you have been deducted 50 schrute bucks!
well, cool!
six percent, i know my worth.
remember the 15-scooper we had last week?
well-where is that bowl?
david, guess who I am sitting here dressed as.
just... they are going to want to hear this from you.
that is me.
oh wow another living room!
they act like i have no power.
in fact, i challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
watch the great schrutini work his magic.
let us go help africa.
my girlfriend and i broke up recently.
are you talking about a secret meeting?
you need something to sell.
same letter here and here.
how was your vacation?
assistant to the regional manager.
may god guide you in your quest.
he has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
well, first of all, i do not have co-workers anymore, i have subordinates.
a kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?
from 2:30 to 3:15.  it is the only time that bob was available.
get down on the floor.
hello  you are about five hours early to the party.
hey, i can take either side of the bed at this point.
listen up, flenderson.
no, that would not be- yeah.
you do have a problem dealing with people.
uh huh.
that is - you saw who did this and you did not stop them?
yeah.
thank you.
i just sift through them every week and i really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.
do it again.
well, i did not.
it is on the list, everybody.
all worked out in the end, though.
we did not break up.
discipline.
was there any emotion going on?
ohh...  oh, what a day.
alright.
not motivated by compassion.
anybody else?
this is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot.
have an original thought.
welcome.
what is the only thing worse than one hr rep?
although born just minutes from here, he speaks only german.
I am trying to write something funny.
he came to me, and said, "mr.
that is it?
that goes directly to the tester.
i lost respect for you in florida.
i know, i know.
you are cooped up in there all day.
thank you, michael.

yeah.
i love the guy.
i can not andy, it is too hard.

no, he is not.
that should be a no brainer.
and I am thinking that uh, next time you are in the shower, you should check yourself out.
best night ever.
dwight!
that saved some time.
really?
so ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond.
they match the carpet it is a statement of fact.
thank you for your time, and drive safe.
...what?
better keep the... frat boys away from her.
what is taking someone from behind?
sounds good.
because you are engaged to andy.
there he is!
it is not up to me?
here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.
we must never cede control of the motherland!
all right, dwight schrute everyone.
now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?
so i need you to do some work on the st. andrews account.
oh, look at that.
that is my spool.
that is right!
andy?
yes.
you know, i feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
shut, it.
michael... come on.
that is not... she is... okay.
they will not make me manager, and i will not settle for anything less.
are you mental?
joke's on you because i know morse code.
jim halpert.
phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you do not often speak your mind, but you should.
i am not leaving this office.
i do not get that, i do not understand that.
well, let us put  them in the hallway.
yeah.
y'know what, I am the only one here who you have not asked about the new office.
and right over there is where you found out that meredith was prostituting herself for outback steak.
that was not a shake, dwight.
i have been sitting here for ten years, michael.
well... we have nothin to talk about, dwight.
meredith!
there are traditions at stake.
i will not.
i just forward it along.
i will not tell anybody.
we have a monthly staff meeting what?
we do not report it at all.
man, i worked hard.
that is no good.
can you believe that?
"michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" you mean, how can i be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional?
hey, hey, hey what are you doing?
we are going to open a six pack of whoopass.
and probably god would be the fourth one.
got it?
i hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, i think our blood bags touched.
press the pound key!
really?
I have just waited for this moment my entire life.

I am letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary.
wuh, how, how old are you?
come on.
alright.
do i regret the decision that i made?
dwight.
oh, that is brilliant!

you could not help your marriage.
relationships, we do not need no stinking relationships.
what is it like being single?

what if two couples want to go at the same time?
why do not you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.

i think you go camping by yourself-- in the wilderness.
you and i have a lot in common.
arriba!
you can not have it.
yeah.
i do not care, they are your oats.

i know that i probably messed up your sale.
ohhh, no.
keep it on there for another five minutes.
what do you do?
straight up.
"you are foir-ed."  i think if i had a catchphrase it would be, "you are hired, and you can work here as long as you want." but that is unrealistic, so... get set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott.
what do you mean?

yes.
welcome back!

okay, so... can i tell people you are going to be there?
he-who-must-not-be-named?
gardner!

what makes her beautiful?
okay meredith, let us give it a shot.
well let me tell you something, something from the heart.
got cat turd collector written all over him.

yeah.
yeah!
no, they are just hotties.

i do, too.
that is true.
thank you.
it is truly the silent killer.
please pass your future mrs. michael scotts forward.
a lot of them.
they can move much more efficiently.
I am like, what?
oh, come on.
that is impossible.
just going to walk over here-  whoa, whoa, I am slipping and falling!
i mean, you have got it all.
jim, shut the door.
and my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
I will try again.
get in there!
and it was not even me.
just, write it down, please.
dar de- dar de dar.
just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone.
i do not care, i do not show up.
oh!
toby, just do it!
it does not sound like much, but its enough for me.
maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
and you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
and then i inserted my penis- into your- vagina and- admit that there is a chance.
good.
and on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend."  "tall" and "beets." and say hello to cheri, who is your black wife.
oh.
I am just scaring him.
today is about herpes.
why are you dressed like that?
or, i will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
yeah!
well, i passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee.
come on.
fillipellers, how is it hanging?
i invited everyone in the office because it is not a day for just jim or pam or the baby or me.
was it worth it temp?
actually, that would be a good salary for me, do not you think?
so I have got your resume here, but it is not telling me everything.
ten reams for the us district court!
escape is impossible.
i can make him talk, michael.
stanley knows what I am talking about.
she going to be fine, so let us just... sprinkles?
okay.
now what?
oh, how much is this going to cost?
uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
grapes.
do you remember me from last year?
about dressing your best today?
right?
here is the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the eiffel tower.
we do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment.
so who else?
hey carol, how goes the real estate biz?

you do not have to, january this contract says it all.
no.
i should be mad at you guys.
yikes.
um... yeah.

right?
here is toby from human resources.
pam?
and for the sales staff, a new fax machine.
oh yay!
ahhhh!
yeah!
you are only one third as beautiful and only half her height.

i took charge.
the refreshments?
it was a lovers' quarrel.
um... oh, where is that?

I am not going to say it.
yeah.
that is what america is built on, big ideas.

major personnel crises averted.
um.
does not it?
he is a- yeah, he is alright.
oh, little help.
there will be no questions.
does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year?
i really do.
or a major insurance carrier.
i just need to tell them.
yeah, obviously you are.
well, i am in america and i am online, so i do think it involves you.
oh my gosh, now she is up.
no.
let us have this stupid little game, alright?
was that part of the...?
and you cannot screw around there.
the way that boy looks at the galactica is precisely the way i look at the galactica.
it is michael scott.
oh god, what was that?
those guys from vance refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
let us go, let us go!
oh.
jim will not sign my expense report.
looks so tiny in my giant hand now.
uh huh, kenneth road, born and raised.
so... it is an analogy.
we should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
stop doing rhyming poetry.
no.
this is it.
now, then.
look, I am going to offer you a little piece of advice.
oh, man, i can tell you confidently that it is not going to be okay.
very funny.
gather round.
so welcome one and all to the world premiere of corporate crapfest!
he loves to surprise!
i have.
well, it looks like there is going to be a clean-up on aisle five.</i> I am not here to learn how to mop, I am here to learn how to play hockey.
deal!
damn it!
i want a party that makes me feel like i am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... i want an antigravity machine.
keep your acceptance speeches short, i have wrap it up music, and I am not afraid to use it.
i kneel before you.
that might be kind of fun.
we are going to switch back and forth, the driving.
shhh.
here is the language skills and cognitive development area.
michael scott, as seen on tv.
dwight-elicious.
what does he know?
aww, really?
push.
do not tell my fiance I am drinking on a wednesday.
if you want to tell me - oh no!
really.
there is a man's life at stake here.
that is great.
plenty of space in the parking lot, spot.
come on.
but ... i do not care about assigning blame.
not so much.
i deserved that promotion, not jim.
what do you do with the hog dogs that you do not sell?
have you seen it?
hey!
time out.
hmm... that is a tough decision.
swap maybe?
and who is jesus' dad?
go!
this is a leadership training exercise.
anybody famous?
you set me up.
hey jim, jim.
i do not know.
while you were gone... while you were gone, jim glued my desk drawers together.
it is just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to tallahassee, florida.
her name?
-jim"  nice!
nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
just fudge the numbers." not bad, pretty funny, i do not appreciate condoning corporate fraud though.
well this is it.
i want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and i share after i have passed on to new york.
it is not a doomsday device, gosh.
i want it to be a party that the guys in new york watch on the web-cam and say, "wow!
you nervous about seeing karen again, since she was the other woman?
and many more!
and before that happens i need to get laid.
sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads.
what is our excuse?
which one of these is coolest?
you are not.
the dealio of life.
god!
aah!
lists are good.
eeeh!
excellent decision.
no, just look.
hurl your feces.
nice to meet you.
pure chump bait.
no, no, no.
everybody can laugh.
a lot of  them.
ok. watch out kelly, he might sucker punch you.
all right, all right, I am on a roll.
excuse me, can i get a photo of the best mom and the best dad please?
so what i was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud?
got a real special surprise for you.
in a folder?
animals, machines, vast virtual armies.
he started his own company, and now he is back.
okay, here we are in the conference room.
if there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
I am not listening to music!
we at sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers.
we are going to prove, what the hell is that music?
you tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
they say she walks these hallways.
and how about casual friday again, huh?
say goodbye to wasteful buildings.
well, you know what?
hey...ok no.
you sure?
cut.
hey, hey, you know what?
um, pam, i have to let somebody go today.
...like a tip?
i do.
scranton!
i actually dance all the time.
none of your business, jim.
dwight, wow.
it is all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
also, i have never missed a day due to illness.
no, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that is much harder to do.
okay.
fruit is so much better when it is dried.
she probably scrubbed it <i>into</i> the fibers of the carpet.
do you copy?
ok, just remember to keep breathing.
mister overdramatic, what is up kevin?
let us stay here.
okay, bags.

because i know it happened.
barack obama.
talk!
what phyllis?
ok. kelly, how are you?
hey.
what a game.
fire him!
geesh, dwight!
well, it is a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
i got it.
I am on it, do not worry.
well, you know what?
we were more than we were.
you are so colorful.
jo!
and the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.
oh god!
what?
because i look at somebody like jim halpert and i think, that guy can do anything he wants to do.
town cars are actually better, though.
tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
mrs. allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.
wait a second.
no.
how are you guys doing?
i am trying to make your kids respect you.
cover me!
here we go!
no, I am kidding.
you are disgusting.
that is vodka and i mixed it with orange juice.
oh, you sigh like january i broke jan's heart, david, and it was awful.
huh!
get up.
this may be phyllis' only wedding ever.
okay, some for, some against.
guy's gripe session.
oh right.
you down with the dundies?
pippity poppity.
oh, honey, here is stanley.
congratulations, ryan.
right?
ugh...  I am in.</i> oh yeah!
I will take her to lunch.
he says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff.
what?
what a loser.
oh... wow.
i wrote that.
i want to do it today.
ok, what is up?
everybody in the conference room now.
aah!
okay.
same thing happens with my cows if i do not tend them frequently enough.
how often can you actually donate blood?
well, I am the one offering the job.
you down with the dundies?
we will go.
what do you think?
and it is the sincerest form of flattery.
did you pee on a stick?
all right.
reservation for michael scott.
i cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
okay.
whoo kay.
you are too young.
we both know why I am here: to see... you... naked... while... I am... naked.
how many times have i told you?
who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
the judge is in session.
drinks on me!
heart is.
that is... who makes that?
i will locate the wedding crashers and report them to phyllis.
adolf hitler.
what?
ask the climate.
what do you know?
as has michael and as has holly.
think i did a good job?
i know you are going to like this.
this is going to be nothing like the party you have been planning.
...noted.
we all have a hero in our heart.
hey!
wow.
that is what i do, steal my trick.
no need we can just check the security tapes.
do you have your money belt?
jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk.
why do not you just leave?
let us line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything.
dwight, a genuine rastafarian wig.
just... why?
with the jello.
I will call her back.
now, when dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, i think he is speaking out of turn.
wa... wa... wait , someone is coming.
but not very many people know that.
just wrap your heads around the reality of that.
look at the intern to your left.
i would be embarrassed to be good at it.
everybody ready?
nothing to fear.
angela can stay the same, but we will change andy to dwight.
okay, question.
never again.
yes, all right.
just... just fill up the cup.
with pleasure.
it is cool.
you really hid it well.
listening.
yes, jim, i do.
but did you see the way they looked at me?
conference room, 15 minutes.
it is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics.
woo!
get outta here.
no, you stop.
no it is not.
all right, fine.
what is his name?
we are office drones.
hi.
i think you are inspired.
you are bad.
coffee?
yes.
we have to have done something wrong.
never, ever, ever give up.
to the left?
okay, am i grabbing this one?
the suspense is just so exciting, is not it?
see you all tamale.
right.
what do i do with my bonus check?
I am unhappy when I am with her.
why do not you want to go tonight?
and now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
and unless you have a better argument than that, i suggest you leave.
but you are getting written up.
and i want charles gone.
check to see if she is faking.
oh, i love that movie.
you know what you did.
this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts.
oh right, that will take a couple of weeks.
there you go.
what is michael scott's greatest fear?
keep the receipt and we will get ya' back!
right?
what are some of your small business ideas?
it is a celebrity tournament.
you know i have soft teeth, how can you say that?
tiny little crack in her pelvis.
you suck!
let us go to the zone!
that is my cab.
well, because i want to know who wrote those diseases down.
okay, i... you know what?
boom!
borat.
oh!
should the hawk even care?
today's a big day.
erin, listen to me.
hey thanks.
like the old lady from titanic.
that is good to know.
so, that is cool.
our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
fire hazard.
no, i got to go.
even his name.
listen, i may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.
i can not believe this does not make you mad!
i just want to say, this is not my fault.
and I am the rootin'-est-  i can not do this.
i love you guys.
uh, yes you are.
did you also know that china has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal.
i am such a stupid idiot.
get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
nothing.
no, no, we are going to have three closets, one for each base, no homers.
not my problem.
i think i am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
he is either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain.
...so good.
no, frankly, i do not.
so it is a very simple argument of why i should be put in charge of southeast printer sales.
okay.
there is a lot of choices.
we are no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
i do believe that the game is a big hit.
gah!!!
do not remember me like this.
have a good morning.
not it is not, there is some in the straw.
but i feel pretty good right now.
happy.
i could have gotten that, idiot!
sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn.
i should have been lovers with her first and then friends.
uh, i meet a lot of people.
i like a little feather in my nuggets.
two charges of loitering, one noise complaint, several speeding tickets.
and air travel.
oh yeah, you are going to owe me big time.
i said that yesterday.
so... oh, stanley kaplan!
same story, different ending.
you are so not...oh god.
right?

so you have come to the master for guidance?
guilty.

now i am saying sabotage.
so, uh, pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
hey, mikela lasker, how are you?
yes.
um, actually, I am sending ryan on a top secret mission.
would that make you happy?
because the michael scott paper company is about to open a big old can of whoopass on dunder mifflin.
and i entertained dwight to no end with my bar stories.
it was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times.
a-holes.
no.
i never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place.
sales is about people, ryan.
that is... i, i think that... ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening.
i want you to go back to the office and i want you to get the real stuff.
the gun is a beaumont-adams.

I am sorry.

she strong?
i know the market, i know the price points.
I am just saying if they did throw their hats I have got a great line for that: "may your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... that was a pretty good line.
dammit, kevin!
yesterday i was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel.
come on down!
got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to.
he is gone.
see?
nba, wnba.
it is a town car.
because if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell.
okay, fine.

I am going to start dating her even harder.
all cases are solved with logic.
secret weapon!

the following weekend, i drive up.
well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for pda here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best valentine's day present that a person could receive.

maybe you have some kind of bladder infection.
why do not you just take these women, put  them in a burlap sack, and hit  them with a stick?
oh, i feel like there were so many more people on this bus.
that is the problem, that is the problem.
hey.

I am going to kill him.

I would think about it.

they have no willpower.
right here!
oh, it is happening.

it has to be official, and it <i>has</i> to be urine.
ah.
wow, this is tough.
okay, well.
the trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
no, this is a war, and i will not stop, i will not rest.
[todd starts humping dwight and michael who are still under the desk.
kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer.

and then in an instant it was not.
oh, god, i hope it is urine.
all right.
no.
okay, I am calling the police.
exercise is good for depression.
thank you so much.

i do not care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... i never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I would just like to say...  con-quack-ulations!
well actually i can not cook, and i am starting a restaurant.
today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.
i looked at the bag.

because of the time i got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
this is shaping up to be an awesome day for dwight.
so close.
god, that sucks!
he is a madman!

it is like, "really, jim?
this location is the superior court - it is a big deal.

yeah!
well here we go.

you watch it!
so what is it going to be, kapoor?
okay.
is he in good shape?
i do not want to do that.
yes!

my point is i said what i wanted to say and mema, i hope you heard every word.
it is just.
that is how you deal with a thief.
what are you thinking?
oh, god!
ha!
there is nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
so, kevin and creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
they might be listening to us you never know.
grab on.
no.
thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.
you could... stay or... let us start with the warehouse.
it dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, let us get back in there.

i learned that she has read "lonesome dove" three times.

oh, not going to happen.
yes?
ah!
can we wait till i get off work?
carroll, how are you?
you know what, I am actually going to bid on this.

it is not a charity; it is a business.
oh, my man.
every single one.
I am not going to answer it oh, no, no, no, no.
do not.
it seems a little foggy.
wish me luck.
case closed.
when andy is gone you answer to me.
and there is no middle ground.
ok, alright.
ten years, you will figure it out.
and I am going to do the same with all of your clients.
just, you know, find it.

we get a say.
here is a question for you.
things were not this bad when just michael was manager.

i am all over this.
let us celebrate.
okay.
okay.
that is a big cost.
something happened!
i have it too.

and i think for a small company that is really  someone went to the bathroom.
mmwa.

you know what, we should actually rehearse.
ok. you are welcome.
but first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch.
i do not care if he goes and files a report and says that we are nothing special because i think our future is very bright.
spit that out.
you do not... you do not call retarded people "retards".
no!
jim!
here we go.
no, that is the problem.

an hour long shower with guys.
uh huh.
okay.
but things are going well with carol.
notice my persistence and recall.
nope!
they are back?
listen.
i know, i know you are angry.
uh, just do not let anybody in my office under any conditions today.
okay, I am going to have to supplement that.
i do not really get it because we are not doing that bad and our numbers are going to come up.
ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year.
and i think i have come up with the reason why.
we could go back and forth all day.
do not patronize me, pam.
so put on your saris, it is time to celebrate diwali.

okay.
i, um, I am out the door.
... there are no movies in prison.
oh, man, am i a woman?
no!
I will set it up right now.
whoa.
i took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life.
I am certainly not going to do it myself.
you are the one who trained me, michael.
i am nigh!
oh, oh, i take umbrage to that premise...ses.
i spared pam, and i may feast off of her profits for years to come.
and you can hug it out, bitch.
and that is why, i feel, that i deserve this raise.
and at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab." i do.
ok. after you.
do not leave us, help us, we need help jim!
I will make sure that is covered.
it is okay with me but he is going to want me in there.
there you go.
15 lives.
does he have access to their medical records?
uh, yes, i am.
what is this?
all right!
that is where you first met michael klump.
it is part of my green initiative.
nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, that is shizzle.' okay.
an eternal journey, and i wish him well.
so, oh!
he thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
excellent question, pam.
no, no like this.
oh, i own that city.
excellent.
where is he?
gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you are at an all-time low.
i am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.
oh.
no!
i will meet with him, but I am not going alone.
come on!
... no, I am catholic, too.
ok, that is ridiculous.
why do not you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
knit like the wind.
every year!
what is so great about your lives that you think you are better than everybody else?
dammit!
no.
and i am that big man.
hey, did you catch that up at lake wallenpaupack?
and everybody thinks he is a tease.
final touch-ups.
well, first of all, i, uh, just want to warm up a little bit.
ok. ee... i was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
uh... you never said anything.

if he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
yeah, okay.
no wonder women despise you.
i would have pulled out my concealed luger and fired first.
ever since michael dumped jan for carol, jan's been bitching out on him.
911. use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.

well, jan's email password is not dunder mifflin, sandals, jamaica, michael, michael scott, jan scott, or mrs. jan scott.
first name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a caribbean cruise.

oh, no, i do not think this is it.
you are welcome.
oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile.
thank you very much.
well, when they get my evaluation we will see if they are interested.
mmmm... you know what i really, really miss about college?

woah, what are you doing?
as dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
that is what I am talking about.
uh... hello!
and so we are going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and i know nobody's going to want to do it and i know everybody's going to complain and bitch and i do not want to have to deal with that.

that is right!
i was able to be on the scene so quickly because i was in the car that hit her.
no!
well...  ok, well...  um, was not really my fault.
but in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
why are you looking at me like that?
so it is not true.
dwight and i were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
i can do that...  my resolution is... meet a loose woman.
mr. buttlicker.
i look like an idiot.
and i want kids.
how are you doing?

michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
hey.
wait, who is dwigt?
no.
well, yeah, it is a promise.

i do not see a... price.
yes you will.
andy!
when a cat gets stuck in a washing machine.
this is so awesome.

todd packer, is going to apologize.
i swear phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at dunder mifflin.
right now is fine.
i thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.

what is this?
no!
yeah... gosh.
i had promised carol a romantic evening on the town.

it is pony.
the nard dog... what was that all about?
thank you.
do not - do not do that.
dwight k. schrute.
then do not look in my eyes.

you know, dwight, sometimes... i do not know, i think you say things just to agree with me.
okay, you know what?
hey, right?
move it!
it will not be out of my hands stanley, ok. i promise you that.
i got presents for everybody.
let us go.
men find me desirable.
meredith palmer!
sorry.
close them.
dwight schrute is manager!
you have big plans for tonight?
i heard you bought a bar, kevin.
good ideas, huh?
i have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
i am so scared... when people do not label their personal food.
no time!
they are going to have nightmares, so why do not you just shut it?
there he goes.
i knew it.
you have no idea what you are talking about.
blind-guy mcsqueezy.
and I would point to them, right?
oh god!
you could not handle my undivided attention.
you remember my cousin mose.
curly joe hitler.
thank you roy.

i wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building.
okay, i can do that.
kelly, what about ryan?
brain hurricane.
there you go.
this is my girlfriend - carol.
85 acres.
ok.  well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.
i read about something like that.
thank you.
tomorrow.
well it is funny that you should ask, because it is really more than a company... dammit, oscar!
i have been recommending downsizing since i first got here.
but the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again.
her computer crashes with the porn, and then meredith with the accident, and then... sprinkles!
therefore i know the killer to be phyllis, aka beatrix bourbon, the person i most medium suspect.
do i live near a harbor or an ocean?
hi, oscar its michael.
i want to put the top down.
hey, I would rather kill myself.
sorry to bother you.
it seems a little shady.
uh, it is not totally empty.
okay.
that file had been falsified.
'k?

on paper at least.
well, here you go.
joke's on you.
right.
thank you.
we have 15 minutes.
the bartender asked for her id which i thought was odd because i pegged her at like 35. yeah, it was weird.

he does not even want to go.
I am going to kill myself.

I am glad you enjoyed your stay.
well, I am moving to colorado to start my new life with holly.
ok!
robert's favorite songs: creep by tlc, creep by radio head.
but i was going to.
hey.
who else thought that i was leaving?
probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
no... no, this is just a stupid formality.
i deserve a bump.
you wrote down... i did not give you permission to.. i did not... you are doing the right thing.
alright.
she had a couple hundred dollars to spend, i mean, if she was able to sell her bike.

thank you.
i feel you.
you know what that is?
goodbye tooo-by!
yeah, they used to.

do we know how?
wow!
i need you to get better.
halpert, room d1.
and I will be taking pictures all along the way.
but my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.
I will go, michael.
okay.
I am been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you are going to throw it all away?
it was not just an action movie, it was die hard!
it is okay.
uh oh.
no, seriously.
I am going to have it one of these nights.
we slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.
too bad there is not a tractor here.
i, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder.
alright, skip around the room.
do not read it beforehand.
unfinished.
i love sports, i love jokes.
ok?
i have a recurring nightmare that I have been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury.
whoa, whoa, girl.
is that all you have to say to me?
everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here do not get trophies, very often.
no.
there is no limit to what i think i deserve.
arrogance.
there is another woman.
does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
man and wife.
me or andy?
oh that feels better.
that is right!
i did not see it at home, i did not see it in the bathroom, i did not see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light... the big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?

you can.
oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.

not somebody.
"this morning, i knocked myself in the head with the phone." "every time i typed my name, it said 'diapers'." "by the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier." the japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard.
okay.
letting me be a part of your life today.

but that is illegal.
c'mon, ryan.
maybe believing in god was the mistake.
yeah, but it is not brain cancer.
i do not know if i can do that.

you go talk to him.
there is nothing to see.
unless you are willing to tell me everything, i cannot accept this assignment.
now, shall we get to the mystery?
we could have integrated more chuck into the presentation.
dunder mifflin.
ok, but if it makes you feel better, I will poke holes in the box.
ordinarily i would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up.
oh, wow.

yeah, well... this is not the phone.
you are stressed, and I am taking you to lunch.
it is a 45 day/45 point.
what is more important than quality?
fax, why do not you just send it over on a dinosaur?
we should call someone.
yes!
like benjamin button in reverse.
calm down.
this is where i belong.
so, good job, everybody.
bust out your complaint files.
okay.
okay, here we go.
security deposit.
for all your paper and printer needs.
ah, well, good.

I am sorry.
I am trying!
thank you.
oh, okay, here is a good one.
let us keep this alliance totally a secret.
I am done talking.

hey, you know what?
memo to january i deserve a raise.
you are the most heartless, soulless person I have ever met.
two.
wait.
hold on, hold on!
dwight, i asked him.
sometimes you are such a little spaz!
loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
alright, find a cozy spot.
what is wrong with these people?
jan, i uh want to... can i help you?
and i want you to say something different.
michael scott, dunder-mifflin paper company.
what are you talking about?
i do not know.
no.
of course, at that point, i will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.
everybody settled in?
pam?
oh, just so you know, it is not me, it is you.
i want to do all six hours today.
which will not be hard, because it is going to be awesome.
dwight, let jim do that, please.
"hello.
alright, so, teams forming.
wallace knows that he is been gone for the last three months.
that is stupid.
okay, fine.
they are still good for another week.
alright.
my shadow's the only one that walks beside me.
yeah.
hello?
no.
what is the first thing you guys are going to do when you move in to the new office?
check it out.
it is a secret.
yeah.
the file name is "jamaican jan sun princess." not important.
okay, I will talk to you later.
it would be a great, great concert.
you pathetic, short little man.
you are so lucky you do not have this problem.
good-bye!
how do you know that?
catch-22.
tick- let us get him.
burned my foot, pam.
okay.
yeah!
there is a party in my room, 308, can not miss it, right off the elevator.
hey, there he is!
well, then, gould was not kidding.
now it is over.
how about later in the week?
let us go!
absolutely.
wow.
let us move that up.
here we go.
you know, whatever.
well, i did it too.
what was on that?
you really think this is a good idea, huh?
my ass is is on the line!
pro for ryan, he went to business school, he is my number one choice.
michael!
the thing is, angela... you are in here an awful lot.
it is a tough one.
oh, it will work.
okay.
he will be fired.
how are you going to do that?
i never want to see you working in the upstairs office again.
eeegkh!
do my time.
pam would have understood.
well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like jordan and pippin!
nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them.
do not look all the way up.
uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
lot of calories.
i am going to go get laid.
we made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
kevin, cookie.
yes!
i know where to sign.
hey hey hey.
this whole thing just kind of stinks.
oh, i dunno, they are launching a big new business plan.
was, or not my girlfriend.
it is just, i... i think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
he is been promoted to sole manager.
now, jim is going to be the client.
it is complicated, pam.
but then again, who is?
earth tones only.
that means it is literally impossible for anyone to fall off.
of course martial arts training is relevant.
pam's mom, helene.
i know.
...  what?
t-back.
so, anybody else?
you are not a total ass.
did not move my lips.
please, waste of time.
I will pay for the party.
yes.
erin, do we have the journal?
it is the easy way out.
pam?
george foreman is still considering it.
all right.
very cool, very will smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
a lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
toby... please?
number four: eat a dog.
i just got a new account for the gentleman's club in carbondale.
first of all, hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
look i could probably handle it, yes, but i think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
they are for my cousin mose.
polluticorn wishes.
he gets carsick really easily.
then do not do it.
jan knows paper.
he would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
oh nonsense , no way, no.
yes, yes i am.
they are such babies.
are there any words you would like to say, on pam's behalf?
hey boo!
no all you do is you get me to try to work on my rich friends!
oh, yeah... wow.
very valid.
hey koselli, the kos.
okay?
hey.
several people are injured.
what is so wierd?
and she still is.
yes.
all you do is dress fancy and sing.
and he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he  what?
i got it here.
oh, oh, wow!
think abou- think!
this'll be just us.
michael scott, dunder mifflin.
at first i thought, "muffin basket." then i thought, "what is even more precious to people than muffins?" ...their own children.
but it is not mandatory.
yes.
i respect him because he reminds me of somebody.
yeah.
that is great, if i wanted the dictionary definition I would buy a dictionary.
there is a raccoon in the car, dwight!
woo hoo.
when we get back to the office, pack your things.
oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.
it was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people.
that would really, really have shown him up, would not it?
she said that?
thank you very much.
yup.
300 times...  180... um that comes to 25 minutes.
you go to sleep, it is light out, you wake up, it is dark.
we are not in the playground anymore.
all you have to do it say it.
get ryan.
i will do this michael.
i encourage that.
how about scrantonstrangler666.
i invented a device called 'burger on the go'.
ok, alright.
woah, woah, woah, pam!
he went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
let us see, i know she likes apples and carrots.
i can not believe i gave her my bike!
and I am glad i did.
if you ever need any help, i am just a phone call away.
that is just how the world works, i guess.
it was kind of a slap in the face to realize that i was not as important as i thought i was to a certain young executive who i cared about.
come out here since it is a secret, and I will tell you.
idiot.
ryan, my man!
there you go.
what are you- what?
that is very gracious of you.
for realsies.
maybe i should call him and tell him that.
the city of atlanta.
i have to say, i am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
ok, i am really going to do this.
i need you to do something for me.
idiot.
guh.
okay.
but now, at a time tdb, all of the problems will be in the past.
this is where toby announced that he was going to costa rica.
no.
awards, multiple dundies.
hey.
i got to them.
go enjoy your friday.
they could be shrinking.
you know wat I am talking 'bout.
i think they both could do better.
tootenbacher.
spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.
and he ran into irritating cylons." "one of them was named michael scott, and he was an..." oh, damn it.
your turn, stanley.
I am sorry, man.
look at that.
anyone who comes in here... is going to have to take me seriously.
just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth.
through concentration, i can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
ok, i have an announcement.
you all report to me!
what kind of guns do you have?
he is not your five year old brother, dwight.
all right.
maybe I am crazy in love.
um, pam, i hate to break this to you but dwight can not stop you from being mugged.
it is a shame.
or... oh, these... all your kids?
consider it?
and no, i cannot lower my current prices.
come in the conference room and i will show you a finished sausage.
so she is passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog... and the neighbors blamed january it is like, you know, the dog should not have been outside in the first place.
much better.
gah!
why did you guys even come today?
ok. alright.
no.
we are good?
whoever has the most seeds is the king.
do not talk about nazis in front of-- you know what?
no, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around.
which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot.
do not thank me.
it is a mini-briefcase.
we need to count off.
you can- i -you know what, i have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk.
i do not follow.
oh, yeah!
people out here do not care about diseases.
what are...?
and also, chitty chitty bang bang.
uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
we are not here.
we can have a killer party right here in scranton.
what do we got, what do we got?
mmm-hmm.
you did not contribute very much.
hey!
okay.
yes, indeed.
look at that face.
everybody, let us keep  them coming... oh, god.
what do you want?
do not... i... yeah, i figured that.
I am not going to give it to you.
i believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as darryl.
i most certainly did not.
ready?
just forget it.
peta.
uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through may.
ok, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
no.
yshhyah.
my first project: increase security.
that is impossible.
this is exactly what michael moore does, famous documentarian.
you can not tantalize me.
"do not..." okay, that is blank.
okay.
it does in the state of pennsylvania.
"you need to do something about your coffee breath"- ok. shut up, shut up, shut up, dwight, ok. i do not think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
it was a lot of snap decisions.
but... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
oh, hey, is that princess unicorn?
that was good!
cauliflower and noodles.
when time is not a factor, i like to try out three or four different ones.
hey, there is like, 300 more of these.
does not matter, because i am going to take a nap.
his head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.
I am pretty sure she is baked on a professional level.
hang on!
so we can do this again.
come on.
we... um... somebody has to stay here.
here we go.
your best one?
do you know?
okay.
code red.
well, we are running a business, so.
i do not need it.
that was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything i did for you?
or in this case an email gets sent to robert california containing the consultants report from last year.
I would like to see a menu please.
jim halpert.
good, good, bro.
what you do is you put  them in a room, and you just-  hey.
he is a liar.
i never know.
two of my favorite joke areas combined.
not so fast.
when michael was denied a room at the inn, we do not know what happens because that story has not been told yet.
no, it was not!
because it was a good idea.
hey... i mean, although it is just for fun, you know we want... i was counting on you man.
maybe beavers.
stop grabbing my penis.
about the new company?
you know?
does it specify which windshield?
not a beet.
wha- use a what to cover the mouth?
really?
come on.
flash cards.
no.
he was...okay at it.
ah, good stuff, good stuff.
I am thinking about throwing it in the garbage.
well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
let us get this roof going.
i forbid anybody to freak out.
i love you.
office depot!
no i do not.
good boy.
ah, uh, i would love to, but i am really busy.
that is not how i taught you, right?
i shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
yes, monkey.
you want me to flush him?
kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
you are?
and you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
i knew it!
follow my lead.
hey.
really?
it is just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really do not know scranton, do you?
bottom line, i know the product.
on the count of three we are all going to put down our guns.
i can do both.
i agree.
have you made any sales yet?
I am sorry.
i know how to sit on a fence.
the perks.
i am meeting my new boss, nellie bertram, head of special projects.
from now on, if you are hot, sit on an ice pack.
jim, come on.
do you like tcby?
from me, big time.
okay, a little about me.
I am here.
oh, pam please behave.
yes.
oh my god!
and here we have "mister roger's neighborhood." come on over here.
nope.
oh.
michael is your superior.
hello, hello!
do not think, say it.
what?
the ceilings are lower than they were last week.
david!
$30,000?
how is the party coming along?
welcome, welcome, welcome!
okay, this is the fine work award.
if the boat is sinking, what do you save?
i do not have an idea in my head.
you did!
okay.
no.
but, we have people with the biggest hearts.
uh... no, no, no.
god, too bad.
.
yes it is!
buddy, hey!
just in case there is someone down here who should not be.
yeah.
i do not want to talk about it.
i studied him, to figure out why i hated him so much.
darryl.
oh very funny.
what are you doing for lunch?
going to get it?
most of my writing involves the latter.
the way they are programmed... you are mocking me.
sort of a brangelina thing.
jim and i are great friends.
if you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room.
who has a problem with meredith's drinking?
listen, i do not think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself.
I will tell you everything that i see.
this'll be hilarious.
what if your girlfriend is 55?
and we are off, like a herd of turtles.
to can-a-da.
here we go.
i want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
this is hers, she left her glove.
so who is the godfather?
let us do it!
what?
there are over four hundred of these!
what?
your turn, you have to go.
sharper image is still considering it.
grassy knoll, boom!
wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.
is he as matronly as phyllis?
kind of sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all.
first thing in the morning then.
while i was away, jim had my desk shipped to me in roswell.
hey.
may i have your attention please?
and as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in schrute farms.
oh, wow.
i should talk to her.
why do not you go home, and come back for the party?
can not you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
ooh.
i have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax.
you know what, i am on a deadline here, and just... ok. thanks, thanks for your help.
give me the bottle or you are fired.
the chicken?
no, i think it is- yep.
what 's your confession?
meh.
and i will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
against who?
here we go.
i would have never called him that if i knew.
but he is unavailable.
you resemble a tolkien character.
let us start... from the ground <i>up</i>.
breathing.
the customer is always right.
stop!
re-shun.
this is the moment when scranton and stamford come together as one.
it is where business happens.
oh, why?
yeah!
we have let michael down, and it is 85 percent your fault.
you ever think of that?
kevin.
i can see that happening, yes.
it scares me.
okay, you know what?
so phyllis... i want you to go find firecrackers.
the guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.
<i>midnight, oscar!</i>  do not worry, kelly will be training you first.
can you do that?
dwight.
pam.
or does somebody miss me?
smells like it.
what about... ...january
I am a decent baiter.
okay, ryan.
stop, stop, stop!
dwight schrute, assistant regional manager.
i just want you to treat him like my nephew.
you are not a liar too are you?
crucial.
i ruv you all!
but you said you liked it.
no, no need, it was a non-stick grill.
maybe someday they will hire someone who looks like a younger version of him.
i used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him.
i know everything there is to know about paper.
oh no?
do you know what the f. stands for?
what are you doing?
how you doing?
hey, ryan.
beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.
ok, wendy.
michael, i told you, it was because it was new year's eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
those  are nature's best mushrooms.
the man is supposed to do that.
tango.
no, you do not.
you did!
did you ever think of this?
you know, we really do not announce out loud our sales that much.
nothing fancy.
so, okay.
get pam.
you think this kid could be a fighter pilot?
no.
stop it!
shake my hand.
a secret about phyllis.
you excited?
i am going to tell her that i need to redecorate my condo, and i need her help.
so you are pmsing pretty bad, huh?
well, i never thought I would see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.
I am thinking about having my sperm frozen.
i just looked a man in the eyes and i shook his hand.
because at dunder mifflin scranton, we are not just in the paper business, we are in the people business.
everybody!
not going to happen.
i was shocked when he told me he was transferring to stamford.
so uh, last i remember tom peterman was in charge of that account?
fine, i chose the global relief foundation.
eat!
and i would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me.
whoa.
working on it.
and then i say, "hey!
well, I will land on my feet.
erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
i will conduct it.
hmmmmm?
educational.
we are not going to do it!
huh, okay.
sometimes... ...you just gots to get your freak on.
yes, it is mine.
you me?
hangin' with my crew, crew that i am one of.
I have got the key.
it blew chunks.
um, not personally, no.
i think i should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.
well, you know what?
the mayor is in the pocket of big lettuce.
because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids do not respect the father who does not respect the boss.
we are all gone.
i think you need to get the lead out.
this was merely a training exercise.
it is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title.
well, he was getting a lot of applause, and i just did not think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
yeah.
i was a greeter.
totally doing!
or, it could be... a bruce springsteen fan - what?
michael!
alright, then we are screwed.
gift bag... for you.
hey, hey, hey.
tom hanks does that.
are.
I will help you up.
no, his work family.
which one is that?
I am actually kind of po'd.
that is... horrifying.
okay, northeastern pennsylvania then.
ryan and i are going to go get some supplies and i need you to handle hiring the strippers.
you know, as you do at weddings.
excuse me sir.
pfft, "athlead"?
you know what?
i do not know how ringling brothers do it.
the meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor.
yes, i am, absolutely.
no, i do not mind.
damn it.
i do not know, regular.
people like waving, waving sells.
no queen either.
i expected more.
no.
come on.
okay...  phyllis.
god.
ah.
and roy.
let us go.
oh yeah.
for five years I have held my instincts in check because i wanted to be made manager.
oh my god, would not that be hilarious!
we hired you for three hours work and we are going to get it.
a ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out.
anybody?
thank god.
no!
alright, let me explain.
he can not now.
i order you to give me that file.
you see that?
okay, well, that is just ridiculous, so just do not, i-i do not have time for this right now.
go.
michael, i... i can handle that.
you know?
hey, hey, hey.
i sent away for it in july from a catalog.
let us look at this.
maybe I am hindu after all.
yes.
you are sure?
no!
how about 911?
pictures.
god!
fifty l. you are really going to want the booster.
that is it?
uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids.
can not do it then.
pudge has driven the forklift.
i was running with it in my belt.
i did not say that to make you feel good.
and choke on it.
tokyo?
dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest.
front and center.
you look great.
lift, lift darryl.
okay, no, no, no, no.
it should not come from you.
yes, please.
no.
a human life.
prideful idiots.
alright.
i am conducting a little investigation so I am no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.
a night... at... the roxbury.
who is getting married?
david, wait.
okay.
hey, hey craigers, my man!
look, i have no problem with women.
no.
my cds are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called case logic and, um the case logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.
and you are fun.
not dwight.
uh!
jim?
and i do not care that phillip's not my son.
nora ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
that is why i have asked you to go around and tell me you names.
michael clump is a celebration of fat people.
michael, you should not have to settle.
everybody stay calm.
the new it guy.
oka- okay!
no, david.
what for?
a gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do i.  no, seriously, guys, I am not, i do not want to go into it at all.
that you might even be a little bit dangerous.
oh, yeah.
these are pre-cooked, so it is not absolutely necessary, but i would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I am going to be having.
who had a big, puttifflin.
trust fund will take care of that!
ok. excuse me.
the vp position is mine.
let us rock some stuff here, okay?
that is right, let us do this.
same old.
so... who do you think it should be?
may i ask why you are leaving the michael scott paper company?
we got game!
it is good to see you too!
cow, goat or sheep.
yes!
good day.
I am going to see your play.
it is a booze cruise!
ugh.
well I will look into that in the morning.
she is just a great human fighter pilot.
dwight.
pam will be taken slave!
what?
we did not see any.
oh my god.
everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.
and.
that is fantastic because I have always felt that the security here sucked .
all right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative.
oh!
ha!
i will call him later with that message.
paperback writer?
a loaf of bread?
que?
i made the connection.
so just cut me some slack.
but then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion".
it is home, you know?
i could help.
what is better than giving presents?
center?
really?
thanks.
ah.
yes.
let us not tell anybody about this right now.
let us face it.
oh, i had no idea what a gift this line is." i will get the chair in.
of course.
yeah, pam.
regis and kelly!
keep it going.
how could... right in the middle of the carpet.
she has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle.
I will save you!
a little eye for an eye action.
kevin malone, you are next.
no.
michael has been talking to my biggest client.
i am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
wait, ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
and then it needed a jesus.
ah!
thank you.
ok, I am going to need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused.
ok.  he is back!
um.
my girls.
hey, dwight.
excuse me.
so sinister!
and she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, i guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of dunder mifflin, scranton.
yeah.
oh, hey, I will take a coffee.
I will tell you what, I am going to do you one better.
ha ha!
okay.
stop giggling.
you really do not get it, do you?
oh... oh god.
wow!
come on.
and i really want a wife and kids.
anybody?
gross!
do not do anything rash!
yeah.
that last thing they did was great.
'what is next?', you are probably wondering.
well, he is not dressed in women's clothes, so... you could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
besides, i think jim would be a fine manager.
ok. yeah, trust me.
how you doing?
there is nothing she can do to stop it now.
stop.
everybody in the aisle was doing it.
eight months?
you would rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
shave me.
incentive.
well, this... yeah?
i just want to go in and fix it.
no, no, listen, as a friend, i want you to have this.
give it to me.
sure you can not stay a little longer?
she is knocked up.
are we ready to go?
eager.
pam!
inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn.
oh, yeah right.
is there another option?
right?
uh... uh, i do not know.
what are the pros?
jim, what is that called?
that could be haddie.
i could just bite her head off.
yeah, kay.
if you are not in that conference room in two minutes i am going to kill you.
and that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor.
that is stupid.
I am out.
cell phones and pagers off, please.
and martin has had a bad influence, to think that i gave him the benefit of the doubt.
you are dead.
creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
it is the perfect way to start the day.
come to papa.
give me the punch card.
oh, what a topic it is.
hey.
i will say, c, a gun.
when it goes off, no more kissing.
listen up!
like a cow thing.
now you ruined it.
they are way too focused on work.
yeah todd, decent idea.
just.. we are not going to pay for a bathing suit.
johnny carson.
bam!
he grew into a man overnight.
this is an opportunity.
gabe?
the least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation!
but real life is not like that.
yeah.
be quiet.
hey you know what?
who to pick?
are we, do you think?
slack lining, please.
that...hello.
this is real life, baby, and you got to own it.
stop asking me hypothetical questions, ok?
belsnickel is here!
jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
because you went with michael scott.
i will not be undersold.
self taught.
so think about it.
what is that?
no.
yes!
i know.
and many people consider that to be the paris of northeastern pennsylvania.
nice try.
i know.
you, are you sure you do not want a pony?
and I am surprised that you did not question me in the first place.
okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay.
that is a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.
jim can leave anytime he wants.
you finished?
michael.
it is done.
oh, my god.
it does not matter what i know.
when i was five, i imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn.
i basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then i find out that one of my best ones did.
no.
my ideals at a party?
at this time, we are issuing a full recall of all sabre gh400 printers.
the other branch managers are total morons.
I have got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder!
hey phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires.
that is funny, too.
hey.
so... just sit down kelly.
okay, fine.
cool.
so, like a freedom tree.
that was your idea.
although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
and bingo was his name.
because, well, jim.
i will not.
there was a terrible war, ugh, so many died.
100 dollars, great.
uh... no.
that is so cool.
well, that is probably from the test drive.
right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting.
what?
i would have never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
i feel sorry for those people.
i can not hear what he is saying, but he looks like he is really into it.
it is the "whitest sneakers" award!
number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra.
lot of fire where you are going.
because I have got nothing got lose.
where are you?
play some games?
that is right!
not even close, meredith.
no longer a pam-jim alliance against dwight.
i hate so much about the things that you choose to be.
you are telling me, david wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
let us do this.
tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
i set the rules and you follow them.
my lips are sealed... bangles.
and i will not miss him.
you do not need a mom.
that got a big laugh.
okay.
i just wanted... i just wanted to do it our way.
oh, blue blast.
seriously, where the hell is dwight?
stuff happens, right?
my gift.
I have got a solution.
watch how it is done.
next round of drinks is on me, people!
eleven years i could have been working on the scarn nebulus.
i know me.
my first day of school, i had lice, and no one would play with me.
so much crap.
you know what?
i love counting crows.
no no, all right.
but the best thing about it is that we are not going to have to give you any severance pay.
well, mister ball, it is been a pleasure.
when somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.
things can be replaced, phyllis!
no!
she drives a green camry.
you need to vanquish fear!
now.
I am embarrassed.
best out of seven.
so... did not you think 'lazy scranton' was funny?
and i always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, i think it might be one or the other.
i am always acting in self-defense.
mmm!
oh, wow, so quickly.
how you doing stud?
in my contract, it is stipulated that i provide a temporary work space.
i would have been chief of surgery... or a cowboy.
yes!
because it is for me and michael only why is everyone clumped around accounting?
still deciding?
we can do... oh.
well do not look so surprised.
i... yeah, yeah.
i need my assistant to the regional manager.
oh no!!
american, irrigation, and night-time.
wait!
okay, okay.
hit it, dwight!
yes!
let us get it started!
phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I am the real thing.
the sex is not nearly as good as it used to be.
on you mark.
i reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
holly and i are soul mates.
now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department?
i did, however, tip my urologist, because... i am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
growing up, i always thought i would become an actor.
this is considered to be polite.
michael.
okay.
do not do that.
you came up with this idea.
no.
give me the job!
and he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper.
like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he is tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.
tell me what you feel.
okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
still not seeing the problem here.
and your ebony tower.
i want an answer by tomorrow.
on the first day.
okay, we are good.
oh... what, um, what is your commute like?
what are you guys thinking?
you are shouting it from the back of a horse!
not in my house.
just stop it.
here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
i can also make it the sky.
randall, cfo, resigned.
we did.
no.
and jim!
you regret attacking me now, hick?
no, no.
snowboarding?
alrighty, dwighty, let us see how you did.

this golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance." the holy grail.

ohhh, what have we here?
excited to talk ideas.
meredith has an e-vite from jim.
these are my party-planning beeyatches.
bye.
you are no doubt wondering why i have left this note.
maybe this could be my pam.
"meredith is so old..." "she is so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her." that was not even mine.
you know what, that is the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate.
and... i have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly.
why did you come back?
it is going to be great.
um, I am going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.
let us see the salesmen.
I am going to of have some of this meat sandwich.
i do not know whose fault it was.
ohhh, god.

andy, i got you a genuine jamaican t-shirt.
oscar, right here.
i lost my train of thought.
and I am looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
i do not get it.
i want to get personal and i want you all to really open up.
it is a european cut.
show  them, show  them the other side.
just-in case.
what is?

no.
no, pictures are too interpretive.
erin, back row.
because with them, it is an everyday stand and i still know their names in the morning.
yes he is!
what... everybody was scared out of their wits, man?
do you want to do another test?
ryan the temp!
"some say the only failure there is is the failure to try."  that is wrong.
where we can crank it!
that is not appropriate.
it has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
what is taking that guy so long?
yes!
i know... what?
three stooges.
which is higher?
and today they are being distracted by the other booths.
give me the phone.
nothing.
okay.
your gayness does not define you.
take one, take one.
i am.
oh, no, no.
i am upper management.
no, i do not think they are.
and i just do not think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
who here is planning a trip to youngstown, ohio?
he is like mozart, and I am like mozart's friend.
she gets it.
michael, give that.
there is a private shower area.
ingredients.
to my chickens I am the scranton strangler.
that could be a little confusing, because in sales a-b-c means "always be closing." shut it.
yeah.
write legibly people.
and then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
I am casting a movie and I am looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman.
take the stairs!
business is always personal.
what is a pap smear?
nanoo, nanoo.
who is this?
boom.
which puts me at a disadvantage, because i bring my own water to work.
so, once you have seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it is so much fun.
that will not be necessary tonight.
hang on tight.
you could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet.
unless you mean gonorrhea.
i appreciate this so much.
slander i say!
may i have your attention?
"california is bankrupt, and california, california."  what?
how many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies?
well, you did not, because i know where ya hid the diamonds.
this is what I am talking about.
boo.
i should not go in there.
is that egg salad?
you are a god.
every single time, it is come up 150 over 100. your husband is a pathological liar.
here we go!
wait, what?
yes.
that is... that is very nice.
you roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from dwight's caffeine corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and pam... erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
hello.
oh, yeah, put her through.
nothing's stopping you.
just do not, do not talk- do not talk- just stap it yap it!!!!
it... i can not believe-ee.
this is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.
what is... what is that?
ladies and gentlemen!
now where is my bride?
toby.
what is going on?
what quality would make you a good sales associate?
would you care to bang it out over lunch?
what?
yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
i do not know either.
there are fire-eaters all over the place.
these are our accountants.
makes your job superfluous.
it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
inside job.
oh really?
what is the antidote?
so you heard schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
eh, its not that early.
how are you?
how are ya?
what happened?
and... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
you meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that is how you do the scarn!
how ya feeling, better?
I would prefer it if they died, because it is not right.
but now, no.
alyssa?
$18,000 and a chance at the title!
what is that?
wow.
thanks.
you never touched my propecea, or my accutane, did you?
for the record your mom came on to me.
do not do that.
you are very exotic looking.
take it away.
do not get stuck on the barbed wire!
alright.
we have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
i mean, our courtship can proceed?
well, the alert was already set to "red" because of stairmageddon.
do not worry, it is just a bull tranquilizer.
i do not think I am overstating it when i say that toby is a plague on this company.
yeah, maybe I will never be manager, but i just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and i must say, it is the most pleasant I have ever seen stanley.
always.
i dare you.
the jamaicans do not have a word for "impossible." how hard is a luau?
really?
the air force?
no, that was- I am just getting into the first act.
look at that.
oh... there is a god, and he has a plan for us after all.
oh, it is on, phyllis, it is so on!
but do not tell anybody that i have anything to do with it because if they ask me, i will say that you are crazy.
please.
hey.
and i have another one of them in the nude.
give it to me dwight.
it takes a big man to admit his mistake and that is what i did.
where did you leave it?
wow, very cool you went back and got your degree.
uh-huh.
we are not selling.
movie monday!
oh, ok. cindy!
come here, I will show you.
ihop.
wait, it is that easy?
you started with this company, as a fine young man... oh, okay.
no, no no no no.
it does not matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea.
life is precious.
the problem, jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition will not receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff.
apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now.
maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for meredith's son.
presenting deangelo vickers!
scavenger hunt?
some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat.
suck it!
i really messed up.
all right, come on down meredith!
where did you hear that?
do not mess with colorado.
oh yes.
get out of here.
no, that is skeptical.
michael?
so maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
you know what?
hmm?
I am going to, for old time's sake.
okay.
this mexican guy.
I am sick of this.
it is been sitting in my car all day.
i saved a life.
people are always coming to me.
purses are for girls.
you mean like a lair?
now I am going to ask you just a few simple questions.
you mad?
and you closed it.
yeah, baby!
good.
uh huh.
so stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
who is there?
excellent.
i wish i had a lair.
by leaning back, and by whispering, i established a dominant physical position.
am i going to tell them?
thank you for noticing.
i do not want to do any of that.
and that is all that counts.
right?
what?
oh, my life... everything's wrong.
i worry about you.
you sit down, you are supported.
I am starting my own paper company.
can smart car talk?
so i do not think i need to wait out dunder mifflin.
congratulations phyllis.
what?
oh, slow!
that is... that is a great story.
okay, go, go, go, go!
want to be a manager?
michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited.
ah, thank you sir.
i can let you come and go as you please-there is your freedom.
i spent all morning on it.

brain fart.
just a little announcement folks, remember, the dundies is a black tie affair.
one of us is out of here by the end of today!
happy halloween, jerk!
any - it just - you know what, i would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.

she is an anorexatic.

thank you.
ask him his name.
yes, i have a wig for every single person in the office.
does not seem so macho now, does it?
indubitably.
it is not.
like park on it.
while you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about.
hey!
please.
it is just the first... girl that popped into my head.
we do not know what they are going to say.
okay?
hey.
but as you know, david and jan, it is much more.
i miss him so much.
ms. beasley if yer nastay!
which means they are not acquiring new business.
may i have your attention please?
this is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of splenda.
but i do know this.
are you referring to alchemy?
and the sexy looks between you and pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it is creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
oh.
you know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences.
okay.
i want it to be like... "hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "um, well, i do not, i do not know.
do you understand, you forced my hand?
yup.
but nobody really respects her.

i was thinking of proposing to esther today.
hey, look at that.
what a day!
you know what, okay, excuse me.
I am all better.
i wrote letters.
even if it did not, at least we put this matter to bed.
you are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to angela that made her feel uncomfortable.
yeah... did you see that!
voila, right in the wall.
for example, jan and i have a safe word in case things go too far.

you know what?
vomicillin.
I am just happy that i got this meeting.

i do not know how i feel.
you know experiencing freedom.
sounds good.
what are we supposed to do?
okay.
oh, you move on.
have a seat.
right?
maybe the michael scott paper company was a huge mistake.
i come here.
so i thought we should have cpr training class and of course you can not get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it.
if it would help you to forget, i could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
i do not need your help.
kay.
he loves it.

you have never been cooler.
my god, what have they been teaching you?
listen up kid.
...you can take a five, if you want.

I am proud of you.
watch out dwight.

you did not get the joke.
eh, it is not worth it.
good for you.
how are you doing, man?
hurry back.

mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
i do not see what is so hard to believe about that.
you are a warrior.
hello, dwight.

we are going to put our best minds on it.

no.
listen, I am a very busy man.
ok. you tell  them.
do not have a heart attack.
ok. i think that i have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
yes.
it was the warehouse guys... ... dwight, they embarrassed us... ... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
yes.
in the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.

i know.
that is johnny depp.
confession: i have done pda in the office.
you like cosmos?
the most sacred thing i do is care and provide for my workers, my family.

okay, listen.
but what is the point?
stanley, as a fellow dunder mifflin employee i feel for you.
i do not know.
were there any connections between any of us?
and you know what you are going to have?
i did not...  did we get a fax this morning?

I am joking.
got to represent.
but if you think that extortion is worse - it was a beaumont-adams, if that helps.
oh, i assume I am going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
that was a test.
every second you sit there is an hour off your life.
okay, okay.
through the art of the swap, i will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
what are you doing?
idiots.
I have worked here for 12 years.

black tie optional.
i like starting each day with a sense of possibility.
and i had spoken to teresa about a room with two safes?
did he threaten you?
jeffrey lionel dahmer.
she hit me?
that is nothing.

you see, andy rejected you.
for instance, "thank you, mr. blank.
what time we got?
no matter... where.
I am just going to have to run right through you.
hey, it is not a surprise.
i made the whole thing up, dwight.
I am so proud of them.
uh... it was like eight years ago?
we are in teams of two and we are on a mission.
dunder mifflin.
guys!
oh ok. i have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow.
get out of here.
five times for $30,000?
i have my per diem.
i need you to hose my aunt.
a nun who has a beet for a head.
...simpsons.
the babies that i make with her, will be my children.
... okay, I will tell you what.
and then we will destroy the man himself.

why does not oscar run the meeting?
i was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
uh, yeah, i get a little frustrated when I am dealing with incompetence.
you and your wife, and you have kids.
i have a roommate, uh, vijay chokalingham, he is a sophomore at queens college.
ya know.
ladies, take a breather.
um, cool.
because this is way, way too good.
because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to.
i very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.

and if i thought you had done a better job, i would be saying nicer things right now.
kelly.

shirty, mole, lazy eye, mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman.
I am reconsidering sending them back anyway.

jan and i broke up.
you should never settle for who you are.
you can be martha stewart's receptionist!
i actually hung this on the wall myself.
he is a homosexual.
i spent a lot of dough.
and ryan.

class is not canceled.
ugh, forget it.

e-quality.

I am guessing he is some kind of friend.
the pressures of my office are insane.

you want to go for a ride?
best of luck, phyllis.
i need ideas.
who is it?
damnit!

pam 6.0. oh, look.
i have a very top secret mission for you.
fine.
rebel yell, billy idol really?

michael, it is phyllis.
I am going to kick it off.

does holly feel that way?
actually, I am sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, casino night.
dwight, just... look, i just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake.
and... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?
so if there is a lesson to be learned here and I am not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.
he is getting into the spirit of the festivities.
did you see the game last night?
this office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
have you finished with the sketch?
you should know that.
elizabeth, i want you to sit here.

like stanley, having an affair?
okay... I am going to toss the ball to pam.
I am in the brig.

case closed.
and thank god I am not darryl.
I am looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.

i would kill with the brother stuff.
no, no.
i could have fallen off a roof today... and you do not worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... and there are no roofs in coal mines.
i was going to call you in anyway.

he will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when i find the place, i have to buy everyone drinks.

idiot.
uhhh... blow out the candle.

yay!
are you sure?
yeah!
we were just at different places in our lives.
i could take or leave the perks.
and that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing.
i give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts.
pump it up!
permission granted.
a lot.
i sure do.
pack man, i thought you were a girl!
good.

that is what she sai   nope, but... okay.
what?
hi.
buh-bye.
'gy-na' said that?
thank you.
i would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.

that is a little much.
top 80 percent!
here is one.
i am michael scott, his mentor and boss.

come on over here, big boy!
and this is what i get?
stop kissing me.
finally I will have someone at my desk clump who gets me.
i was ahead of the car.
let us take a couple of nights and stay here and think about aunt shirley's offer.
can not you see that?
so i expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
hahahaha.
congratulations on your one cousin.
you know what, i resent the implication that i would keep that secret.
i give them food.
I am your son now; you can visit him on holidays.
china is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
you suck!
I am not playing.
hi.
stop the bus.
tell you one thing, dunder-mifflin is here to stay.
i know where this is going.
just put "the hospital." contact number: just put 9-1-1. I am busy.
no?
i wrote down a list of bullet points why holly and i should be together, and I am going to find the perfect moment today and i am going to tell her.
all right.
i do not want to say.
yes!
but, let us give her a round of applause.
who did you have?
I have got some photos.
uh-huh.
how 'bout a toast.
why do not you use them?
like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
woo!
ed's tires is thinking of making a change.
actually i think it is not loud enough.
but the little cars go in the compact spot do you mean to me?
orientation is over.
why... are you here?
alright.
yeah, well, i owe you that at least, right?
hm mm mm mm.
well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there is a lot of dumb people out there.
anything could have been in there.
it is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
you are fake salivating over a soviet era russian.
i have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry.
attention, everyone.
yes.
no, I am no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person.
good.
you are getting so funny!
see you later.
that cool?
calm down, just listen.
she bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she is got to be kind of nervous.
dwight, do not, do not be a suck up.
oh I will just look at the one sheet myself.
how do you know it is going to be a boy?
yeah.
jim is in charge of stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line-green for money-sales, get it?
hello?
no, computron, actually i think cooper's is the best.
they did not get to me.
i want you to get your ass out of my face.
except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, i need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
can i talk to you for a second?
get  them there.
I am a deer hunter.
here we go.
hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
who is there?
hey hey, fellers.
zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel.
I am talking about... hmmm.
working in an office can lead to depression.
wow.
yes.
china.
i said stop.
alright?
maybe, i do not know.
what now?
that is a good point.
jim!
you are staying here until we figure this out.
no.
cumberland mills?!
pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.
he could be right behind us.
he was not volunteering today.
it was us?
you are great.
you learn a lesson, and then you find a lead.
alright.
not until i have some good news.
you are the quizno's.
do not.
i think you need to confess... ...the fact... what are you doing?
why is he even here?
would you excuse us... he has not changed.
there he goes.
pam, could you please tell darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
eleanor rigby?
i would welcome it.
pam.
okay, all right.
it is a death sentence.
they are caveman.
but i do want to talk to you about something.
go get your own thing.
you know what, i feel like one of those old timey sailors.
ah, what is hanging?
can you believe it?
maybe they have something against living forever.
do not break the branches, dwight.
ok. this is the last <i>thing</i> that phyllis needs to see right now, dwight.
oh honey... he is funnier than me.
by any means necessary?
phyllis, our resident senior.
dwight schrute here.
she had a hysterectomy.
scram.
that is perfect.
everyone stop wiggling!
i did not really wash my hands.
oh my god.
okay, sounds great.
you should remember that.
thank you.
you have to be honest, here.
right here!
boy, you clean up good.
i want to remind everyone the true meaning of christmas.
they, no.
big butt, bigger heart.
will you help her find them, please?
good, there is something i would like to show everybody.
if you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
yes, listen, um...  you cannot tear stanley from his family like this.
you will have pam to answer to.
but the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is january but the brain needs a heart, and that is me again.
i do not think i did.
something that is been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes.
it is not going to take her 10 minutes to fax it, jim.
hey, hey, hey!
i am a person.
yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots.
hey, you.
so, it is still an upgrade.
okay.
so, you are fine with me not leasing the tractor?
i emerge victorious!
it is the people.
that is a conflict of interest.
yee-haw!
come on.
hey.
I am being misogynistic.
come on, stanley!
no, it... yes, okay, right.
that is metallicy.
i have to fire someone today, okay?
i will get out.
it is a hazmat suit.
you could ask for an extension.
aah!
jim?
well- it is- that is different.
she loves to sue, loves lawsuits.
because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
no!
i mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion... right.
i just know that i am flying high and i do not even want to think about it.
anytime.
facial type: marsupial.
thank you!
okay.
hello!
hey.
would you like to go to lunch with me?
hey, michael.
if a car hit me, it would not crack my pelvis.
that is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
here.
remember how hot she was?
come here, doggy.
i could tell, from the body language.
we should should kill him.
all right.
good work cookie monster.
okay uh, huh.
it is like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "hey, man, i love you this many dollars worth." no, do not!
now, who likes dane cook?
yes.
seven.
please let go.
retail consumer habits is...  the only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings.
how did that work out?
pacific ocean.
as has darryl.
yes!
and given our history, i need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
nobody needs your help.
you did?
ok, i am going to count down from five.
question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
why?
yeah probably.
you know what, if i had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be mr. "outside hire." yeah.
coming through.
bye... bye.
you should call him!
I am not buying it a fur coat.
get rid of it.
probably should not have mentioned buffalo.
a good manager has got to be hungry.
you know what this is?
you have had your drink.
angela, you are up.
oh, god.
shhh... i know that you are probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
who is that guy?
looks serious.
a sensitive email has been released to the office.
sit.
how are you?
is that a sumo suit?
why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?
well you know what, where is my golden shower, phyllis?
sorry, too busy can not even come to the door.
oh, you have got to be kidding me.
because i... i do not know if it is...  whup!
yeah.
grasp wrist as such.
gotcha.
look at that.
three words.
no, but i -- oh, no.
it is a joke, dwight.
i just want to say that i have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble.
we had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why did you have to go off and die?
hello everyone i am sure you have seen the item in the journal.
seventy, eighty, one, two three.
ryan, obviously the best.
stanley,  terribly nice guy.
ok, dwight grab your stuff, we are going to new york to party with ryan and to meet girls.
look they got pillows.
i went with the people i thought would put the best face on the company.
you are not going to.
how is the new boss?
then i realized that i was being silly.
it was something else.
okay, what are you deciding?
why would dwight do that for you?
i do not know, make something up.
he got us nothing.
let us go on a little walk.
ok. good.
no, kevin does not have an elephant heart.
i want you to take jim's chair.
wow.
to show them that we are not above them.
i would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
of course.
can you whisper it in my ear?
no.
yeah.
and we widen to reveal ancient rome.
never.
mmhmm.
can i do some of the talking?
and if this does not bother them, then i am out of ideas.
okay.
well, well.
ryan.
okay, everybody come on.
nnnngah!
so I will come get you before the table-making demonstration.
...jim.
so i can lower it.
of course we will clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
if you say screw you one more time... hey, hey.
I am going to make you look like lebron james!
they are my subordinates.
that marriage would be a sham.
you are incorrect.
no, we are not.
hey, you are making me spray!
w-i do not understand.
smells pretty bad, does not it?
to sort of get closure on that whole thing.
uh huh.
no time!
i think this feast is over and it is time to go to the hospital.
no!
no, i feel it is my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
settling.
oh, oh, i see angela.
woody your favorite character?
what is so funny?
just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want.
peepee?
i do not want to chip my mug.
ah!
it was hard.
did some research.
i just do not understand why i was not even interviewed for the job.
funtivities!
big day for you.
okay, sweetie, no.
but i am, i am human, right?
her kid needs shoes, jim!
get out.
because we have lost a member of our family and you do not want to talk about it, you do not want to think about it, you just want to get back to work!
yeah.
phyllis, think fast.
hello again, naughty nostrils.
well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
um, no, no.
everybody settle in.
hey jim-bag.
it is by the tenderloin.
ok. fine.
i think it is crazy the coach will not play him frankly.
they come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you have ever seen.
and that person is  deangelo!
thank you.
can not we all just get along?
<i>false</i>.
here is a certificate.
oh man.
oh, you are right, i can not hold on.

just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
no, no.
may i hold him?
she does not hold a candle to you, erin.
this is going to be awesome.
jim, jim, jim, jim, jim, jim, jim.
look jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.
great.
wrong.
ha- this man is an imposter!
pam-pam!
please let go.
this  why would somebody throw that out?
we will have to talk- just amongst ourselves.
ok... merry christmas.
awards, multiple dundies.
ugh, what?
it is like another seven hours.
uh, got to love the 'bucks.
so i spend most of my time right here.
i feel like you are in a suicide cult.
i just found out today.
boom!
wow.
the same amount of work is done, whether i am here or not.
leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door.
please stop.
that look?
i got nothing cooking, it is cooked.
of course it was you.
it is all spilling over the edge.
no, what I am saying is... no, that is not it.
that is it.
jesus christ.
i am attacking myself with a throat punch.
it is one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
no.
who is next?
i was shocked when i found out.
look at him.
people here have been saying that I am a j. crew model.
yes!
she has a good point.
i will tell.
all right?
hello?
come on man, that is disgusting dwight!
all right?
martin went from being a new guy from stamford... to a convict, to... my friend.
all right.
I am not firing anyone.
as his right-hand man, it is my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
oh, I will be fine.
where is creed?
that is a lucky number.
well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
what is going on?
we had a very truncated rehearsal time.
could i?
hot-dog fingers.
come on.
have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses?
pam wishes.
here is a plaque.
classic gang only.
i believe in us.
no.
um, yeah, no, well... i mean better.
oh, my god.
ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
thank you.
no.
which one is that again?
i just got a call from debbie brown over at the mill.
get it over with.
oh, yuck!
hi, darryl, come out here, please.
no, tats.
just talking about you.
that phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
or do you <i>know</i>?
ungh, this is not looking good pam!
he is just being stupid.
you know what?
thanks for coming in, that is always... always helpful when i give him a call.
courtesy of dunder mifflin.
i guess we are back to normal.
ha.
fine.
I am just thinking about what you said, about karen, about closure.
and your affiliation with cornell - will end completely!
yes, yes.
god.
this is totally unprofessional.
that is what... let us do it!
we did it?
la telefona.
hr stuff?
okay, um, oscar, I am going to need to take another advance on my salary.
let me show you the compost pile.
"michael, buy a motorcycle." so i put the money in my shoe, and then i forgot about it until now.
no, i did not.
i am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
what is so funny?
all right.
and totally against the spirit of christmas.
we are very excited too, are not we guys?
nothing but gruel.
do not look at me people.
so i could tell them apart.
I am sorry.
jo, i do not know how things work in florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
oh.
i take spinning classes three times a month.
likes me a lot.
downsizing?
man-boy!
I am going to see a friend in a play called sweeney todd.
good work today, everybody.
write it yourself.
well, i guess i did not score and I am not sure who is actually shooting, but, whatever.
oh, most honorable pamera.
listen temp.
dwight, i would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
i was like, 'oh, i guess I am a loser.
mercy is for girl-babies.
nothing.
brought you some balloons.
we have, in front of you here, seven different types of pennsylvania top soil.
i think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or i will do it for them.
pam, pros.
okay.
maybe.
pick another one.
okay, he remembers toby, the most forgettable man in the known world.
need i remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
hey.
thank you.
what does he say.
hey, mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, brunch!
yeah shhh... i... that was just... i was breathing.
no, no.
how do i apply?
i would love that.
I have been trying.
yeah.
and i want it to be oscar-specific.
that is good.
I have achieved plenty and there is no better than the best.
why?
abraham lincoln once said that, "if you are a racist, i will attack you with the north." and those are the principles that i carry with me in the workplace.
no, damn it!
we found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when stanley had his... when his heart went berserk.
i love you, angela.
shampoo.
ladies and gentlemen, may i present to you for the first time as a couple, mr. and mrs. bob vance!
what do you expect me to do?
no, no, no.
oh, my god!
great.
ok. alright, after you.
uh... i can not really hear you.
sorry!
not in a thousand years, catherine.
oh, my god.
i might be gone... three hours.
we are in a stairwell.
well, it does not...  oh my god!
speaking of rainbows, oscar... you are kind of a double minority.
this is extremely urgent!
growing up, i performed my own circumcision.
not on angela's boob.
okay, um, there was a girl from dunder mifflin.
these things seldom work out.
we are going down, right now.
mega-desk.
want to head back?
yeah, i am.
you know what jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
all right.
what?
why do not you just resign?
or melons.
ha ha ha!
michael!
that is good.
you should... floss.
you know, because i care about this project.
get in!
do you have anything for that?
i did not order a stripper.
i feel good.
never mind.
no, we can not.
of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the scranton branch butts.
ah!
I am the one who suggested that you fire him.
do not be an idiot.
so, you should just suggest that to him and he will be sure to give you a raise.
okay, okay.
incorrect.
that is why we got to catch him.
please.
I will stall  them.
yours does not.
attention everyone.
allow me to demonstrate.
more than a friend, a co-worker.
we have gone down the wrong path many many times.
classic.
oh my god!
i can not... this is why I am a volunteer sheriff's deputy and you are not.
wow.
just go into gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she will be happy for hours.
what am i supposed to do?
oh!
i am not going to give up that easy.
you were playing too.
night erin.
crazy.
one... two... three.
basher, thrasher, crasher and-- smasher?
if you want to dump me, i totally get it.
nice to meet you.
no, i need the k- we have to go.
wait a minute.
that is what we have been looking for.
saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony.
can you confirm that the straps are tight?
you yelled at me.
say it again.
great.
what were you talking about in there?
i do not, i do not think I am ready.
party central!
what do you want?
i think the meetings are very important.
hmm?
stop talking.
well, gee, jim, i do not know, i guess there is no sales call today.
no.
i know, i know, i know, I am sorry.
right.
okay, all right.
waa... what?
oh my nose so itchy, why is my nose so itchy!
and then prey on their emotions.
holly flax from the nashua branch.
you think you would have done better without me?
today is the hardest i have worked in a long, long time.
hi, carol.
jim it is okay.
so um... i think I am going to go back with darryl  okay.
you need to come by your sales honorably!
I am going to get it.
ok you know what?
besides my shirt tail covered most of it so... that is not gross, it is the human body.
i can not get out of it!
oscar.
ok, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I am going to have you all in tears.
jim.
you have to break the interior bag.
yeah.
thank you.
narc!
... that is not appropriate, no.
i think an alliance might be a good idea, you know.
she goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in malibu.

earlier today.
oh, ok.  why did not you call me?
hey!
yes, i am sure, jim.
hey, captain jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
i mean I am in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you are in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
yeah, oh, and here is your expense receipts right there.
...  it is a million-dollar sale.
come on, come on.
no.
okay, great.
it is really the greatest day of all time.
good to see you.
do not... yeah, i went hunting once.
you do like hard boiled eggs and i got one a those melon ballers  and i, it is just like a little ice cream scoop, and i just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.
koselli.
well, i think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
that is the fun of this place.
not important.
where are we going?
a customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.
thank you.
humbly taking your hand upon which i kiss to show my contrition.
he is not a big fan of me dropping by announced.
go!
yeeesh.
and it does not need to be clean.
ok, yes that would be bad.
come on in.
did i truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment?
poor little guy.
everyone would go to one santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she would ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." at which point the kgb would arrest you and send you to siberia.
we are counting on ya.
what is the matter with you?
tell us about your divorce.
and disarm now!
today is the first day of sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores.
michael scott.
okay, I am going to need to search your car.
carmel dip.
thank you, mr. springsteen.
everybody hates me.
we are getting rid of everything that reminds you of carol.
i say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension.
get out!
we only have a few weeks left.
and held him for ransom.
and i nevah got caught, neither.
you are welcome.
you looked freaked, man.
something less offensive?
do you have a minute?
all their top clients i can not believe it.
come on!
go ahead.
I am not seeing anything under "confirmation." could it be under "affirmation?" because you have thousands of those.
can you dump it on a woman?
no, not that, by itself.
hey, guys.
what can i do to make it more perfecter?
this is scott.
he just totally lost it.
very good michael.
i am going to give you a little blast from the past of michael gary scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'fundle bundle.' okay?
well, well, well.
i am your boss and i may someday be your father, so get out.
that is ridiculous.
sure.
ok everybody.
so, what can i do you for?
it is really happening.
well... that is my watch.
i just hope i find it along the way.
are we all set?
get out and face me like a man!
secret santa, let us go.
just lice pam?
merry christmas, little children!
oh, hey temp.
shut up.
say it.
a la, tonight we will be hosting at louie volpies!
fine.
hmm.
um, sort of a spy, thriller... thanks, no, i have work tomorrow morning.
except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because i have started my very own paper company right here in the building.
yes!
she will know what it means.
i suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand.
i mean- do you ever wrestle with each other?
when the leaves change.
of course i saw it.
and her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
i just want to hang out, just be one of the guys.
let us get back to work.
i think i made that very clear in the fliers, fun, f-you-n. well, i think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
yeah.
you guys think prison is so great?
if luck were not involved, i would always be winning.
show me that farm.
ready to play some games?
this is going to feel so good, getting this thing off my chest.
mmm... nah, that is too young.
let us go, go, go, go, go.
that is a great way to kill this party.
well, we know that toby thinks she will be great.
no i will not!
well, that figures.
ten minutes of silence honoring michael jackson.
matchmaker!
do you have your card?
because um I am not nervous in front of them.
are you going to believe that?
i do.
tri-managers.
i hit a deer with my car.
michael!
leave it, i mean it.
I will tell you this, it is <i>not</i> because of the boob job.
but once i did it, i did not look back.
okay.
the least you can do is be there for him now.
well i do not know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
there are basically two schools of thought-- bears do not-- what is going on-- what are you doing?!
yeah.
i have to run to my car to take a dump.
you should not rush into this.
yeah.
that is horrible!
there is always a distance between a boss and the employees.
da  na na na na.
meh, exactly.
blow.
have a seat.
go on.
so how you holding up?
i love you, meredith.
no, no, no.
can you?
i know.
here we go.
yes.
listen, when i saw you talking to erin earlier, i noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I am assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
and if somebody were to be bait it would be jim.
this is my pledge to you.
hey, toby.
shh!
i did.
in the office right now as we speak.
let us meet at 4:00 pm at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
do you understand what we are about to do?
ah, just the stupid leads.
i love you, kelly.
here we go!
diabolical plan?
dammit.
like the movie, mean girls.
if the salad is on top, i send it back.
oh, dat wir be fwar.
wait a second, do people often say they are going on sales calls and then go someplace else?
they inherit things through the breast milk.
jim!
the cake has spoken pam.
yes i was.
well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but i do not see them so i think we are good.
where is the line, january no, I have seen the video.
let me float something out there, okay?
and the talent agent says, "describe your act." and the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "what do you call yourselves?" and the man says, "the aristocrats!" i mean truly repulsive acts.
but not like this.
you said it!
no.
how are you?
where do we go folks?
yup.
what do you do with a drunken sailor?
where do i go?
right?
final answer!
the book all the president's men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.
come on, give me something good!
kelly, i want you to do makeup.
i know exactly who he is.
i love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved.
yeah, great!
what is happening?
i just want what is best for you, mo chuisle.
ryan.
and I would like you to take a look into the face of rabies.
you got to get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it.
okay, I am going to wrap it up here.
well we are not going to put out stumps, come on.
i mean who are we, the girl scouts?
no.
oh come on.
i think that she is a fast learner.
yes!
because i do not think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart.
oh god!
probably not.
you know, not what this is about.
you can hear me, but i can not hear you.
berp.
I am going to frame mine.
andrew, what about you?
i know.
he can not fire all of you.
or ryan.
can you tell me now where paper comes from?
it is not a sex ed class.
okay, can you tell the manager that I am keeping his delivery kid until i get a discount on the eight pizzas i ordered.
show of hands!
"sorry i did not write back sooner; i can not go to the game tonight because my boss michael is an ass and making me stay late."  well, stanley's an ass.
yeah.
when did he tell you?
yes.
you will get there.
well, what can you do?
that is it?
huh, huh, huh!
okay guys, thank you for the offers.
he will call back though.
because i like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
i respond to strong leadership.
thanks.
pam, show's just getting started.
can you leave?!
catchphrase: "my horn can pierce the sky".
okay.
because you are invited and you are invited and you are invited and you and you and you and you and you and you- what?
oh come on!
it rained.
and it blows.
come here.
if they are good ideas, I am not going to say no!
wait, wait, wait, no, i mean, if you need to know more, you can call david wallace.
what do you think?
ahh!!
it was fun.
but also upper middle management.
okay.
it was only five dollars.
you are not faggie.
but a pledge?
and this is not even a cell phone.
one of our many recent good deeds?
there is a lot of choices.
and they do not grow back the same way.
ladies and gentlemen, mr. david wallace!
i can not take it anymore.
just stab  them on in there.
i... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.
is there anything i can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for dr. shaundry?
and we have begun.
oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
wow, i feel like a human juicebox.
the most important one of the guys.
the second was to find a memorable souvenir for philip.
he is here on a special work program.
he needs to lift me.
yeah, no such thing.
mighty worker.
i believe his tissue has made me stronger.
it is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
alright.
ok. did everybody get one of these?
let us follow the chain of events.
fine.
it was playful hazing.
there were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and i grabbed one.
I am a little busy.
what did you do?
no friends, dead end job.
these bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
I have taken my downstairs office and i have turned it into a place to hang out.
there are new rules.
god.
pam.
what?
like a taxicab?
a man you have missed with all your heart.
but he is also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he is ready to explode.
that is a dog.
that has pejorative connotation.
now dweedle dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem.
nothing.
one thing you need to know about me.
mmhmm.
you can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
well, yeah, yes.
coolio.
you know, dwight, there was a time when you would be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
are you sure?
seal it off.
sure.
you are?
he had to follow his heart!
you would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
no problem.
bye-bye.
rule violation.
not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.
yes, exactly!
no.
ok, ok... stanley, your team name?
i got a pumpernickel just for you.
look at what you are wearing again, pam.
no, it will not be.
that is japanese for california roll.
what did you get?
no, i was looking online about sebaceous cysts.
now.
you have tv in the joint?
yeah, but now his heart is in thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.
ryan is being a little bitch again.
toby!
pam, stand up.
you are welcome.
if you think that is going to have any effect on me, it will not.
game over.
you are an angel.
queer eye.
we will get somebody to clean that up.
come on, man.
that is fantastic.
oh, how much does it hurt?
I am going to set your face on fire.
that is a toboggan, you never know when you are going to find a snowy hill so... every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and pam is my hot roadie.
just kidding.
i know that we need to cut costs.
no, it is more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.
three!
what you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that is been said is untrue, including "stanley is having an affair." it is like the end of spartacus.
thank you.
and jan is thinking about downsizing either the stamford branch or this branch.
hey!
nobody is nobody's bitch.
okay.
i love you, new york!
you did these... freehand?
you guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.

it may be the person you least suspect.
just do it, okay.
that is good.
no.
the pack is back!
okay, what is it, what can not i guess?
jan, hello.

it takes an advanced sense of humor.
ok. fine.

it is paper.
piece of cake.
why?
you are dead.
uh, i may need some immediate assistance.
and I am going to find that person and punish them.
the twirl sucks.
you want to hit me, you want to punch me?
horrible person.

no.
dwight, you ignorant slut.
and that is all i needed; I am good.

well... you are...you know what?
they invited me to come here today.

I am just lucky i got out.
um, yeah, i was just um, i just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the chili's.
and you will reply, "i do."  and then he is going to ask angela if she would like to marry andy, to which you will reply... and there we go.
i do not mind if i do.

you know what?
i still have my old phone.
jesus.
those can not be my scores, jim.
what is pam doing chatting with you?

wondering if i could, uh, get your help for something.

that?
nice to meet you.
i mean, i can wait till then.

what is going on?
i was wrong.
hey right, i have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.

it is only meredith.
oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let us do it.

I will be right back.
somebody hurt?
how many offices are there?
what the hell is going on?
okay.
you are taking this out on me, but i was only the messenger.

i think it is talking and being friends, and jim thinks it is moving to connecticut and being best friends with josh.
45 days to get us back on track.
discussed movies.
angela?
tonight has been one crazy night.
and i would survive.
pam's a solid seven.
angela, no!
well, i just like to look good ok, so -- no, i am just coming out myself.
I am coming michael!
and there is a special secret prize for the winner!
and dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly i have misjudged you from the beginning, and i apologize.
but it is an even bigger day for me.
it is, uh,  excuse me.
you have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which i hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
post hole digging.

it is a tribute to one of the greats... mr. adam sandler.
let us get down to some wine drinking.
you know, jim, those are just words.
sounds... fun.
oh, let us fix you up.
i saw someone breaking the law and i interceded.
but i have to consider pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker i can not in good conscience continue to date you, when i know what this is doing to her.
hey.
okay fine, i get it.
so after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, i have decided to make jim my new number two.
tape recorder.
and just bear in mind when i say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that i, if i were you, that i would not want to hear... well... no, I am not.
so it is true?

no.
you want in?
do not be a caricature kevin, never be a caricature.
wallace does know that you have been gone for the last three months?
jim!
you are probably going to get carded, so i can make you a fake id.
then the sun comes up and i head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.
you ready?
go ahead.
i might have gotten it after her.
i went through holly's things.

i can not believe i pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show.
so we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slo-mo, drinking latte.

well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you would like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I will use it as i would a wagon on my farm.
what the hell was that?
i could of- ok. yehhhehh.
but, I am, I am not like wham-bam.
how would you even know?
yes, i was quilled.
now i know what the founders of phillip-morris felt like.
who suggested cake?
this is disgusting.
i will do all the talking.
I am just saying... they would flank you.
"you are too slow, you are too small, seabiscuit is a stupid name." you guys sound just like the enemies of seabiscuit.
i do!
eeee.
i swore to myself that if i ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as i walked away.
oh, hello there.
so what are our options?
yeah!
it does not have to mean anything.
what shape?
so the monkey does the sex thing right here!
tonight, i can not do it tonight, no.
good.
but now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
it should not go all night long, so if you would like me to, i could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence.
you know what, hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why ryan fired him.
no... what happened?
you can count on me.
ryan!
i really do.
ask him if he remembers jim.
how do you know that?
no, no, no, no... ...no, no, no, no, it is not what you think.
hmm.
what port?
well, yeah, but you do not need the brochure.
it is not even a real snow.
who wants some munchies?
get this.
well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart.
i feel so weak, i just... what do you want me to do jim?
well, he, michael scarn, that character, orders people around, and that is, you should of just gone- well... i do not think there is any stronger choice than being a really strong character.
i wished for angela, a heart, and for kelly, a brain.
oh, hi friend!
due to a recent incident involving phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - i think you know what I am referring to - michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
so, i felt i needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and I am making him do my laundry for a year.
you will find something else and... awesome.
why do not i introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
listen.
really dead.
everybody who is going to go with me i want you to stomp your foot.
is that all you have on her?
yes, but you could tell me.
uh, that is so stupid.
no.
i tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the shoah foundation.
and i would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
other people's... something.
this is the way... i do not... okay, just listen.
a real hoop dreams story you got there.
so far, these are my leads.
after breakfast.
everybody, david wallace and i have talked and we have decided to promote jim to the position of co-manager.
i would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
pam, could we change something on this?
at first i drove myself crazy thinking about the things i should have done differently.
it would be like coyote ugly.
it is the most important position.
oh, god.
oh hey, i forgot something in my car.
well, deal with this.
so let us just do this.
what is that?
I am going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
so.
so older people have just as many rights as younger people?
andy just gave me a chain with three weak links.
okay.
because i know you like putting q-tips deep into your ear canal.
i insist.
yeah, well my feet do not.
the life of the party.
i never recommended you because i did not want to lose you and i did not want to lose pam,  and now i do not want to lose the baby.
you tried to break into the machine.
hello.
let us storm his castle!
you know what?
the new guys called a sales meeting?
yes, I would like to speak to your office manager, please.
we did not actually plan that.
you are not going to lose them.
I am a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
just kidding he would not be interested in any of you.
fyi.
.
she is a dental hygienist from carbondale and she makes love like one.
we got a live one!
who knows how to throw an outfit together.
all right.
so now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
that is like... I will call you, too.
why does not she just tell you what your schedule is?
the cop takes me away and tells me that I have been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall.
and, uh, i know everybody says this, but i-i want to remain friends.
dwight, dude, you got to take a chill pill, man.
check that one out.
oh, that is a good idea.
it is about to get all stupid up in here.
i usually love babies, but when i held astrid i just felt... shortchanged.
open your mouth.
all right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
are you kidding me?
damn it kevin.
hey guys.
here i am using it.
that is what we said last time.
with over 400 locations worldwide.
move!
tap deangelo out.
kelly, ryan looks great.
alright.
they should not be given the choice.
and I am here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people!
and i bought this condo to fill with children.
yep.
it is so intimidating!
who is side are you on?
oh, you say jesus is king of kings?
no, i have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats.
thank you... dwight.
hey, hey, hey!
how would one of you feel if i told you i could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
I am buying it and I am not renting it.
i mean, come on!
and in real life it is disgusting.
five strikes in a day equals a home run.
instant death.
i am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience.
good work, everybody.
i know your telling the truth.
what is this contraption, i do declare?
what did you do to it?
in the end.
that is dangerous.
you know, there is something interesting about me you might want to know.
so I am just going to have my soft pretzel, then I will get to work, and I will be super productive.
i was eventually going to get around to my dream!
i, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
i saw your-your sign outside.
or is it?
is he alright?
sorry to interrupt.
because they always have yams.
yes.
hey, you are going to, going to hurt yourself.
good.
okay!
this is delightful, charming culture.
why do not, why do not i take you out to lunch?
and, um, it is uncomfortable.
mmm-hmm.
jell-of!
alright .
i just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving pda or public displays of affection.
margaret the land lady?
i can not wait to be a father.
can we have the room please?
oh.
well, okay... so it is mine, and it is not somebody else's, so... i know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so... you did?
i auditioned for this.
he and i came up together as salesmen.
come to reason with me?
my weekend was bad so far.
uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids.
hello, dwight.
well there is two things actually.
hello, dwight schrute?
not just because he said it?
shut up, or I am going to punch you in the throat!
devon was one of my best buddies.
grr!
uh-huh.
okay.
we all know that you probably thought that pam was too "meh" or thin without being toned.
no, no.
it is a cemetery.
how about, uh, fine arts?
kay.
i got shotgun.
yes?
hey, oscar!
so we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 dundie awards.

oh, yes.
and i am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.
hell , rock 107.  am i the 107th caller?
say it.
what a nice guy.
i do not think she is going to make it.
i mean what is the point?
shh.
justin polznik!
alright, I am ready here.
"... to remain friends.
who is, uh... who is next?
the worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it.

i say that is crazy.
he leaves work, he is on his way home... wham!
all right.
i love ohio.
alright.
okay, okay, we are... okay, we are starting over.
this office is the american dream.
what bar?
i can use this for so many nuts!
my father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life.
may i?
but then there is this new guy.
i saw it in a movie.
right over here, let me show you this.
come on!
can i... can i just do it please?
listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper?
i will.
hello, we are warehouse workers.
somebody get him!
thanks, i had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there was not a concussion.
um... walking out of the room unexpectedly.
not yet, give it time.
oh my god.
that is a bit extreme.
i got her!
nice job, bill.
ye - ok, yes.
you know what?
answer the question.
all right.
i do not know.
on the other hand, i may have to deal with the dark unknown.
phyllis?
whass...up!
ha, ha.
that is what i thought.
no i get it.
but i love burlington coat factory.
we are going now!
look at his life!
ugh, that is so annoying.
you know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats catholics.
wear your wedding dress.

he is a friend.
let us keep it moving on.
jump.
right?
showing your colors.
it is a letter of recommendation.
she washes dogs.
c'mon!
really?
anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
a little friendly competition.
i will have seven first priorities.
so what did i miss?
yes, you may tell me one thing.
you had a rough night tonight.
why am i being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that i made?
what?
it is always you.
got to see how jamaicans live.
what can i do?
and i will see you there... burning.
now what you are feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... you are thinking, "am i good enough for this job?
stop.
three maybe, if you choose the pudding?
almost made it.
this is not dunder mifflin paper.
we had not even thought of that, had we boy?
and he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
like what?
i always... yes, i do.
well, let us see.
the hillary swank version.
oh, that is the muppet show, on dvd, classic.
i made it sterile.
just the woman I would like to see.
oh, here we go.
cornell is a good school, and i want to better myself through higher education.
all of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
you know me.
nobody?
um, guys, where you going?
oh!
oh really?
because, dwight... never lies.
was i, creed?!
i can give you an extra laptop battery.
and i just do not think corporate is going to go for this right now.
jim, dwight, andy and stanley.
that is just absurd.
during that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade lsd from the military.
no!
silly me.
n-no there is not.
could you tell  them that?
all good suggestions.
it was unanimous, toby.
... how much?
I have never lost a fight.
oh!
you okay?
you expect to be buttled?
she totally got me.
the only thing I am worried about... is getting a boner.
and we need to stop him.
... aww, that... sucks, great.
mm-hmm.
oh, we do.
now i want everybody to take a look to their right.
that is because i just threw it in the ring.
exactly.
you know, just for fun.
it is a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
this guy used to steal sales from us; now, he is going to steal sales for us.
i am not giving up.
yes, yeah, absolutely.
and it is all inclusive.
no it is not, not like penis-wise.
it was- ok. this is what it was.
conflict!
because you have great ideas.
uh-uh.
anything else would be inconsistent.
I am waiting for a text update.
but i thought that you were exactly awesome.
it is still stinky.
who is ready to work?
yes you did.
more of a, barbaric growl.
pam, jim, kevin, stanley.
we are back in.
chain of command.
i do not know how.
well i believe in love at first sight.
who is doing a toast?
i need to speak to your scranton-area bureau chief?
oh.
newborns are slippery.
...with you.
'm' is for murder, 'p' is for... ...for phone.
i feel very blessed.
my main concern, should i have a safe word?
he would....fall down.
personal hero, cool new guy.
right.
uh... when i was ryan's age, i worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school.
oh, you are so bad!
look at that.
you know what, it was not just me.
let me see your teeth.
that is... ...kind of  maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
ok, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right?
i do not know.
hey david, this is michael scott.
um, alright.
dunder mifflin.
i want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me.
what?
we need some tunes, i think.
toby, everybody!
ah, much, ok. no, no.
it is with great honor and privilege that i announce to you that i have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.
what do you think, phyllis?
yes.
so.
here is the thing about those discount suppliers.
if in ten years, i have not had a baby, and you have not had a baby... twenty years.
where...  "from the desk of andrew bernard."  a note.
no, it is really dorky.
pam, could i have a word with you in my office?
you notice it.
uh, I am not a moron.
lacerated hand here folks.
six seconds, macgruber!
we call her rice-a-ronnie.
thank you.
tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by.
someone attack me.
how come you did not get me one?
i think, wow, i love my big brother.
ok, well i did not get the job in new york, but i got the real prize, domestic bliss.
tied to my desk.
david, i did not tell her.
see how it is done?
yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
here, I will be him, you be you.
and by the time i got out the pony was already in the truck.
ship.
oh, god!
well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism.
so, win/win.
all right!
dwight!
yeah.
yeah pretty much.
we cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
attention!
in my own words.
thanks, I am not mad at you anymore.
it is nebulose.
ooh.
no signs of life down here.
ahh... oh thank you.
gosh, jump to conclusions.
you know what, i am on a deadline here and just, okay.
what should we be working on while you guys are talking?
well, sometimes.
oh!
and jan and i are going as a couple.
it will be fun.
nice.
it knows!
nein.
maybe after i finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show.
oh.
really?
i know.
here we go.
nobody better try to stop me.
you know what?
no, no, no!
ow!
it is going to make some really good toilet paper.
okay, that is enough aqua net.
that is nice.
it is probably the best idea anybody has ever had.
...i do not hate it, i just do not like it at all.
oh pam.
why would i disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
i like the people i work with generally, with four exceptions.
fake jackie, boom!
hey kevin, you are a gambler right?
you know where you are going?
seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
as your leader and your friend, i sort of demand that you can all speak in public as i can... and did... twice.
take heed of.
it.
every morning.
seriously.
what?
do you want the raise or what?
yuck!
oh, that sounds awful.
what is the very very worst thing about prison?
oscar, got big plans tonight with- kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?
well this has been fun, pam.
nothing!
well, you know... maybe you should go to business school like ryan, then... then you would know what you are talking about.
I am putting together kind of a wish list.
we should look into that.
all six of my numbers, okay?
ladies and gentlemen, i present to you the dream team.
you cannot go wrong with a throat punch no, there is a defense for that.
this is where i saw that deer last week.
ok. alright.
what look?
so, the next call we get I would like you to smile.
whoo!
forgive my pants, they fell down.
it is important that this company celebrates its diversity.
okay.
three hours, wow.
ow, ow, ow, ow.
too expensive.
we are like peanut butter and jelly, do not you think?
yeah.
only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive.
oh... yes.
well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for michael g. scott.
you, you, you, you... who are you?
great.
well,  I have actually done a lot of thinking about that.
um, so I will talk to you later.
i just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
ahh, still lame.
phyllis!
only this time, where is michael?
thank you angela.
you are getting past it.
yes, about that.
hello.
no, no, no.
so, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
want me to get down on one knee and beg you or- what?
really?
you know, you have worked so hard for this.
let us just talk about you, as always.
he has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range.
i appreciate that, thank you.
turned out it was a conman copying charles xavier's school for gifted youngsters from the x-men comic books.
top of the morning to you!
remember clark.
but just know... if you ever lay a finger on phyllis, i will kill you.
yes.
hey, you know what?
death waits for no man.
say hi to pam.
yeah, way to go phyllis.
yeah, have a seat.
it belonged to my grandfather.
god!
da  na na na na.

let us do this thing!
come on.
ow, ow, ow.
I am your man.
it is alright.
flirt away.
thanks for coming in.
the big round things.
i have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place.
crazy stuff.
or... that is it.
this is nice.
what was that for?
I am not actually angry.
yeah, i guess it is not so bad.
if we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  "apology accepted", i think we would all feel better.
i thought they were all sold out.
pam, everybody!
fruit.
let him know you are not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down.
yeah?
lake erie.
yes.
ok, excuse me.
toby is leading ours upstairs.
that is right.
you look at her... and she is kind of matronly today, but back in high school, i swear, her nickname was 'easy rider'.
bare my child.
another announcement.
look at that one.
oh, that is appropriate.
then do it anonymously.
yes we do.
ask me.
contractually we are obligated to have sex.
you said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
a guy on a train with no answers.
well, you know what phyllis?
thanks.
oh, okay.
first you jump ship.
mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone?
robert parrish!
go!
oh give me a break.
not a good idea to say that to a woman however.
yes, yes, right away.
this is it.
padded bra.
i know a great taxidermist.
hi, sorry about that.
shove it through!
and you already know dunder-mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway.
noon.
so, uh, what is the 411?
look at that.
he sometimes wears glasses, write that down.
uh-huh.
it was an accident.
dunder mifflin, a great place to work!
well, that is what scranton is all about.
with sex.
my cousin mose told me a joke.
and the future... is me.
what is wrong?
and this is the foreman.
a real man swallows his vomit when a lady is presentaEUR  hey.
get your free pancakes.
no, it is free during the day.
wrong.
except there is no grass out there.
okay!
i want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier.
one of these buttons is -- damn it.
wrong!
just this once?
where did you find him.
so have a great long weekend.
in the schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others.
it is like, come on, people, enough.
people do not just fall off of ladders.
in the islands, they do not make you do stuff like take inventory.
let us just knock this out right now.
tell me what you really think.
i thought of that.
now, let us discuss precipitation.
no guests today.
do we save accounting?
dragging sticks.
fun fact.
not that guy who murdered his mother.
I am captain jack sparrow.
yeah!
so, i forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this... one other thing i wanted to... ohh...nah.
I have taken some... I am just going to put this over there.
ah, roy's accepting.
i did.
I am hungry.
awesome!
deck the halls with crappy gifts... yeah, except for cheating on your wife.
check your pulse rate.
ho-ho, man!
great.
be right out!
stanley, could you come with me, please.
m-hmm.
distractions are good!
convoys are really fun.
who else?
downsizing?
that means ye, plop!
I am a little confused.
four!
oh, nicknames, yay!
hup!
the thing is... i thought bug's life was better, much better.
it is a lullaby.
<i>alien</i>.
or am i going on three?
that is inappropriate, kevin.
scranton!
yes, well about some things, and other things i am very stupid.
because ryan says so?
and i want what i want.
alright, dwight out!
I am just an extraordinary piece of crap.
everything's a joke.
oh no, that is too bad.
oscar dusting.
brain food.
there.
and this is everybody's favorite day.
i did!
hmm?
is that like the robot?
um, for instance, i learned the pledge of allegiance by setting it to the tune of old macdonald.
why do not you come by?
okay, email accounts.
all right.
you know, i would like to try the luge, through.
check your hair!
is that what you want to hear?
cynthia, also married.
so we know which truck to van... yeah.
it is $1.99 to finish the article.
i changed it.
okay, that is weird.
like candy from a baby!
mmm-hmm.
and this is not a joke.
jim and dwight shrupert.
he opened it like an ape.
yes?
okay.
this is michael scott, scranton, well we do not want to work.
it was one joint in the parking lot.
getting.
ok, how is my voice now?
i know you did.
all right, let us go.
of course.
and that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
I will take one too.
walk out of the house... ...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine.
i can prove it, watch this.
it could be done out of hate.
you still do not understand how this works.
sorry.
push it!
yes!
all i want to be is santa.
to think that a man's skin could turn on him.
jim, instead of e-mailing amazon, to try and get that cd that you did not receive, i suggest that you go to visa and tell them to cancel the charge.
i have risked a great deal to tell you this information.
no, you are.
put 'er there.
use that as an inspiration.
you know what?
he is happy because he is insane.
you are going to love  them.
okay, calm down.
ok.  oui.
do i have a choice?
and it feels good.
why?
hey, january this party is going to be awesome.
I will take this.
and pancakes?
here is your knife.
she was cute.
i would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
there are shadows coming from two different directions.
be respectful, dwight.
pointless.
assistant team manager?
i hate it!
we had to come over right away, it is urgent.
oh.
that is great, because, you know, the paper industry's not going to last forever.
45 points.
you will learn, baby.
darryl, watch this.
also there will be no bonuses.
no, no, no.
no, what happened with donna?
ugh.
nate, reply the paper.
its business, not personal.
well, suck it up.
if my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt.
two forty five, behind the building.
and there is our smudgeness.
he is crazy.
can you breathe?
why are you just standing there?
i know you are the mastermind, but you are too stupid to do it by yourself.
i do not want to take credit for this, but roy and i were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices.
i will tell you why.
traitor.
i wear many hats but the one I am currently wearing is that of gracious host.
i am kerrigan from starcraft!
just-in time.
um... okay.
dwight.
when jan and i had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called "survivorman." and, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
plus i will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard.
michael.
it is like the firemen.
dwight!
when you know, you just know.
kgb.
that is... a psyche.
move to the exits!
and dwight is kramer.
is this mine or is this chili's?
that is tina fey from saturday night live.
so i, you know, an employee will go home, and he will tell his neighbor, "hey, did you get an award?" and the neighbor will say, "no man.
uncool, dwight.
it helps our because.
if it is stanley's, call the offices of james p. albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
let us give him a minute to settle in, shall we?
he/she/it throat rips.
should be.
no.
are you laughing at me?
strictly taboo.
yeah!
all grown up and no place to go.
i just um, i just want to let you know that i am going to go to your lamaze class tomorrow.
i do not need you to give me a history lesson.
yep.
ryan?
really?
he is just not tough enough.
he is a tv announcer for the eagles.
ok, you know what?
we have... a bat... in the office.
look, look, look.
let us go.
they say that laughter is the best medicine so stanley, you can throw away those pills.
right?
good.
angela.
snack foods!
if i were you... ...i would fire anthony gardner... ...before noon... ...to consolidate power.
you know why?
so these are pizza dogs, they are not pigs in a blanket per se.
good.
wow.
um... well, you guys, you know, I am the boss so... hey, hey... you guys believed me?
no, no, turn it around.
oh, you do?
myth: 3 americans every year die from rabies.
it is going to be fine.
I am going to kill myself, and it is your fault!
you even do so little as grant me an interview, i will guarantee you your dream work life.
you are fired like a heart attack.

you certainly seemed jealous when i told you about my fake girlfriend.
i was thinking maybe like a mixer.
man!
you look great too.

i lost ed truck.
i meant that as a compliment to you phyllis, as well as a slight to andy.
I am getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a hindu halloween.

on the street we did not have any rules.
be cool!
the dog or a fish?

pam i have a loaded gun in my desk at work.
i just, i need to know a little bit more about my friend.
you are going to learn to be more professional, luke!
uh... I have got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.

hi, i am well, how are you?
yup.
i got it covered.
so, jim is actually my friend.
and i will travel to new zealand.

he has a surprise.
do not ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what.
and the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter.
it bothers me.

thanks.
this is going to be funny!
no excuses erin, come on!

I am right.
i stole.
what is that?
oh, this does not look good.
jim, as a matter of fact, i have printed out ten ways to induce labor.
to give you a reference point.
the invalid.
of-kay.
I have never had one.
almost as much as i love pain.
as if you are trying to impress a much older man who is way out of your league.
here you go.
so the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
another day.
this is the dealio.
are you kidding me?
china has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars.
yeah, and you can not see her whole body.
well... what are you doing?
you do not know pam.
throw them away in the recycling bin.
ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift.
that is dwight.
maybe that- yes.
oh yes, i will.
oh, that is funny.
okay.
shall we proceed?
my greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ... i can not get it out.
mmm-hmm.
do you mind?
night everyone.
this whole delivery slash sales idea?
are you kidding me, that is who you are worried about?
this is an office.
jim should just call it "stumpany," for "stupid company." you are working for "stumpany" too?
it is very good for you.
can you give me a second, sir.
i stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
fine.
andale!

no, no, no.
stop.
and a chihuahua.
whom, whom... whom?
what do you think?
exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.
could i stay in your room tonight?
could have used some of that famous hispanic cleaning ethic.
and, believe me, i could have.
huh.
well get on it.
yeah, is that hard for you?
okay.
we came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
well... bleh busted.
he is not going to say any of that.
forget it.
pleasure.
i have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign.
the dundies!
thank you jim.
and you loom so large in my heart that i crossed the line.
nope.
thank you.
it could be a lookie-loo.
previously on varsity blues... hi jan!
it is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.
it is all good.
thanks.
no, i have not.

the best part about the internet, that video of the dancing indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e.
not in a speech.
do not break up you guys, you are great together.
because I am drunk, i can not even find her.
it is christmas eve-- --and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done.
everybody loves ping.
dinkin' flicka.
i got it.
this goes for all of you.
pam, just be professional.
is there anything accounting-wise i can do to sort of make it all go away?
dwight k. schrute" please.
but, they really seem to be enjoying it.
ohh.
I am not.
might want to run that by angela because it is so cute.
it was in a fancy store.
i just thought you should know that i was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at cumberland mills.
with fluffy little snowballs?
any nuns?
ahhh, dwight, may i have your chair please?
jim!
oh and i also built this table.
then i refuse.
white collar.
that is my white out.
about two more minutes .
just, I am fine.
this place... is like... the hospital where i was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
good economic sense.
you rich people.
angela said she was going to tell him.
no!!
jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
that is over several months, ryan.
i have anxiety all the time.
yes i do.
this is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive.
you have worked up quite a sweat.
right, that is good, good, pursue this.
yeah, you know me.
you have complained about everybody in the office, except dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with dwight.
well, at least you are still being honest with me.
oh, how did that happen?
okay.
so I am thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live.
no you ahh.
boom!
it happened this morning in the parking lot.
racial message?
did you get anything good?
city slickers.
nailed it.
no, criminals are like raccoons.
you had black hair and then gray hair.
no, this is romantic.
seductive.
I have been so good... please.
gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and meredith said she was interested and then gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket.
but most importantly we need to get her some medical attention.
hello sir.
the elderly suck the life out of the young.
there are very few things that would make me not want to team up with david wallace.
wait, what?
I am in an identical situation.
let me see if i have his cell.
la la la, hello oscar!
i was just talking so just go out there and say anything.
you have to agree with me.
i do not want a purse.
right, toby?
anything?
hey little girl, what would you like for christmas?
i need to find ways to push meredith to the bottom.
when i was in the sandbox as a kid, i got not respect.
these people are the best of the best.
it is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
oh, calm down, weirdo.
this young man needs to learn that is not how you treat people.
kevin file drawers.
you wanted the job, the job is yours.
god... damn it!
mimosa.
ow!
really?
wow, a thousand big ones.
open the gates!
this now i have an eye on.
that is not true.
they come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we are all gone, they jack up the prices.
ah!
nailed the joke.
behold!
hello.
woman in every port.
hoist his shank on three.
just pretend we are not here.
you are not his friend, you do not know.
i am better than this!
ok, let him know that I am here.
thank you for coming in.
good point.
so, i am going to... give her a ride home.
you have your lawyer there?
no, nothing like that at all.
they hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.
but is it the best management?
i do not understand when you all talk at the same time.
and by the way, i have not.
listen, scott... we are losing money, okay?
nick, i had a dream last night that i had two full time jobs.
I am going to read you a series of statements, and i want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.
andy.
plus i can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment.
ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. i am ready to start dating again.

so I am going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
here you go buddy, happy birthday.
alright, well- I will work on that- let us keep going.

call back again.
did you hear pam is pregnant?
there has been an accident on 84 west.
okay?
no mustard!
i told dwight that there is honor in losing.
you know, i would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
going to be very delicious.
yeah, we locked him up for two years.
do not move a muscle.
they have been sleeping together for some time.
okay, you are done.
yep.
voodoo mama juju... what am i going to do?
too much for me to have by myself.
the swat's arriving.
you know, i wanted us to be a team.
so she says 'fine.
well, okay, in a nutshell, what I am saying is... leadership.
who is side is toby on?
w-why did you... yes we should.
cheer or fear?
bingo!
i can save the branch.
the women, the pancakes, the man of mystery... meredith, i would like you to pretend that you are from abu dhabi.
second best bananas foster I have ever had.
we need to reopen this case.
i apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
but, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.
really pam, is that what you think of me?
I would accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
could have gone better i guess.
what the hell is going on here?!
watch this.
ow!
they have their own little language now.
oh come on, stop the fake prissy act.
oh...my god!
i hope it will fit, with all these little knickknacks.
come on, you are better than this!
no, friends only.
oh, that guy?
well, bigshot, 'if you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
right.
i do not care if it is pizza.
be serious.
let us just... why can not you just forgive... why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?
ok. alright, he is on his way up.
who is going to tell on us?
that sounds pretty biased.
hmmm, interesting.
and i know what glee is, I am a total gleek.
it is condescending.
well, he does not do very well under pressure.
let us do it to it!
how about never hundred hours, sir.
this is going to be good and everybody's going to come.
all right, so, on your mark, get set, go.
...and then i think I am going to go to the garlic festival.
hey, carol.
twelve hundred dollars for a stroller?
mmm mmm mm mm mm!
and the woman says "hey.
split the difference.
so, get excited.
i already made an appointment... with your secretary.
are you near sighted or far sighted?
i can not let you in, michael.
it is like, urine goes all over the place.
ahh!
and if we did, it would be with jim and pam.
you want my leads?
and... my question to you  is do you agree?
he is undercutting us big time.
maybe it is supposed to break all the rules.
god... damn it!
go pirates!
mine was green.
what did you-- yes.
right here.
looks like someone decided to dress up as old dwight schrute's mom.
can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running?
that is sort of one of the rules.
love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of january just call me levinson in the morning, baby.
and just to be sure, i asked her again afterward.
i, i surely do, and do not call me honey.
hey, hey.
i am looking forward to lunch.
i have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.
no way.
tie a shoe, toss a salad.

they take me away to prison.
god.
ah to be in your shoes.
you choose!
sign it.
something happened?
yes, that is me.
dunder- they,  well, okay i see security is coming so i just want to say, come to dunder mifflin.
all those sucker branches can suck our fat!

i am totally serious.
oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance.
dwight!
how about a clear signal, right?
yeah!

check this out.
respectfully, i do not want us walking into a similar angela kind of situation.
pam!
no, i did not intentionally get you drunk.
so many to choose from.
okay, let me try this one.
yes.
do you know a joke?
there ya go.
what right does jim have to claim authority, hmm?
and this... is a hassenfass.
you know what, I am going to leave you with one other thought.
exactly.
what if she brought her "partner" in to work?
what do you think?
also, it is not your real family.
david wallace would know what to do.
yes.
i do not know about that.
pam, put that in my good idea folder.
a lightbulb.
just a notch above toby.
i do not want to get ahead of myself, but i think i want her to meet my mom.
I am michael scott.
oh wow.
we met in a shoe store.
ryan and i have the majority of shares.
i hope you have been paying your wig storage bills jimbo, because it is time for another episode of "handsome and stinky, paper brothers for hire".

hey.
i will run this branch, or i will destroy this branch, or...  i do not know.
idiot.
even though i only went number one.
on my go... now!
yeah, what about those leads?
but i think you should just know that i am going to be giving her a ride home later.
it is two p.m. from now until four, your priority is knitting.
phyllis!
here we are ladies and gentlemen.
what she actually said was,  "what is with him?
jack blaise.</i> by far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie.
andy?
that is great.
where are they?
i already know what i am going to spend this on.
you know what.
in an ideal world, i would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
and you can not work for it.
then i will.
why do not you hold out your hand.
I am sorry.
shut up about the farm.
but you will... you will know it when you see it.
i like his hair.
yes.
an office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... an office is a place where dreams come true.
yeah, ok.  well, he only gets better.
my dream vacation?
no.
ho!
yes.
yeah... i could.
what is that letter, right there?
england is number two.
we are circling it.
you are not a veterinarian.
what... all right!
they are a family owned business .
this entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order.
you are sleeping with me.
I will kill you.
really?
now, go make your hands rough with work.
yes, yes.
we are laughing at phyllis, but she is not even here, so no harm, no foul.
maybe i just feel bigger.
but, at the end of my life, when I am sitting on my yacht, am i going to be thinking about how much money i have?
wait, wait- listen guys, one more point and we play corporate.
sounds good.
charger?
oh, my gosh, well... listen, oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale.
well, it was not much of a fight, actually.
michael, no!
yeah.
huh?
women can do anything.
good good.
that... your gut reaction is to say that, but i do not!
i hope the war goes on forever and ryan gets drafted.
and by green, i mean money.
good.
and after that, nobody ever messed with the 'damn rascals' ever again.
i have ordered that that  be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
that will be all.
i wish todd packer was here because he would love this.
imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand- oh, okay.
you are making some very dangerous assumptions oscar.
okay, alright.
when i am irritated and i look at you, i do not see you anymore.
yeah.
i started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope.

by 2020, they are going to be the world's largest economy and they are getting a taste for protein.
mm-hm.
we said "surprise." you were, like, "what?" "what the hell's going on here?" good cake.
have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
do you want to do that?
you think it is easy?
one person chooses a gift.
so, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
because I am the boss.
people are starting to notice how terrible jim is.
and there are clouds.
i love pain.
hi dwight.
in fact, i feel like part of what I am getting paid for here is my loyalty.
listen, david, i would like to do this ad in house.
check please.
do you want to talk about?
can not a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they will owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?
darryl, i did not walk out in the middle of yours.
horrible.
you are going to mess with me, is that what you are going to do?
genghis khan could take  them both down because he is not afraid to kill children aEUR  what?
alright?
that is not going to happen.
back and forth.
that is so great about the bonus!

I have never- i do not know him.
I will call her later.
aw, come on!
in the schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents.
i grew up on a farm.
you really expect me to believe you have not set a date?
whoa.
and then i went home to my condo.
if dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance.
i did so well last february that corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
who else?
i have work to do.
and this desk.
okay.
per diem.
so i do it.
what do i write?
and the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
oh d. oh d. we had already applauded.
how many of you can say that you love going to work every day like bavon?
i... he is hot, all right?
absolutely.
please do not listen to this boob!
I have never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
and i may come down and fire you if you do not do your job."  but what were talking about when we first kissed?
oh no, my child!
so let us go!
bat!
andrew bernard.

government-created killer nanorobot infection.
oh!

look... at... this... face.
so I am going to need you to give me the password to jim halpert's computer.
let us just size each other up here and left side of the list... attack!
no way.
ow!
we do not blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions.
no, no, hear me out.
i am not paying for that membership.
wow, i do not want to hear... you talk.
who wants for 400- do i see somebody in the back?
after all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
how is it going?
no!
and then you push some more.
300 going twice.
let us not speak of that.
they are into style.
that is funny.
no, i got it.
those are like seventeen feet high.
classic brosnan.
okay.
that is what I am saying!
show her.
ok, I am going to ask you something and i want you to be honest.
grunting is scientifically proven to add more power.
you took that with you.
i stepped in.
well, that is all baltzer gladfielder had and no one eats owls for thanksgiving.
now, i know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we have got chewing gum.
okay!
okay, alright.
this party is actually a really big step for us.
look at those wrinkles.
i taught jim and dwight everything i know about sales.
god!
well, in his infinite wisdom, david wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of dunder mifflin.
thank you very much.
yeah.
no, gibson is covered in potholes.
i need her name if I am going to return her glove.
you know what?
tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau.
just tell them, please.
who.
that is ridiculous, of course it was not me.
i think this is going to be the best christmas party ever.
well, toby, i went all-in on the first hand, so does not that tell you that i might have good cards, too?
relax, ok. and because this is christmas, i am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing.
they are just numbers and boring and blech.
mm-hmm.
ok. why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea?
oh, your face!
i wanted to pay for your education.
i just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.
the liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.
this is the real world.
no nobbies, no probbies.
i do not know what the best plan is, pam.
apres-vous.
the giant baby.
what?
good.
if it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day?
i am here to tell ya.
andy, what time's the show?
you got to help me here.
now i have got their attention.
give me a hand.
you think you are excited?
just get in the car.
no.
well, maybe they will not get slashed if you answer all my questions.
i think i just have to wait out you.
no.
then burn the list.
the sales call!
sold for 1,000 dollar.
I am telling the truth.
wow.
you mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
they will probably watch it right away.
six?
this is a keystone account.
so get your charities in to pam.
listen, you are a perfectly fine toilet.
especially if you think that life would be better without legs!
I am joking.
"oh hey guys, welcome to my home.
I am prison mike!
we would never get off the runway.
this is b.s.
crazy day.
it is not, uh, it is not just about her, so... mint chocolate chip!
i fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
answer: no, because this is being given priority one.
mmhmm, I am sorry.
we can do it.
i like to get in there and get my hands dirty!
i am a sheriff's deputy.
because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
yeah.
do not tell karen about the industrial copier.
her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence.
this whole pam/ryan debate is screwing with my head.
oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars because they failed to report a mold problem.
drop what you are doing.
all right, you know what?
watch it... please.
and before that, time travelers.
assistant sensei.
everybody i just got off the horn with corporate and basically i told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment.
come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
nudity required.
it is a hollowed out sponge... ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper.
we already have that.
not a word.
can not talk, saving the planet.
and then you put a wire on him and you find out who is selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch.
yeah, get them, creed!
what did you have, stanley?
very well .
yes my hero!
well, might be a ride home.
that-- wow.
the aye's have it.
one side, as sharp as you would ever want something to be.
yeah!
right now, you are like 'oh, what is more important?
yo soy cancun.
i want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.
to see the ones that you love.
i can see the security guard's eyes.
no, i have the only one.
so, i respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.
she tells me to stop.
for you we have one of our top people kevin malone.
can i get you a tankard of mead?
whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
hello january wow, kevin, really?
i want you to fall on your sword for me.
what kind of mileage does this baby get?
i saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.
we will see.
uh huh.
"i guess i missed you." i guess i missed you.
a dsi?
now all it takes is half a liter.
forget about retiring when you are 65. hey, I have got an idea.
well then you are not going to talk to the new building owner.
really?
what is he wearing?
this is darryl, one of our warehouse staff.
they do not give out black belts for things that are stupid.
dwight, you have not seen meredith yet, have you?
oh, how are you?
because i believe in rewarding people for their efforts.
you should have an m&amp;m, they are really good.
that would be humiliating.
number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it.
not you, erin.
you made it, suit up, you are on the team!
i do not know.
yeah, feel free to use that.
a point is not a say.
alright, alright.
aha!
good luck to you.
could you send her in?
you have just never seen it.
hey.
hey, alright, you know what, clearly I am outnumbered here, but can i just say one thing, please?
so phyllis, i am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind.
well, then just have the tomato and ketchup.
no.
so...  psych.
try my...  all right!
no more knock-knock jokes.
mm hm.
if i get the deicing gig, it is not going to be on merit.
mmmmm.
ok. to what do i owe this great honor, david wallace?
absolutely.
pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
absolutely but not really.
yeah, it is a business lunch.
i would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
nah, that is a ge.
could kathy, darryl, phyllis, kevin and kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
they say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because i found out before anybody so I have had more time to be sad.
i was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I am okay with it.
where do you come up with this stuff?
i know.
I am just going to leave right now.
how 'bout i remain seated... and i just do a little bit of a nod.
everyone, okay?
are you kidding me?!
punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
listen to me.
c'mere, c'mere, c'mon!
i knew that finding a successor would be difficult.
oh, my god.
here is a box cutter to get her clothes off.
on your mark.
I am out of here.
it is okay, just we will not judge you.
that is okay.
this office is cursed.
no.
you said the program is not open to caucasians.
and... no, I am first mate.
no!
okay, well, let us... .
they are into appearance.
I am going to give erin $15.
i got on that ramp and i thought two hours, two hours to go.
okay, well... jim?
you do not read it aloud like that!
we can talk about that.
mmm-hmm.
well, i guess this is it.
i like the musical "grease", or as we call it, "home".
that you can make fun of everybody else?
I will have a cup of a coffee.
look at him.
and you know that.
so we are good?
all right.
and at some point, the daddy can not take a bath with the kids anymore.
am i correct?
and it is very painful.
okay, everybody.
that is not going to be our story.
apparently scranton has the best sales of any regional branch.
stop that.
get in the car.
please stop it, stop it.
you have to take x-rays.
anybody have any ideas of what we could do.
you looking for fun?
follow me, come here.
good attitude, hottest in the office.
i took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
yeah, so what if i did?
it is moving day.
thanks so much earl.
take off your jacket and take a seat.
i never sold any paper, because I am an idiot.
toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.
if the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that is where the nurse can live.
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.
do not worry, michael.
smeagol was corrupted and became gollum.
i do not see it.
that is an amusing link.
so, okay, you are a salesman.
okay, you can stop.
no.
that way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar, she can see it.
and the little shark eats a littler shark.
goooood morning, viet-nashua!
oh, hey, listen, jim.
get out.
from the top.
and uh, it is fine for the time being.
take my favorite truck.
so maybe.
you are the idiot!
agreed?
yeah, oh, hope not!
great job, great laughs.
sorry.
or a racecar?
it is a good thing russia does not exist anymore.
there are forty rules all schrute boys must learn before the age of five.
you are welcome.
it would be better if you were unconscious.
oh, hey, do you still work here?
the computer should be scared of me!
thank you.
okay, no, that was a fun raiser.
it goes out automatically at five p.m. well, i would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
he was already dead.
i know that you went to corporate this morning, and i know that you lied about it.
how are you?
did you sneeze it off?
that is part of life.
hi, jan, it is michael.
david told me.
oh that is real creative.
I am going to run this by toby and accounting and have him assemble the data.
you never know about the press.
i just got off the phone with the mill.
formally known as toilet guard?
this is the novelization of the movie precious based on the book push by sapphire.
have it your way.
or do i finally get around to seeing sophie's choice?
it is too late to undo it.
gah!
under the smallest one is a case.
you said- you said that you were- that is it?
two, I will need an office.
hello, i would like to apply for a job.
i... love it!!
they are not.
and our, all of ours joys.
no, you are supposed to say, "rock the house." that is my corner.
oh do you?
she cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack.
I am going to engrave that into a piece of wood.
oscar night.
whoa there you are, i did not see you there behind that grain of rice.
i am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
smile!
and it could not come a moment too soon because i have been without food for a good three hours or so.
it is kind of snooty.
because i do not like to be cooped up in that office!
it is fun.
because I am mighty?
jim halpert... dwight schrute... intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch.
sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that is always trying to teach people things.
excuse me  ah, un guard.
gentlemen, start your engines.
god!
congratulations.
just make that copy okay?
i need to change my emergency contact information from michael scott.
all the channels are going to be different there.
now then, we were saying.
i think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
really?
be... because you look exactly alike.
mee!
i do not believe you.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
really?
we are going to go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we are going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, i would like you to forget everything that toby has said, okay?
your pranks have never worked in the past and they are not going to work today.
i can make sure things are up to code.
nothing is going to stop me.
no, i would never leave you for dead.
that is it!
yeah.
mm-hmm.
well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest- -that none of us can be a part of- -then, we, are going to have our own private valentine's day party.
you are out of order, sir.
mm, nope.
I would prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
do you need anything?
and the sheets are made of fire.
you know what, dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
give me a good firm... ooh!
did i happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
what is a leader?
oh... oh!
yeah!
you are not leaving.
i made a family!
there is an employee named jim halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay?
conference room, five minutes.
which we can not know.
um, couple of months ago, dwight tried to go behind my back with jan and get my job and i am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
ok, sweetie.
my boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and i have always been intrigued by all things international.
yaaaaay.
amazing breasts.
come on.
my pants fell down!
i want someone to follow donna.
that would be exciting.
salesman is king.
and you guys are the mother and daughter.
depression-- nn-- depression.
natch.
extremely excited?
come on, erin.
previous record?
i regret offending my coworkers.
give me a break, man.
idiots!
okay, let us go to hayworth's.
what are they?
it is not in the contract.
okay, one.
pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
is it safe that park that in my driveway.
okay, field trip's over.
no!
yeah, i got to get in on this.
oohh.
i can not... vouch for that.
do you need a ride?
uh, yes, I am in charge.
yes.
ok, well played.
you were surprised, were not you?
so... yes, you did.
so what, you are having a little spat.
what?
okay, fine.
aah!
tell him I am retired.
but, if you do your spring cleaning in january; guess what you do not have to do in the spring?
um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
okay.
i know, i know.
i will require beer and pizza to think this over.
because i loves to party and I am going to be partying my butt out at this place.
ryan!
at that time, i will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as... whoa.
it is gone, I am in the zone.
i just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that i should know first.
it is the most annoying thing.
very serious.
was it the cleavage?
how can i put this?
ohh, ohh.
hey.
no.
that is really fattening.
that is too much peanut butter.
check it again.
it is stupid.
how do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "i told you so."  gently with a rose?
i am goateeless.
we will see.
ahh-chaa!
anybody seen something like-lying around?
from a late delivery to an accounting error.
it is too late.
shhh!
so... ...but i think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that clark's getting out of my car.
she is an alternate.
yeah, i told them on the phone that i was ordering eight pizzas.
letter to the editor.
they are extraordinary.
do not... what... i do not understand.
dwight, what is your middle name.
show of hands.
yeah?
check... on that later today.
just trying to be helpful.
why am i so sad?
you know what?
nike.
why is everyone else standing up?
no.
depression is a very serious illness.
i will do my job to the best of my abilities.
got it.
then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.
missed you as part of our family.
i did not say it, i declared it.
that is great.
this is so stupid.
you got it.
what if i told you i could offer free shipping?
not on oscar's head.
i prefer the human way.
should i trust jim?
just do a cartwheel!
uh, yeah.
I am burned!
okay.
ah, ringbearer.
i vouched for you in front of todd packer, dwight.
see i learned improve from the greats, like, um, drew carey and ryan stiles.
i can not finish.
alright.
you gave all the love that i needed... pum pum pum pum pum pum pum bye pam.
he is a goner.
let... let me out.
so you have it right?
who is this?
i have something here.
i sure do.
hey.
oh my god.
i am ashamed at your naked face.
let me show you what I have been working on.
yah!
but if you stay, i want an apology,  and i want a big one.
like a grownup.
okay, all right.
alright.
maybe he is going to church.
the hyatt in wilkes-barre?
good.
okay, go back to the annex.
whoooo!
did you see a big package?
yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
atherozar!
he sucked.
jim and pam!
what kind do you want?
mmm-kay.
angela, what is the score?
just -- stop.
you are wrong.
because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "i want to go to mount pocono," you go to mount pocono and you do her.
makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing.
what is her name?
if you are listening to this you are a lucky woman michael has seduced.
dwight, dwight, great idea.
hello dana, i am michael and this is jim and we are brothers.
michael's up on the roof and he is acting strange!
same old.
i do.
oh, you are such mench my friend.
yeah, but no, seriously.
motel 6?
I am ryan, and tonight did not go the way that i thought it would, because it did not work out for me, and I am very embarrassed.
like a butler.
okay, fine.
perfect immune system.
now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap.
supreme.
this is good.
come on.
ugh.
we are going to have a baby.
runaway train, never come back.
you want to talk now, good; ok, dwight, leave.
that is ridiculous.
we all kind of hate it though.
do not you work here full-time?
no, no, no.
do not mess with me.
really?
"dear mr. scott.
and they have some good points... do not get hysterical.
oh, god.
i can not run.
well, what am i thinking?
let us try a little... little social experiment here.
no.
thank you.
it is just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you have no place to go but down.
i am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.
ok, 1 sikh, and... you spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.
he can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master.
yes.
it is called the wastepaper basket!
yeah.
rule five - safety first,  i.e.
respect the birthday please.
alright.
come on!
i had a pretty good day today.
and it will not kill erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like i promised him...  i bet his heart is enlarged, though.
no, time out, time out.
every day is black tie optional!
yeah, i did.
come on, buddy.
it is an honor and a privilege.
crap.
this is not as much fun as i thought it would be.
i will do better.
I am just... i, i can not even imagine... the... thing.
question.
today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
all right.
...never been lower!
i will speak from the heart.
roasted.
so, I am not exactly sure how to say this... what are you doing?
i really do not want to take the chill pill.
yes, i know that.
oh i think i faked oscar out.
huh?
no.
oh, really?
there is one more suggestion.
I will show you my id.' she has not come back yet.
so back to work.
do not ape me.
and the third time... i did it out of spite.
a giant net?
you will.
hey, watch it, watch it.
or, duality of man.
oh!
lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
well i have interviews.
well, what?
okay.
because a lot of people think that models, even though they are very attractive, are somewhat vapid.
idiot.
james halpert.
thank you sir!
i did.
are we too cool?
you better check your things, people.
maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
got to keep the troops entertained.
time to bring out the big guns.
dwight!
well, pam is cute.
this is dwight schrute.
what?
if he even wants it.
last time i was down there, i noticed they would put up a couple of hoops, and i play basketball every weekend.
two.
he was a volunteer sheriff too.
not that a lot of people here in america know what a sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a sensei.
come on!
drinks are on me!
that you are afraid.
it is howard gruber.
come on!
it was weird though.
wait, stop writing that.
you need an attack plan.
and my new favorite restaurant sucks... i bought a video camera last year, and i was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that i felt was worth taping the whole year.
I am not going get a brain- stop it.
you guys just are workin' for the weekend, are not you?
somebody, who i think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out.
you would better try it on, make sure it fits.
meow.
she is young, she is beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them.
it was done out of love, just like i thought.
okay, let us go.
sure you do not want to come?
we should have a party and not invite them.
just a formality.
oh, I am really worried that I am going to say it.
the mall, the stores, the kiosks!
scranton.
waagh!
and he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita.
your tiny fingers make the best knots.
I am just talking about a... you can not possibly be serious.
you do not, you do not know me.
you know what i was thinking might be sort of fun?
i know.
how about now?
suck it up.
get in the sidecar.
game, what game are we playing here?
gyeeeaahhh!
good.
ohh, yeah, let us get started because uh, yes, because uh this is very serious business and umm.. ...business meeting -- that is right!
they are not breathing.
hey.
yesss!
you went over my head.
let me handle this, jim.
it is a lie.
thank you.
I will kill you man!
so i am going to hear her out.
i have an amazing mnemonic device, by which i have memorized all of your names.
and i got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star.
the hostess says, "table for one?" how is this possible?
that is so spicy.
who?
josh porter, high five.
i have a smudge on my forehead?
chang's.
i achieved that, no thanks to my appendix.
it is not a prank.
this next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.
i do not want to hear about it.
hey, stanley, in case i do not see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash.
a crescent allan?
give it a little test drive, what do you say?
you know?
yup.
that would not even make sense.
whoa!
you never yell at the client.
my halloween is ruined.
part of your duties are to what?
I am sick of the little disapproving head shakes.
I will have one of those as well.
because I am a genie in a bottle, and I am going to grant you three wishes.
should have peed before i left.
hi.
i am really disappointed in the office's policy on pda at this moment.
i think that was ... i was probed.
and her name is italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
alright, by pickle.
no.
hey.
why do not you just take off early?
i want to do it.
huh?
you know what i might do, i might make this into a kids' room.
listen, uh may i speak with you... privately?
but it is fun.

i just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible.
i checked the route - there are no potholes.

no.
i believe that boy may be a schrute.
it is lower.
come in.
meredith, you know what?
this is the reason we are here.
off the backboard!
that is because I am your right-hand man, michael, but i can not do it again.
come on.
ahh.
check out time is never.
that could have gone one of two ways, but i never expected her to get upset.
but i had to start somewhere.

okay, yes, sure, i will do that... ...because I am the first to to find out.
hey howard.
yes, hello.
we are not hiring, jim.

well, why not?
worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
that is what makes it fun.
ohhh, what?
i have a cold sore.
why did not i think of this before?
it is michael.
hi.
mm, less than three.
what is up?
do not get too excited, that is out of 20.  right this way.
we regained the white pages, the school district, lackawanna county.
it is not even that interesting a baby otter, it can not even stand up.
just close your eyes.
you are falling for it.
but we are falling behind, did you know that?
you all do it.
nice side note: they might think "hey, i should have been nicer to michael."  but that is... not why I am doing this... then, i land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.
and i have not been there in months.
well you know what jim?
okay, okay.
we were not expecting you!
because she must want to shoot herself in the face.
pretend that your jobs depend on it.
he is molesting people via the internet.
exactly, were not... with tolerance.
seems smart enough.
i know, it is a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!

to retrieve... i left my cell phone here.
bah!
wow, what a day!

hmm.
i want you to say I am an alcoholic.
it can wait.
nine dollars.
ok. if you make me head of sales one more time, i swear.
kidding.
or, like stormin' norman schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it is over, we will not have to deal with those iraqis anymore.
coolio.
no really, it is, it is very nice.
this is, this is totally on me.
or a woman.
that does not mean anything, those are just words.
listen up everyone!
rolando,  I would like you to meet pam.
yes!
okay.
this is not funny.
yes, i just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to jamaica with me.
stop it.
some people never figured it out.
right?
oh no, it is broken.
I will be back, i mean... why?

I am going to take a little breather for a second.
what do you say?
hey, josh, how ya doing?
hello little boy, what is your name?
thank you everybody!
yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks.
i mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff.
busted.
and then i thought maybe by the time i was 40, but by 40, i had less money than when i was 30.  maybe by my 50s, i do not know.
at all?
the propaganda wing of bill and melinda gates and viewers like you.
you would not believe what happened here.
yes.

was i smiling?
that is a good point.
I am recyclops.
listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for ryan and pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
you told me that several times.
what matters is that christmas is fun, right?
you would think they would discourage people from bringing in balloons.
hey, i could get some flares from my car.
erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
yes.
no?
may i have everyone is attention, please?
you must turn over to me all christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on january fourth.
um, no actually i got them at a fancier place.
look.
hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest." he is totally wrong, pam.

andy, I have been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should i join?
you need the big guns, yes?
it is just harmless steam to panic intruders.
yes, you did.
okay.
i just have some questions that i was going to ask.
if michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
the two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.
thanks.

you are an annex kid.
bom bom bom-bom bom.
huh, ok. now you and i have a conflict.
we are totally alone.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
look into that.
you would think they would be sick of each other by now.
and besides, i only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and jan, and pam and jim, and angela and andy.
excuse me, mr. wallace?
we are just office drones.
i do not have a lot of experience with vampires, but i have hunted werewolves.
good.
ok. who reports to who?
</p> yes i do.
do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen?
okay, well, i really think that... yeah.

i guess I am not the kind of guy that is good enough for precious heirlooms.
"do not sleep with your boss"?
uh... uh, okay.
okay.
you might want to use him to sort of get that orville redenbacher dynamic going.
right?
what is important is that you say yes.
i can not risk them coming back to schrute farms.
hi daryl.
we just need to find them.
yeah sales, you sell pizza.

so i have to take the normal door.
are you sure?
oh, is somebody making fun of me?
89... 88... you are twenty minutes late!

exactly.
i was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
perfect.

so they asked me to give a statement to the press.
I am here to take what is mine.
we do not need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... what is your name?

it appears that the website has become alive.
stanley.
I am keeping it.
my grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum.
abort.
I am sorry.
i am going to be better.
conference room, right now!
if there were any in here, they would have imbedded themselves in me.

no it is not.
ok. come on january after all we have been through... we have a history... ...between us.

they put a hate note under my windshield wiper.
shotgun goes to ryan.
i am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
it is a scary... it is a... it is a predicament, and it is something that each and every one of us has to think about.
because i have him investigating her.
why thank you very much.
these meetings are useless.
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right!
and i think it is better to die with people you like... like oscar, and andy, and concierge marie... than to know that there is somebody out there that you love that you are not with.
can i talk to you for a sec?
got it, dave.
hi, I am michael scott, dunder-mifflin.
no, much better-no one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
it symbolizes the battle between good and evil... i see dead people.
right?
"for a good time, call michael scott"?
then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
case in point, jfk.
i should know.

I am putting my bed right over here.
all right... is that it?
well, you know, money is not everything jim.
how did that get there?
but upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so i threw it away.
uh, here we go.
the important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win.
instead, it has become like when my mom moved in with jeff.
he is like a manatee.
it is just that i own the coffee shop.
my own.
he is such a sore loser.
if you disagree, say anything...  very well.
is it?
alright.
in fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability.
and actually, you know what we should do?
ooh.
that was darryl philbin's.
no.
you are right, you are right.
we are guys, so... no, why?
does not matter, it is an order.
ok, everybody listen up.

stop!
paper is the manure!
uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.
but, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side.
or ryan stiles, something like that.
that is a little kinky.
no, no, no, wait!
the dundie award for "longest engagement" goes to pam beesley.
i need three, maybe two.
hey, well, we have time!
it is so hateful.
you still mad?
it takes guts to be a regional manager.
thank you.
i sort of set the tone.
okay!
okay, you know what?
well i do not know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
no, no, no, i was here first.
here is my toast.
you talkin' to me?
you have to close.
oh, your little feelings party did not work out?
i will say b, buffalo!

let us get back together.
ah, okay.
hello?
i will find her and i will bring her to you and as god as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
that just- you have really grown.
she was stoned apparently.
parley, my office, five minutes.
oh.
everyone out!
bye.
obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I am launching a full investigation.
erin?
it is pretty funny when you think about it.
mmm-hmm.
hmmm... she is been talking to michael a lot.
okay.
just try and rattle rolf.
mm-do... dwight would not- i. understand.
here we go.
you are right.
unleash it.
work it out amongst your selves!
these are not criminals.
three.
oh, man.
well, they whipped people which was helpful.
i have to say, i like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
do not cap that pen!
okay, i will start.
as much as i might want to.
if the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
all right.
okay, that is uh, hard to keep track.
whereas back here in scranton i am still top dog, in a fairly large pond.
get whatever you want.
whose got one, whose got a big idea?
what?
if the boat's a-rockin', do not come knockin'!
if i find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity?
okay, hey, hey, hey... did not think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, jim?
hey, this guy look familiar?
yeah right.
welcome.
this is a work bus.
when i was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... i got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and i had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and i never came outside.
very close.
slow and steady.
i would not make that mistake again.
i love you.
sly dog.
uhhgh.
and walk the 'lord of the rings' trail to mordor.
holly.
i... if i was going to put someone in charge, i would put burt in charge or i would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like maria or gordon, maybe.
you shaved?
tails.
eat it.
for the insurance money!
quiet, you.
are you still having intercourse with her?
well, fine.
i want a sebring.
all right.
who is next, who is next, who is next, who is?
no, I am carrying around the stick in order to look cool.
i do not think i would have been able to endure my breakup with holly had it not been for toss across.
pa rum pump um pum  i have no gifts for you.
and pam and jim are my best friends and our kids play together.
'wow!
in an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager.
there you go.
so do, um, do sad, do the sad face.
that you are stubborn.
no, not right now.
i have not talked to her since.
where you going, big guy?
these sleeves are cutting off my circulation.
what?
yes, and i am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days.
i do not know.
rrrah!
boom!
there is got to be another way.
it is not a limo.
I am going to start the bidding, because this is something that i have dreamt of- okay.
we need someone who is actually made a sale.
what i propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and i need your help.
still do not know who i am?
that is exactly how it should work.
i, jim halpert... ...confess to health care fraud.
and kevin and stanley, if you do not stop worrying so much about what you are going to put in your gullet, you are going to die in about a month.
why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?
although, i can not say i was a big fan of  'bowling for columbine', because i thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'kingpin'.
yeah, I am good.
hello, I am michael scott, welcome to our little shindig.
well, he can not do what i can do.
is he why you left?
love.

we heard what you said.
too long!
bravo, my young ward.
actually, it is polite to arrive early.
but life goes on.
i say no.
no!
look since you have the machine up and running, can i just stick my foot, we take a look?
i can not go back.
plus, I have got a secret weapon.
you know who is a real hero?
and we call it, a summer sales-a-lot.
oh god.
wait wait wait wait, bedbugs?
take over.
but he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face.
okay... oh wait!
this is my protege, jim halpert.
who likes to water ski on lake erie?
yeah!
I would like to go around the room and have us each express to meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.
you did not actually think i was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?

i had to make a snap decision dwight.
let me give you a hand.
augh!
so sue me... no, do not sue me.
couple weeks ago i went to get a new cellphone and i wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'who are your 5 friends?' and I am, like, 'uh... ' i did not even know i could not even think.
it will not.
you can not expect them to be careful every time.
today i got up, i stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that is it.
yah!
I am throwing up.
okay.
she said she was going to give it to him right now.
thank you.
well, hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order.

every fall, my uncle eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in.
paintball.
phyllis, stanley.
well, well, well.
its over, michael, its over.
well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than i thought they would be.
first up, the lost and found has gone missing.
that is funny.
i love stuff.
yeah!
ok. a man and his son get into a car accident.

um... and then like twelve other kids came forward.
let us go.
come on!
we are making a commercial for dunder mifflin today.
I am an adult, i do not have to think or do anything.
have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub?
yeah?
how about a little bosa nova?
but the truth is, i can not do this.
no, you can not have it.
why are you sleeping that way?
holly and i can never be just friends.
oh, ok. masters of comedy.
see?
oh come on.
he is a friend.
well, it is not really a big speech.
hello, little man.
he is always been a liar.
all right.
um... that was not much of an introduction.
oh, well, I am glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I am down here it does not seem too busy to me.
nah, i do not know... still think nakiri's better.
oh, my.
i won salesman of the year.
this is no good.
that is great.
he is got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible.
but your life is very good, my friend.
all right, i have some news for you.
well, people hear a lot of things, man.
like, "oh good.
here is a list of things that michael would like to be surprised by.
demarcation.
alright everybody, you know i kid, you know i kid.
there has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
yes!
wow.
I have never done this before.
i do not think that i can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.
aw, it is alright.
good.
i do not even know, first-name basis!
it is a yoga lesson from holly flax!
this kid had the magazine i wanted to read, that is the only one i could reach and i read it and then i read it again.

i must have imagined it.
it is very cool.
it was hard enough to convince jan to come.
smileaEUR nod.
no michael here, my name is- no, you shut up.
mose, hey, it is dwight.
for which i take full responsibility.
we will do this the hard way.
i think it is a success and I am the one who ended up with dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
thanks dwight.
okay goodbye, goodbye.
I am sorry.
people, holly's coming back, and this is the most important christmas party of my life.
he is a potential drug mule.
I have been wanting schrute farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity.
and angela and phyllis, you are my grandmas.
that is our only option.
in the ocean.
ohh... ok. i know why she is calling.
he is pretend and he does exactly as i tell him to.
stop having fun.
jennifer garner portrayed one on alias.
alf, you know, i might have actually been probed by alf.
he just was mirroring.
no, i think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
they are a small company.
see-through, push-up, lace?
and you burned over a thousand calories walking home.
so does this remind you of your childhood right now?
oh, here we go, here we go.
here we go.
you cannot learn from books.
do not look at me.
i specifically remember there were a lot of other people i thought should be considered.
and finally, pam beesly.
get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me.
just have it ready.
i think kevin wants one.
it is called a costume.
mmmhmm.
nope.
you sold us all on andy, a product that nobody wanted.
he stretched his pelvic bowl!
last week i finally became permanent manager of dunder mifflin scranton.
he is not a songbird.
well, who is that one?
ok, i am going to tell michael and this entire office will be punished!
kids.
let us get right down to business.
just life- and doing things- before you die.
fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
we are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives.
god, stanley, that is frickin' brilliant.
if you need to vomit, that is ok. i did.
check her out.
see, this is of general interest.
uh, she works in the annex.
alright.
it is ok here, but people sometimes take advantage because it is so relaxed.
are you kidding me?
the best way to learn is by watching.
when i hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous.
no, no you are wrong about this.
why can not boys play with dolls?
nice try.
i mean, it makes the battle of gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush.
kinky!
do you know that?
define foment.
and another thing about the indian people... they love sex positions.
oh, god.
for instance, the time i brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
meryl streep is the bad guy.
it was clerical.
and andy, where is he?
dunder-mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
we are here.
I am hearing you, meeting confirmed.
i am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
so i looked him in the eye and i said, "not today grotti, not today.
smokin' doobies.
hey!
jan!?
just leave it.
and i believe in your ability to make the right choices.
martini bars are pretentious.
hmm, probably, but now i know something he does not want me to know.
oh!
jim tricked me into thinking I would won a walk-on part on ncis, but that is not important.
you know what, I am thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like.
so I am... okay, well, we will figure something.
talk to me face.
try scared to death.
i want you to switch desks, I am going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything!
no, no, i can do this.
this is fun.
keep on point.
i would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because i am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor.
there are a lot of different ways to get revenge.
uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
i love pad thai.
she is probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar!
oh, agreed, mmm, except... hey hey... what is up chuck?
they are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.
come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys.
the guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.
good work.
i do not think so, no.
ok ok ok no no no.
here goes.
come on- here we go.
that is why you made the decision.
it is an orientation.
explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
how about angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which oscar wears.
seven deadly sins.
welcome.
this is where paper comes from.
nothing he is doing is cheering me up.
can you do that for me?
I am  against violence in the workplace.
i love women.
huh?
oh, no.
why do not you run them again?
no, this is not a joke.
you got no time to spend with your wife and kids.
so stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
they deserve the right to dress as they please.
messages.
maybe!
only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
yes, it does.
bye.
turns out, he had only eaten one of mose's cream pies.
i apologized for that.
come on.
it just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are going to singe your eyebrows.
michael is awesome!
i was born a man, halpert.
these are shaped like paper.
michael said, "we must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them." i expect to do very well tonight.
oh, well, that is fine.
fireball.
that is a good question.
um, i got some photos from costa rica if you want to see them?
all right.
it was dark, warm, wet.
no, no, it is great.
hey!
michael we are coming for you!
that way i will not have to get her a gift.

well, that is not what I am saying.
yes.
I am just walking around.
i know, i know.

everyone seems to get along!
and without any plot, there is no movie.
really.
how about this one?
i say salesmen... and women of the world unite!
thanks.
is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
very funny jim.
and you know what he said to me?
was it nice?
I am going to be in mexico for my half-birthday.
okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for.
if you do not like it, stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
I am not.
that sounds hilarious.
all right.
worst seventy-five bucks i ever spent.
can sometimes i drive your car and you drive mine?
if your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
pam, pam!

you can not see.
okay, this is important.
come on in.
curse of three.
let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
people can not keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
yes, i am, charles.
stop it.
oh!

that is been- right, standard.
today, smoking is going to save lives.
mmhmm, bravo!
other than by using magic.
i would just find an excuse to come here so i could stare at you through that window.
cindy!

but that is my sale.
gotcha.
mm.
yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
we shoulda brought andy.
i told you the titles are irrelevant.
people, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days.
what would you say, if i told you that i was about to change your life?
well just as long as it means jim becomes a manager.
i think it is kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
and... you... everybody can laugh.
i am declining to speak first.
still good.
i got next, i got next up.
you crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.

I will order you some cranberry juice.
except dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
toby, katy.

it will take a swat team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that." that is how devoted i am to this job.
please?
cool.
sharing... and tolerance.
oh, come on.
yes!
this has been a wonderful day.
as a farmer, i know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery.
and if i had a gun with two bullets and i was in a room with hitler, bin laden, and toby, i would shoot toby twice.
wooo-yaaaaah!
yeah?
you know what they say, keep your friends close.
uh, yes you are.
n- well, to be fair, jim... james... jimothy... to be fair, jimothy, the- ah, that sounds weird.

right here.
look at this.
it is empty!
schrute farms, guten tag.
the city's laid out from east to west and our public parks are libraries are truly the best.

i work with a bunch of nerds.
uh, pam, one more thing.
uh-oh.
it is sort of our perk!

do not you want a sheath for that?
january mr. of'malley.

that was not necessary, but i appreciated it.
ready?
that - it is, it is more of a disco.
breathe through your nose.
I am very fast!
open the door!
no.
so... oh, that was the last good item.
now, I have always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here .
I am not familiar with that expression, it does not make sense, of course I am alive.
i know that is what he said.
i did not hear you.
stanley, one way or another, you are going to come with me to make this sale.
that is, yep a little flimsy.
it is hard for me to imagine a scenario, where meredith palmer keeps her job and david wallace does not - no offense meredith.
scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers.
we kissed.
yuck, yuck.
in the wild, health care is, "ow, i hurt my leg.

good evening.
if-a you change-a you mind, why do not you talk to mikanos?
i need you to go back to bed.
should we help  them pick up their stuff?
maybe.
I am so in love with her.
the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
i miss her so much.
if you do not have a pet, please do not feel like - ah, yes, the leads.
let me steep that for you.
wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?

oh god, that is a terrible idea.
right?
it is just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
fresh hot ink.
i was thinking of entering it into some festivals.
what?
so i was wondering if you could explain.
have you heard... if the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, i am a volunteer sheriff's deputy, and you can count on me.
you were laughing.
well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the gilligan thing, so... right now, i was thinking.
we have three scenes to film, big scenes.
are you sure you are doing that right?
uh, what the hell is happening?
i mean i just do not want to have to tell them something they are not going to want to hear.
i do not want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed there is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
ok!
just tell me what the bathroom wall says.
we did it!
mmm-- mmm...  um... close the door.
you know what might be kind of fun?
so, what about you, angela?
good job.
come on out!
we are not.
hey, what say we order up some pasta?
mine was retribution.
are you done?
and you know what I would like?
and i have said goodbye to half of them.
I will something like that.
in fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met harriet and now she thinks she is better than everybody.
you are not prone to seizures?
let us go!
no, no, no.
sorry, now you will never be able to get that out of your head.
okay.
ohhh happy birthday jim!
angela?
well your son sounds like he is really motivated.
what i failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad.
how is it fair to them?!
so you have 40 boxes going out, and i will deliver those personally in a sebring.
pro.
listen a little question for you, buddy.
please, not at a time like this.
you know there is a phrase about that in german.
yes.
i think i should be on the team.
todd f. packer.
oh, so that is what they are saying?
early.
ok!
but she injured herself having fun and i do not think she would trade that memory for anything.
have you ever made a sandwich before?
how do i look?
here is the deal - one signature for every song.
you make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
whatever.
conference room, 10 minutes.
absolutely.
oh, I am sorry.
because a real relationship, it... it can not be forced.
tell me later.
it seemed kind of random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
you are welcome, sir.
king has sex with a unicorn?
let us go.
what is wrong with you?
a long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
it is a weird day for false facts.
oh, you are kidding me!
everybody else is past it.
wish i could fire sherri.
what is a bad idea?
what happened?
uhh... hehe hah!
why?
all right, all right, secret sign.
it is dehydration.
do you ever watch battlestar galactica?
i sa- sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet!
i am awesome!
"hey, you think you can do my job better?" i do not know.
but, yes.
no.
i love ya pam... okay.
uh, pam?
or else what?
"okay?"  we used to go for "pretty good." yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.
geniuses.
what do you know about management, dwight?
we are canceling it.
that is how we buy them actually.
that must have been fun.
i am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a senator.
surprise!
um.
dwight, get the door.
yes?
sweet.
somebody got donuts for my birthday!
when you catch the ball, i want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then i want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.
let us, uh,... let us rock.
ok, i think we are losing sight of what is really important here.
well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
jim, for instance, has a huge tell.
that is why you suck!" no.
hi.
yes, kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a bynes or a hope.
no, there are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases.
might as well of been toilet paper.
but you can be in charge of the women.
that is because this baby is of superior intelligence.
all right, well, go find some.
that probably had something to do with the camera work.
how are ya?
i know just he place.
then... youtube gets a hold of it... you are right.
lay it on them.
how do you un-tell something?
I have never seen this place in the daylight.
no.
oh!
hey!
and that is why so many other people in my class were kids.
hello.
you know what?
i roped it off.
no, you did not see me in there with her.
and harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt voldemort's surge of vicious anger.
oh, i could beat up dwight.
i had a great time at prom.
we will go to the dump, we will look around, then we will all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night.
might be good.
in this dream i did both of these jobs beautifully, and i loved it, and everybody loved me.
that was wonderful.
hmmph!
and i suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.
you could do whatever you want to do.
well, let us see, i made pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck.
lackawanna county says that it is okay for me to perform cpr, but for michael my lips are not qualified enough for his perfect little face.
i do not know, i offered him his temp job back.
leave the keys.
this is not 'lord of the rings'.
no, no, do not, do not tell me.
in that case, war was the right choice.
negotiations are all about controlling things.
well they notice it.
is this how you treat your vip's, ryan?
yes.
sheriff, this is volunteer sheriff's deputy dwight schrute.
the streamers?
aah!
that is right, a couple of old friends.
she practically told me so.
please.
ohh.
your spine is jacked.
we have about an hour and half.
move, move, move, move!
what do you race cars?
i was in a production of "oklahoma" in the seventh grade.
what i miss?
what- I am relaxing.
like the regional manager of the day.
people are tolerant!
are you being the best that you can be?
i know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I am not here.
we got it.
that is like a five second delay.
i am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts.
do you know what I am referring to?
i know, somebody will.
okay.
because I am not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba- i have a very difficult decision to make.
cool.
there is stink in there, my god!
man, it is like hoisting a manatee.
yes, i do.
thank goodness none of that was true.
that is my stopwatch.
no, I am not having monkey problems.
you are not allowed to play two-player.

kelly kapour.
yes.
baked potato on the side.
what did i do?
that was, that was slick.
not.
you pretend to be angela's father, you will play angela, and uh, i will pretend to be you.

so delicious.
damn it, jim!
we just-we wanted to know your tricks.
standing.
no, not until i have some good news for them.
too embarrassing for you?
hey.
spoken like a true root man.
a little road trip cd.
i told her i did not know whether you would want to do it... because you have always been so loyal to me.
hello, good morning.
but it is cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can not scrub worth a damn.
bastard!
we are going on a harbor cruise of lake wallenpaupack.
what?
no, no, no.
and then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.

pam.

scranton hot dog from scranton?
we have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.

he always wears the ears, and i always give him grief about looking like spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be spock, for some reason.
you are the master.
love, michael." meredith, meredith... meri... mary had a little lamb.
really?
um... you know, the ball's in their court.
i am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up.
it just says "creed." let us hear an opening bid, everybody.
is this wine?
yes.
he has the power of flight.
i think we are spoiled because we do not appreciate the things that we have.
you got burned, because packer's back!
nope, get away.
yeah.
pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
it is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit meredith with my car.
i let everybody down.
hey, phyllis, do i need this invite to get in to the party?
stanley.
stay below the smoke line.
which one is it?
i pity her.
yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, did not you?
glee?
well stanley, maybe you are feeling that you do not respect me because you do not know me very well.
what?
jim will be made a warlord's gesture.
really?!
andy, i have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving.
i mean you can tell.
we got fat jim halpert here.
no.
so here is oscar.

forget it!
whatever i write here has to be really, really funny.
hiya!
every night, a different woman.
hey toby!
gah.
and then michael scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
what is wrong with me today?!
babies are one of my many areas of expertise.
when i first met pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way.
and I am very, very proud of that.
are we hiring?
uh huh.
and always keep the power in the conversation.
i just do not know what we would do.
why do not you just let me handle the tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
it slipped.
he knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
so i said, "pop a claritin, and i will spot you the seventy bucks," and she is like "i do not like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication."  and I am like, "well you are really not going to like what i slipped in your drink last night." and she is like, "what the hell are you talking about?" and I am like, "I am kidding.
well i can, but i will have to come back later tonight and pay you.
those people will be ruined.
jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances.
that is what happened to of.j.
my wittle angels.
well - i was here first.
so this year, i have decided to have a co-host.
okay?
but it turns out that jim is also his own worst enemy.
that is just not the way a dunder mifflin manager should go, I am sorry.
no, I am team captain.
haulin' cube!
he is got two dates tonight.
no, you know what?
I am going to wait.
yes, hello?
i heard you say "well" the first time.
kelly.
he seems like a mobster.

no.
iris, thank you so much for having me.
yes, i do!
can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
i am bond fire, james bond fire.
can i authorize a 15% discount?
just hitting "door closed." what?
got to go, i have to take this.
i had put it on my calendar and pam threw that out.
you did this as a prank.
that is a good deal.
prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose.
this?
you would be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out... yeah.
that is my girlfriend.
i need to roll an eight.
okay.
a number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
i am a practitioner of goju ru karate, here in scranton.
lot of gods with unpronounceable names.
no.
okay, you know what?
pam can attest, there is no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
you heard anything yet?
everything's great.
do not take it out.
okay, i will.
we are going to miss you, gabe.
I am probably closest.
so, i did what anyone would do.
I will just let it go to voicemail.
thank you, spoiler alert.
what do you say?
you have the floor, ryan.
you have till five.
you know it is not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night.
i will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone.
friends fight.
oftentimes, in hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders.
including the car phone!
come on!
i do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out.
hey.
um... you cheated on me... when i specifically asked you not to?
and as a fail-safe also every negative email you have ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
still my office, ryan.
who here is been the butt of a joke that has gone too far?
webster's dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch.
but then i got an e-mail from ryan, that he was coming back to town.
we are good.
hey, do not hang up.
five more minutes of mega-desk?
um... why do not you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
thank you.
ah, okay.
hmm.
it is been a long time since we have come down here separately.
have you ever seen this woman?
wow!
no!
hey guys, ah i feel refreshed now.
how did you make that happen?
what is the ratio of stanley nickels to schrute bucks?
come on!
you more of a fruit man or a root man?
alright, so let us get this party staaaarrrrted.
i highly recommend you wear that.
so you draw a line from there to the other planets, and i think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.
extreme!
things were at an all time sad here.
going to be fun!
hey, this office needs a strong man.
let us treat you.
i was excited about meeting somebody new.
used to be a window here.
yes, so, no thank you.
it is for a good because.
and like donna.
excellent.
alright.
you can not stay here, this place is a biohazard.
shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel.
here he comes.
okay, go ahead, they are right.
it is okay, she is cool, she also whistle-blew.
paper company.
no woman would ever want a man who does not know what an auger is.
okay.
that is such good news.
okay, so dwight, in your own words -  "someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons.
okay, secretary says wallace is away for the day and will not be coming back into the office.
over the last few weeks, things have been changing here.
i am going to be cupid, and i am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say "I am in love i was hit by cupid's sparrow."  funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
hey, michael.
yep.
at dunder-mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and i do not know who instituted it.
no preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
yeah.
come here!
no, no, no, no.
you are welcome.
this is long overdue.
it is my idea.
how many indian ceo's can you think of?
idiot.
i will see her every now and then, and... maybe one year she will be with somebody, and the next year, I will be with somebody, and it is going to take a long time... and then it is perfect.
I have dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
conference room!
michael is on vacation and he is asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
ooh.
but... you also have to win to play.
yes, under my tutelage.
michael, i have so much to learn from you.
when a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.
oh, thank you.
let us do it.
well i will prove you wrong.
I am sorry?
phyllis!
we are down here.
they are hazel.
every single last one of them.
well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
hey, cathy.
um.
do not look at him.
wrong.
shh!
i want you to bring a partner.
hey, hey, hey stop it.
maybe we are the kind of guys who end up with a tractor that is already been rode hard and put away muddy.
i thought i would be a father and instead i am a eunuch.
that.
and the 20 little conversations that i have with stanley.
aw, man, is that a prism duro-sport?
okay, the opposite of that?
"hello.
come on!
i do not deserve this, guys.
open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
the cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions.
w-w-wait.
be prepared to hold folks  from 9 am to... nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions... ...for people's behavior.
swingers.
the guys at the papermill-- the guys at the papermill-- no no no!
pam.
okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
some people will tell you salesman is a bad word.
congratulations are in order.
get 'er done.
there was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries.
oh, okay, that is all yours.
oh, my god!
you will not die!
jim will turn to the drink.
packster.
do you consider gabe to be the boss?

anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
oh, um, well, we could have ryan take a look.
hey.
and i... will see you tomorrow morning.
this is the worst.
yes.
this is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.
oh god... okay alright.
you see how they responded to me?
come on.
we could totally break the pig rib!
what do you think?
i have to see these shoes.
jim, big fire in your house.
yeah, looks like everyone is tightening their belts in this economy.
the menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes.
just tell me it is not totally insane to try one more time.
pam, can you come in here, please?
listen to me!
ok.. just get off.
could i have your fax number?
me.
you look great.
oh.
hey, the elevator is disobeying us!
but i get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .. .. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so.
...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, nasa blanket, and, in case i get bored, harry potter and sorcerer's stone.
i do ping.
I am confiscating this.

alright, relax.
because if you want to beat china you will.
you cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.
we are... we are not... we are not doing this today.
we are a great team.
oh.
what about an authentic pennsylvania dutch christmas?
no!
the women in my improve class absolutely hate him.
so phyllis is basically saying, "hey michael, i know you did a lot to help the office this year but i only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth." i gave ryan an ipod.
"you have been compromised.
there she is.
jan levinson-gould.
bye.
that was fun.
you suck!
not yet.
take one, pass it down.
we should go apologize to roy or something.
come on.
just dig.
the buyer was very motivated, as was i. it went for eighty percent of what i paid.
i did it!
have you talked to her about your feelings?
i brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
stop trying to figure me out.
i wish every day was diversity day.
let us ride.
yes, your corner.
no.
i can hook you up.
this is just, a lot more of a laxative.
any specific animal?
you mean cancer?
oh, its just stanley's old photo album.
you might want to watch this angela, because you can not catch anything.
soil.
when two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
but, do not worry.
you have just lost my business.
sad?
doing a presentation on the branch to the new cfo.
there we go!
i am- oh, thank you.
that way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
excuse me, sir... dwight!?
I am sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, mose, but she is your aunt too.
thank you.
yes, yes, yes, hi-yes!
sure!
wait, salesaEUR"what sales meeting?

there you are.
it is a tankard.
woo-hoo.
birdie.
jim, this is going to come as no surprise but i know exactly what you are going to say.
sure.
item five, point "b", uh... the beet juice cleanse?
good!
we have a little song prepared for you.
now this was written by toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
absolutely, pam this is exactly why i hired you as office administrator, handle it.
mm, that is not sexual, just... we are all professionals.
how did you know?
i am a mere defender of the office.
you knew that.
i need you.
and every morning i would watch the sunrise and i would eat a mango.
we can do this you guys.
he is, he is like a really mean-spirited guy.
you heard me right.
let me explain something to you.
packer was here and so was your mom!
okay, hold on for a second, folks.
when held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.
but i want you to get pumped about this corner idea.
do you want this open or closed?
this is amazing!
ha, but this one could not see it, or did not want to see it.
i can do that, it is my office.
we will see what dwight says.
i have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.
ok. hold on, hold on.
give me the phone.
really?
so, i have a <i>perfect</i> ice-breaker if i ever meet terry hatcher.
i stole the guest list from jim's desk and i search engined every female on both sides of the family.
why do i have to explain everything?
jim... look at that!
yeah.
nope.
all right, I will be right back.
tonight is the dundies, the annual employee awards night here at dunder mifflin.
oh, breakfast.
you moved it.
we are not doing anything.
wha - god!
one thing about deer, they have very good vision.
ha ha haaEUR you guys are never going to shut down the machine, ok?
try and destroy the old ways, gabe, well i will not let you.
ryan come on up here.
yes, you know what?
pam, productivity starts with patience and determination.
pull over!
oh... goodness... thanks.
let us just say i saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
mmm... whoa.
what is this?
holly, carol, january helene?
the rest of the story has been censored due to- inappropriosity.
life.
he insulted us and he abandoned us.
i might do the spin.
what?
a little "good will hunting" situation.
wow!
stop it!
i know, grumble, grumble.
me too, me too.
neutered by my own building.
now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which i do.
remember?
I am wearing my mustard shirt.
i do not know.
throw pillow?
these are my associates.
i just have an announcement to make.
oh, christ.
and I am going to go with my guy, and that is ryan.
really?
ready?!
money.
great.
two of those, that will land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
leapfrog!
know what?
although I have only seen antz, but I will tell you something.
let us go.
it is about this very announcement you just made.
what is everyone staring at?
that is the best thing?
what is next?
that is how i want every day to be.
they did not have to say it to your face.
all right.
he he.
it is hard to choose.
the second time... i thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.
ah, really gets you in the fillings, does not it?
now come at me!
the crow.
am i in pain?
what do you do?
any other questions?
you did this, did not you?
count the other way.
you are ruining the mood.
eat it.
i figured it would save time.
why do not you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them.
get lost.
come on!
doing!
whoa, whoa.
do we speak english?
and it is not like there was the lone ranger, and tonto, and bonto.
thank you very much.
what do you say?
show of hands, anybody want to intern at dunder mifflin?
i burned my foot!!!
all right first name is tom- all right, okay, okay, you are getting inside my head.
no, not you, pam.
alright who wants to party?
whoa!
behold.
but you know what makes people forget their differences?
oh, pam, i forgot to get you something.
okay, okay, i will be the first to admit it.
i do not miss him.
you are still at the 570 number?
i- a watch would be nice.
this is who i am now.
kelly?
I am just calling to say that i think we need a little break, permanently.
the only thing that makes any sense.
my perfect valentine's day?
why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
"bend it like beckham." yeah.
you get any news about the leads, you try me.
no, it was not.
why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh?
well, obviously, she is brownish.
we cannot let them get away with this.
ask him his symptoms.
can i give you a piece of advice?
then ace.
I will just go by myself.
that is what she said!
but, you will not tell anyone.
and you know what else we are going to do?
and i just want my nephew to work in my pool.
mmhm, i hear you.
all right.
no.
no.
do not sell your implants please.
oh, no.
i know.
yes.
this is where the magic happens.
ugh, alright.
thank you very much.
you are right.
those are not deep fried, right?
okay, so i called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.
go back that is not good.
I am not going to start improv at level one, and i do not think my credits will transfer.
and dental this time.
abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
flat-chested.
stanley!
my mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month.
you can not help people.
because, frankly, it is just a different sensation.
yeah?
rroww!
i knew it!
how can you eat like that?
and i think it is very important that we have this.
no, we would never do that.
she is...  you do not deserve her.
but... hey, cece's toothbrush.
call in a few favors.
that is a stupid game.
dunder mifflin.
so how is that uh, coffee from earlier?
sucker!
okay.
really?
it is like christmas, easter, and halloween-- --rolled into one.
holly like phone?
ah!
martha stewart!
yes, i have acted before.
today I am prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
whether you are scared of dying, or dying alone, or dying drunk in a ditch.
heard you a little bit less that time.
and no one said 'yes' to that either.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
what is that supposed to be?
it is a christmas miracle!
you sent him cards?
oh, god!
i think you have a great accent.
push!
you made me wrap it.
ok, alright, enough with the jokes.
and it is just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
pam!
or, as i like to put it, my family is doubling in size.
so... there is your barrette.
gruel.
do not need it.
val kilmer?
better handling.
what are you?
we looking for him.
thank you.
since I am here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
wow!
lovely!
engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid?
and that is just... I am not better than josh.
that was helping.
this is dwight schrute.
and i... okay.
hey, where you would you like to go next?
jim halpert is smudge and arrogant.
confirmation number: romeo.
special delivery for dwight k. schrute.
here we go.
how is the lady situation?
brain teaser.
well, it says here that it is a 300ft drop.
you are right.
these are human beings.
no, there... later there was.
ok.  healthier.
really?
I will take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just- okay.
also, it is icky back there.
i need a box.
here we go!
corporate policy.
you and the history books.
okay, also, moratorium on cornell talk.
i only did it because i nailed the wave.
yeah.
what matters to you is your precious speed limit.
not to her face, because... well, not because I am scared of her.
i am not being sexist.
our prices have never been lower!
goodbye.
hit him!
that is very disrespectful.
keep it happy.
i suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
karaoke, i love it!
jo, may i speak to you for a second?
all right, all right, all right.
those were probably misdiagnosed.
alright who is next?
and hearing about what a great boss i am.
umm hmm.
mmm.
jim, turn around.
oh andy, got to few questions for you.
do you have those?
yeah.
i looked straight at the bag.
well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can not even find their way to work?
I am trying to save those precious knees you are always bragging about.
that will show  them.
she is pretty and appears intelligent.
although, i will agree that her head is weird.
okay, okay.
you said you did not have plans.
cool.
there she sat.
maybe.
let us see josh replace these people.
what did it say?
what he is not telling you is that he will abandon you.
really good.
what is her number?
here she comes.
oh my god.
okay.
michael?
i mean her hair, clothes, it is all falling off in great big clumps.
toby is the worst human being I have ever known.
you?
you answer it.
no.
spite her - ok oh, stop it dwight.
neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
i, uh, I am done.
i feel better.
i would sleep in my office, and i would sexually harass people.
i am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
ok, no.
you can not be too careful about what you say.
can you smell the trees and the nature?
i need you to see this.
everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
gooooo-tee!
yes, and hear me, dwight, when i say i brought you into this world, and i can take you out.
my diabolical plot is on hold for christmas.
dwight.
angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
let the record show that jim halpert is a liar!
oh yes!
the piggies, or whatever?
okay, hypothetical: a man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots.
because of the euro.
were you going to tell me that you hired james van der beek?
this is not the surprise.
stop trying to figure me out.
actually, it has been withdrawn.
oh, look, a curb.
but maybe i need to be even approachabler.
no, they do not.
well there is no jumping in a triathlon.
especially considering his height to weight ratio.
take it from toby.
sometimes we will just meet in the middle.
really?
actually, it is more of a guy's afternoon in.
that is a demerit.
go out, come back in.
for that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible.
that is all.
want me to come over?
no, dwight.
i have all the time in the world.
you bring dip?
no life, no family.
watch out, pam.
they call it that because of the electricity.
all right.
do you remember ed truck?
am i a mountainous?
no, i was being negligent.
no.
you explain to me how that was fair, and I will explain to you how this is fair.
confidence, dwight.
that is why everybody was applauding for me at the end.
because of the downsizing.
women's appreciation.
it does not matter.
oh i love this song.
no.
and in the morning.
you complained the whole time.
michael, michael, no.
you are just going to somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what is going to be on your tombstone?
i hope he does not haul off and just hit you.
so, deangelo!
but i can give you this pitch in one minute- still an important position.
admit it.
i disagree, i think it was very valuable.
idiot.
thank you, randy.
my mom was marrying jeff.
you should ask karen, she was one of them.
no.
I have already set the bar really high.
he is my... ok. may i please just use your phone?
rain check?
lowest of the low.
you hear stories about dunder mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was.
thank you very much.
yeah, but no nipples.
yeah!
well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.
then you are an idiot.
yeah, oh, hey.
it is bitter because i slightly destroyed a wonderful little family.
I am a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.
ho ho ho!
i promise you, that door locks!
you understand?
just the urine.
the bread is poisoned.
here too.
how strange.
warrantees do not cover it, plus they are a rip-off.
so you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
no no, no, wait, wait, wait  permission to join the validity committee.
okay, i have immunity.
i told them that if they graduated from high school, i would pay for their college education.
right here.
that was a woman i was talking to, so... she had a very low voice.
but we were at the dmv waiting in line.
no.
she bought it?
have any of you talked to dwight?
and in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and i have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.
ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.
andy is like marv something.
and i am obviously the joker.
yeah, I am sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
what do you know?
my last dundies ever.
i will not.
okay, look.
are we ready?
can you make yourself cry?
woohoo!
let me try something, just while we are waiting.
nothing happened.
you are glad?
i love it.
hot and juicy red head.
yeah.
uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic new york style sushi.
what are you going to do if you are by yourself and your heart stops?
oh, good.
was john belushi fine?
<i>I am</i> the head of the company?!
what is your problem?!
i think you are, yes, why do not you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.
good shocks.
ok, press conference in 45.  dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
eat sand, you fat, old man!
the purse girl hits everything on my checklist.
thanks.
look at that!
andy brought some salmon.
would that be crossing the line?
just do your best!
oh, excuse me!
he went over your head to go behind your back.
i can not believe you came.
okay.
oh phyllis, nice try.
just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower.
it takes a big man to admit his mistake.
impossible.
so, without further ado, kelly you are on.
did she say what it is about?
the white pages.
but do you realize that underneath us, there is another world.
I am embarrassed it was even that close though.
cut.
i did not feel much when i held astrid, but i got a good feeling from holly.
ah, i need my entourage  jim.
oh!
hey!
what is it?
dunder-mifflin is the big picture!
i have something i would like to give you.
the odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.
i want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five slough avenue.
i know all that.
i have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood.
what is the vibe of this place?
and I am closing the door.
gahh!
they love milli vanilli down there.
i am on top of it.
hey, what was she like?
rollercoaster!
it is called "curves." i went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in.
this part goes to the, uh, girl.
each tribe will have a leader that i will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking.
right, right.
yes, yes, and yes.
what do you say?
well then my man meat, he shall have.
i just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head.
get lost.
yeah!
read it out loud.
that is what nassau came up with?
alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
good night.
alright, ciao.
that is where they remove the uterus.
jim!
cupids and hearts.
wrong.
and then i had to ride up here with stupid toby.
let us get vanilla.
no, this is a power suit.
this is like the blair witch hunt project.
you know what?
and you are disgusting, dwigt.
what can i say?
pam, would you smell my breath?
.
will you help me work out this knot?
beautiful.
try "michael scott".
had a few laughs along the way.
the boys are back in town.
that is because you are incapable of doing it because you do not know how.
everybody!
yow!
no!
let us go, c'mon.
so, when, um, can i see you again?
so long donna!
or, who was it that suggested the authentic pennsylvania dutch christmas?
as a volunteer sheriff's deputy i have been doing surveillance for years.
ugh, god.
no.
there is a tradition that the hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
john wayne gacy.
michael, once this gets out... i do not know how it is going to go down.
because today we are all kings.
it is about who is the best boss.
does the tiger fire the monkey?
i want to get back.
I am going up to the roof.
no, you do not even know what stupid is.
i hired one musician, because i thought, what is better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
this is all we need.
this ought to be good.
what are you doing?
bathroom checks out clean.
we are going to choose team names.
and this is a guy who loves to start fires.
i think it is inappropriate to date someone you work with.
you have to snare it.
island living.
or that the sport does not exist?
alright.
oh really, jim?
why do not you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
we will start small.
there is no more seats.
that is what she said.
i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
mmhmm.
well, then he is not a senator.
you are not stupid.
yeah!
ok. i do not have a room?
nothing?
i want to be the guy who gives everything back.
no, no, i do not, but-- i... will not.
I am taking his job.
dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work... uh!
hmm.
ha.
all right.
he tortured me... with his awfulness.
yes, darryl, the sales department makes sales.
it just does not work.
jim!
those are the ad guys right there.
thirty-one!
that would be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
i had no idea.
time!
it is true.
oh, yes, great.
darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.
so... you know, it is really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
am i a small number person or a severance package person?
you know what you need?
cool.
pam.
the ones that make you pull the car over and go, "wow, i need this beet right now."  those are the money beets.
she will have a greekaccino.
we sell beets to local stores and restaurants.
with a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there.
you know what?
I am going to give it a ohh!
re-adapt.
what do you want?
bye.
this cord has creed written all over it.
soda.
good.
tell you what.
go.
yes.
pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
put a pin in that.
oscar.
he has no idea!
yeah!
and she got it, she got the suit.
no.
you do not know?
no, you know what?
oh, okay.
we are done!
I am michael scott.
oh, god.
untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys.
listen up, i got some theories.
look at me, phyllis!
this little baby might come in handy.
and i do not care if you are a loser, or you practice bestiality, if jo likes you, you are in.
which will be fine.
ehhhhnt.
happy!
i go down to the police station on my lunch break.
help yourself.
stand up, stand up, stand up.
no, no, no, no, no.
power couple.
just going to... take a... brief pause at this point.
would you like to come to work for the michael scott paper company?
all right.
or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat.
let us give this a shot.
no.
i would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important... yes uh... i want it... i want it to embarrass all other parties.
so, how you been?
be there!
okay.
but, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I am going wherever they value loyalty the most.
yeah.
I have got a madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named andy bernard sold his xterra to a smart and capable man named dwight.
i am headed to philadelphia for the annual northeastern mid-market office supply convention.
the harmoniacs, or the do-re-mi-go's?
i am going to be... kind of a daddy.
lunch.
i was born ready.
nice try, how is your pollack-says-what index?
ok, i see some people who like to buy things.
the boss, hosts, the dundies!
besides i got to get back downstairs.
da  na na na na... this is going to be awesome.
also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
I am a jamaican zombie woman.
all right.
wolves.
i want to have a child for business reasons and i want you to be the mother.
right?
that-that was maybe too much.
dwight, come on... there is no downsizing.
exactly.
pizza.
k... kevin!
it could be behind you or whatever.
and i did not... i never got closure, you know?
you must be andy bernard.
you know what?
come on, let us do it.
please sir!
your stomach?
hey!
they all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift.
i need to know... who shot johnson!
oh... then here we are.
this is improv.
jan levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we are going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
why did you pollute?
hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
you guys hungry?
hi.
i sorta like the old way.
no, that was my sensei.
does everybody want a raise?
you know, so... i know... right.
so just tell her to go away.
aloha and welcome!
man, what is taking toby so long?
come on, it will be fun.
yeah?
all right?
i basically have the job already.
you are thinking of the broad jump.
disarm!
perhaps.
let us go.
yeah, whatever.
god.
what is that?
okay, you are going to make me say it.
great.
maybe I will stay.
what can i do, michael.
he was lying about being sick.
you know what?
i love it.
cocaine.
without its agricultural program, we probably would not have cabbage.
the one man I have been hired to protect?
not the perks.
um... oh, where is that?
well, i guess they do not teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
your concern is noted.
did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
all right.
kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides rogaine?
where is my wallet?
alright.
is this what i drink out of?
did you just ask me if this was a cow?
i do not think you are being totally impartial though, because you have not said one bad thing about pam.
yeah.
because i do not make copies, I am the boss.
everyone here knows that i can not and will not keep a secret.
this is pam beesly,  receptionist extraordinaire.
sometimes you just fail.
do not let us down.
excuse me.
just trying to be your friend.
I am going to need a list of every man you have ever had sex with.
without further ado, ryan?
how did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
we got to do something.
I will see your situation and I will raise you a situation.
i... thanks.
yes!
up in the...  he does not even get to play in the game, i mean.
everybody gets dumped gabe.
i will talk alright.
darryl, this office is mine now.
so.. no it is not.
today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
is she in the fridge?
look, i think we need to set some ground rules.
there goes mister poop.
ooh.
no, this is where i work.
you do not even care about nationals.
those are collectible action figures and they are worth more than your car.
maybe.
dwight's going to take care of you.
a little to your left what is going on?
oh my god.
no, i meant about being single today.
you want rabies?
he is very trusting, he is looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
I am kidding.
and hates your body.
fire in the hole!
oscar is back.
plus you can go, "rule five, see rule six.
i am going to throw you this ball.
so i called my buddy down at the station today.
read the official kitchen regulations memo.
maybe all of them.
oh my goodness.
no.
is he going to offer you the manager's job?
higher salaries.
completely true.
there were only two options.
whoa, oscar!
oh, ok, well I am looking for a passionate affair, not companionship.
hey.
I am the top salesman there and I am looking for a new challenge.
is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
no.
i have like a thousand people over every week to watch it.
oh, my god.
you know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have.
dripping on me.
ha ha.
guy goes fishing with hand grenades.
if you are going number one you have got ten more seconds!
i marked her arm.
you are... it is, it is bugging me.
oh, okay, i get it.
take it easy.
angela, this child is definitely mine.
what?
hey, this is ryan.
it is... i wear it like that sometimes.
that was terrible advice.
next.
the pressure!
dot com!
oh, time and resources.
'specially with me around.
carry on.
so... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire?
I will make you a tape.
and i was five, five years old.
the plo, the ira, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse.
abso-fruit-ly.
uh, it is equal.
i need your urine.
what is up?
well i would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
sounds-  this is dwight shrute.
I will have to talk to the manager.
no.
well, kevin, i guess it is just me and you.
the white pages: do you want it?
i did not, you know, it was... it was dark, for one thing.
morning everyone.
I am sorry.
I am taking two so i can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
it would not be fair.
and that your glasses make you look ugly.
that is nice though.
i cannot work with jim anymore.
and shake!
this morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers i earned my black belt in goju ryu martial arts.
people are mixing, a lot of hope.
we will talk more about that on the boat.
i do not think i could ever give back to you what you have given me today.
push!
i do not know how george bush did it when colin powell left, and if utica thinks that they are going to poach stanley, they have another thing coming.
we better.
so alike.
so i think i know what i need to do at this point.
I will give you a hint.
all right.
relax.
oh he is not that nice.
i want to see some presents.
thank you and good night!
what?
i do not think you would like it up there.
and while we are enjoying these delicious empanadas, jim, why do not you tell us your story again?
mmwwah !
and because of that...i want you to work for me.
just slip it off my--slip it off my hips.
i guess not.
well, we can start this paper company.
no.
thanks.
no arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, kevin.
money is not real ever since we got off the gold standard.
ohh, darryl.
it is... it is so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.
the next time you see me, I will be working for corporate.
yes.
we have only just begun.
you know what this is?
that is what i thought.
you win.
we can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
opportunity, promotion, blah, blah.
you meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that is how you do the scarn!
from when he recommended me to replace him.
so to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts.
i am a local business owner and i would like to find out about your company.
enjoy.
i am told that there are bears in the rockies.
night after night, town after town, all across america.
ryan.
yeah, go ahead and stop.
it consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
you know, uh, something is come up.
i would like you all to give this a shot.
michael scoon, fbi.
let us just run away to jamaica and live in a bungalow.
it does not matter.
jim could not land me in a thousand years.
phyllis?
pam?
thank you so much.
we already have a sofa.
are you going to make another pro and con list?
bummer.
thank you michael, for staying on.
it is kind of smelly, but that might be a plus!
powerpoint!
that will not go over well.
jim, jim, jim.
oh really?
attention, employees of dunder mifflin.
this is a very important wedding for the branch.
had  them all my life.
it is.
i was trying to go- ok, ok. then you know what?
kevin!
all right?
no, no.
yeah, it is kind of... business/romantic.
okay.
yes!
no, no, no, you do not need to go anywhere.
we need more attitude like that around the office.
come on!
give me that.
oh, hey, hey, um, should i bring a dictionary to the hospital?
same places as last week.
that he could turn jan against me?
here we go.
settle town.
because I am going crazy.
ok. all right.
you are!
and then type it up, in a way that is helpful.
that is all.
oh, my god.
whoa-ho.
so, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
how about that?
if you do not get no respect, you might be redneck.
temp!
who wants to fix up .. toby.
yeah... this conversation has two items on the agenda.
had them run a background check on josh porter.
you are going to blow it.
speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms.
who cares?
oh, and I am not?
"michael, it is january i guess i missed you.
okay.
and fourth, getting presents.
okay?
I am losing control of my bladder.
i can not do this.
ok, wait a second.
that is a very, very funny story.
not now, some day.
you have just seen my penis.
listen man, i am so sorry.
i could put in a good word for you, because I will still be working here.
come here.
ah!
now you are not doing your job.
draw his penis.
stanley, as you know, is retiring.
maybe next year.
what do we have here?
okay.
it is not been a blockbuster year for me financially.
the point I am trying to make with all of this people is that i hate drugs.
well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of dunder mifflin, mr. robert dunder.
butter.
maybe we should test it first.
this place has gone to hell.
they hand these out to little kids.
it was not here before.
yeah.
what?
you have only seen it flat.
ok. very good.
i think you know.
she is not here, jim.
dwight schrute here.
and  then another and another and another.
who here is a history buff?
none taken.
well, hi there david wallace.
okay!
the only logical way to find out if donna is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call michael and tell him the sad news.
i do not care.
all right!
well, you know what?
this christmas party is perhaps the best christmas party i have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.
who won the hugging contest?
i am the creative genius.
crisis management squad.
what?
there is some seed money for you.
black-eyed crows.
that is not a toy.
well, that is because you and i have very different tastes and you like lame things.
you smell like tide detergent.
not a wizard, a hobbit.
this expresses how loudly i love you.
jim, you win.
yes.
got enough, weirdo?
you are really annoying me.
haha, i do!
dunder-mifflin, scranton is being shut down.
you can not say that everything is perfect.
no, I am leo dicaprio!
stop it.
they would say things like "do not pay for six months" or "you can transfer your account from another card"... do you think I will get any new ones?
and my decision in final.
wow.
check that out.
ryan?
instead i had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
that is so cute.
it is not going to have a big, fat, gross santa claus.
we broke up on the drive.
are you ready for this, albert?
did you see her face?
nnnnn-dink!
hey.
or a... a whosi-whatsi.
you are not jim!
it is about damn time.
no.
totally undercooked.
i think what andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
oh, yeah.
except, you know what?
do you feel it?
no, no no no no.
clearly a hunter.
okay, let us get this started.
to save on electricity I have installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights.
I am thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we will go month to month after that.
crazy, crazy world.
you know, see if we can catch this pervert.
i would love to live in new york someday.
join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom.
we will find that out together.
then why is there new wood only on one railing?
men's warehouse.
if you do not let me pursue my artistic vision, i am going to walk!
well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire.
he got caught "saving treats" from the kitty litter box.
cool?
we have been friends forever, right?
i, ok, listen.
i do not know, i can imagine her with another woman, can not you?
okay.
i have an idea.
hi.
the eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room.
i think it was someone really popular.
you are like an amish return stick.
I am not insane.
are we smart?
oh my god.
david?
what?
your the only one i trust." no thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble.
who thought it would be hysterical to give toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
i know, because you have no role models.
and i called the temp agency and i told them i will pay you any amount, just give me ryan howard.
no!
just ring me up.
do you understand?
the thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
toby killed this bird.
i thought he was out on the road.
undistributable.
my point is... that as long as people like you and me do not stop talking, nobody can stop the usa.
and business class which was basically just coach.
bring it on.
i hate to do it this way but, you know, that is just... we are having a friendly game.
no.
i... do not see you.
excuse me.
who have i wronged?
yes!
before you guys came in, i was talking to the guys.
and apparently, some people throw up.
stop it!
like e.t.
now nobody knows whether i am here, or whether i am gone.
I am going to win, ha ha, I am the gentleman!
think of pam's nipples as toby's grundle.
what is the problem?
kind of a less urban aunt jemima.
who is it?
yes.
.
clarinet.
we have puzzles, string for cat's cradles.
and not tomorrow, and not the next day.
this gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
when i was growing up it meant lame.
my top salesman, jim halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator pamela beesley halpert is my best friend.
okay, knock it off, rolph.
that is, that is... those are instincts that have been created by media and hype.
the guards are all women.
how do i look?
actually, kevin, you might like it!
told you.
right there.
first i was afraid, i was petrified.
it is the sandwitching hour!
you say, "jump," and he says, "oh who?" he loves to jump on people, that trevor.
we have it on tape, so... i was going to put that in my message, toby.
not even close.
question.
pull up next to each other, give each other the finger... moon each other.
um, nothing.
so... i will see you up there in viagra falls!
you do not have to convince me.
sure.
as has meredith.
you just need to realize that so much rides on this.
hm?
tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet.
yeah.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
great.
oh, god.
permits are pending.
narc!
mmm!
that is what happened.
traitor!
so, mum's the word.
hey, you know what?
why not just sweet?
okay, I am just going to use the bathroom, and then I am going... it is actually better this way.
he -- please, mr. buttlicker -- please give me another chance.
you are all jerks.
oh, okay.
i do not even know if I will want a baby in eight months.
also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
so?
you know, i like you.
thanks.
that ties right into new attitudes.
okay.
i love that face.
come on, i mean i do not even know what they do.
no, no, no, no.
i do not like you, but because some town in switzerland says so, you have rights.
I have never been a big fan of the name dunder mifflin.
stand clear.
welkommen, bienvenue, and welcome to monte carlo!
well, they are sold out.
hey shut up.
yes i am telling you you have to get tested for herpes.
you can not put a price on freedom.
wait, i see you every day.
it is all toby's fault.
last i checked, that is not an office building in the andromeda galaxy.
god.
unh!
you nailed it.
yep.
no, it is not that bad.
at six?!
he gives me leads and i take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good.
i said i was only going to say this once.
no deal.
and perhaps, some pam-chops, with mint... I am looking for the toy drive box.
no thanks.
yeah.
but do not forget you owe me $10.
we liked the last guy, siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist.
jim is like big bird.
you think kids in africa have chairs?
I would say i have gotten along with my subordinates.
ha!
no, you are not.
ugh.
when i was sixteen, i was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named julie.
they are unrelated.
oh- god!
oh gee, then why do i have an office?
i was a hell raiser.
hey!
and what happened?

well, we have been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing i know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
whenever you are ready.
definitely.
you got a lot of anger under there buddy.
what is going on?
i would like to have all the racists brought together and take darryl philbin out to lunch.
enough of this garbage.
well, i am heading down there.
he gave you everything.
do i see somebody in the back?
alcoholic.
yep.
so you think you know a lot about business?
we had to let him go.
so please, uh, make yourself at home.
side of candied pams.
i do not think we need to do this.
no, michael!
and when i came to, i had an epiphery.
let us hear it!
oh, and you know what, darryl?
but if we are the three musketeers... hey guys, great response time.
this meeting is for knights of the night only.
you know what you have to do.
300, we have 300.
please.
and i am in the wedding party.
and i say, who wants to be in an institution?
i got egg all over my face.
before we get started i wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies.
slim jim.
um... so are you in down this weekend?
i got sofa.
sorry about that.
it is by the ream?
just go with the copy paper.
you listen good.
sorry.
maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?

have you ever seen santa?
the person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.
i have a lot of ideas for new directions.

you look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
look, it does not matter what you say.
god!
idiot.
erin would like a few words with you.
no.
bye poochie!

and you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses.
there are several penises there I would love phyllis to run her eyes over.

good work.
hey michael?
rolf is my best friend, and he is the man.
oh i do not know, um, what if there is a tornado, pam?
oh, thank you.
good.
give him to me.
flower shops, fireworks celebrations... moolit gandala, carrage drive through central park... an electric car dealership.
he looks like your twin.
fun, right?
okay.
oh, I am sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me.
whatever you want.
oh, my god.
and good for them.
you will be thin.
nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
badda bing, badda boom.
go!
well, in a sense.
that is what she... kind of in the middle of something here.
what?
can you just- can you just act normal for a second, please?
listen.
i guess this could be the one, huh?
go!
alright.
hey.
and also, i want you to spread the word that i will have my digital camera.
what you people do not know about business, i could fill a book with.
and that you were the blind one.
hello everyone, i am michael scott.
hey, it is cool, man, i work in the warehouse!
michael scott.
who is the king of england?
we would have twins.
sound good?
because it is an idea.
uh oh!
this is war and that is what happens.
oh really?
she is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office.
in case michael or andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day.
names, numbers.
fact: you are talking to jim.
that is the most flavorful bond.
we are never going to find those leads, are we?
you are just as stubborn as your mother, when you do not want to do something you just do not do it.
this, my friends, is the master bedroom.
flash floods.
that sounds great.
pam and jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.

for her.
there is nothing you can do.
but, you know what?
with the molten hot lava of strategy!
birthday lunch.

i think it did.
trip advisor is the life blood of the agrotourism industry.
i call her hillary rodham clinton.

blindly.
do not ask me for a raise.
my heart's still racing.
who are you talking to?
and tuck in your shirt, you are the face of this company.
delicious.
i begged you to pretend to be chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be chuck!
they are rushed to the hospital.
alright.
where?
they told me i need to let somebody go.
we are back.
i thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
then i go to sleep.
god!
what?
it is an advice question, and if you do not want to talk about it, i completely understand.

your advice was good, but jan's was bigger.
they are happy down there in the furnace room.

plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
if you are here for the grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.
i did it.
on one hand i want to be honest with jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I am afraid she is going to dump me.
but i would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
run!
it- yep, recently.
take off your shoes.
i will gladly pay you tuesday for a hamburger today.
we have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white?

ok, I will punch you.
i wonder what is going on.
oh wow!
we have a big meeting with the chief buyer for frames select, steve nash.

nice of you to come today.
uh, who else we got... um...ok, all right, you guys.
hello.
it can not have two players.

absolutely i would not.
no, just tell me what it is.
oh, monkey.
louder!
is this what you are saying, grasshopper?
michael!
and women have sex before marriage and i think we need to celebrate that.
you are right, i did not even think of him.
stupid.
okay, what are you doing?
jim.
a good manager does not fire people.
look, men are visual creatures.
this is, uh, the hardest thing I have ever had to do.
you know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, i have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so i think we should pull the trigger and - all right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
come on.
ok, dwight.
put some ice on it.
i bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
last week i would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.
"the dundies, how can i explain it?
you know, darryl is actually the foreman here and not roy, which is cool.
hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster?
so, phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now i am recruiting you.

i can not go through with this.
the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit.
do you know who the real heroes are?
okay, good.
all right.
no!
i know, here we go.
back to work, everybody.
i took the liberty of making a list of everyone who did not follow you in here.
mhmm.
ah, pet day.
you are not going to paris.
why are you playing the national anthem?
it has to be a real person jim, come on.
he is an idiot.
you know what i just wanted to remind you about the game today.
i would have, except i did not know about it.
come to papa... oh yes.
now she knows what it is like to be a minority.
i guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment.
okay, wow!
there you are.
where is the funny?
I am sorry.
have a seat.
i guess it does make sense buying from a father son team.
no.
you know what?
i imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo.
everybody takes the subway in new york.
good thing it is working.
and her boyfriend will die.
there you are.
oh... crap.
"scranton area paper company, dunder mifflin, apologizes to valued client.

we got it happening now.
baaaat!
jan is calling me.
what kind of sauce is on your salmon?
I am not in this for the trophies, but... well, technically, I am a co-manager, and i barely have any responsibilities, but i work hard, i love this company, and for those reasons, i think i would make a good employee of the month.
well here we all are.
and talking to them today, i do not feel for them anything like what i feel for you.
fine, fine.
angela, oscar, and kevin.
yes, i did, for you, princess.
what I am offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing.
what do you want me to do tonight?

no, they can not.

well, if that is what i am required to do, i will do exactly that.
i hate, hate, hate being left out.
was bob hope fine?

mmhmm, china.
listen, i like kids.
yep, all right.
watch this.
but he is an everyday guy.
that is not what wallace told us.

because while i was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
I am actually having trouble focusing on my job.
I am happy sometimes.
they did this up in albany... and they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so... well, I am their boss, so i feel like... anybody want any coffee or... women in the workplace... yeah, translation "i have been banned from my own conference room so that jan can talk in secret to all the girls." oh!
that is a serious offense.
you know what?
you see, it is on my periphery and if i needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow.
no, i was not asking you.
pam.

ah.
i have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile.
i will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.

when i left staples, i took some of their leads with me but i never intended to use them.
but that is a risk we have to take.
what do you need?
dwight brought glasses and a person.
april 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
it is okay guys... i can handle this.

I am trying to be a good mentor.
hi, jan!
ok, everybody, let us suck in our guts.
i think you should do that.
blood, urine, or semen.
um, i wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she is allergic to hay.
okay.
let us do it!
oh my god.
I am glad i signed.
anyone?
i see your voice in the phone.
I have never met anyone who does that.
what, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'?
your choice.
does not it worry you in the slightest that jim is not his real name?
i was in that marriage arena, though.
thirty.
pull over!
i am eating alone.
go ahead.
cool, cool, cool.
i made a miraculous recovery, which is more than i can say for him.
maybe a whole theme, like a rap.
um... that is what i was thinking, with the farm, so... you getting to wherever I am going to put my thing.
i do.
that shady grove out by willard's pond.
ahhh.
your company is losing clients left and right.
oh, that sounds awesome.
that is how sure i am that this accountability booster is going to work.
i traded a thumb tack for meredith's junk for kelly's crap for phyllis' garbage for oscars trash for stanley's garbage for ryan's junk for creed's garbage for a very cute squid that erin happened to have.
no, no, no.
love is a mystery.
all right!
oh... really.
i need to see if they are dilated.
obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I am going to like it.
oh, god!
see you guys tomorrow.
you write your sandwich on it.
okay.
why do not you work with  phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that i can post around the community?
kevin, not now.
thank you.
ryan is going to be the main event today.
okay, all right.
because i could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.
no, I am not there to make friends.
it is not anything you would have ever done.
if i were you, I would just bunk with cathy.
it is not even a twirl, it is a spin.
it was ryan.
okay.
it might be innate goodness versus innate badness?
not so fast.
moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life.
grade 'a' gossip for you, right now.
ok, you know what, i mark it urgent a, urgent b, urgent c, urgent d. urgent a is the most important, urgent d you do not even really have to worry about.
I am thinking about getting something german, something with decent gas mileage.
all right, everybody.
what they do not understand is that i bought the stuff to impress potential clients.
ahh!
uh, well, jim and i got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
very good!
yes.
yes.
yeah.
i am truly impressed.
ahh!
emergency dentist appointment.
check in time is now.
so this is his strike two.
your path from obesity begins right here!
good.
thank you.
angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she is in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.
sounds good.
hello, everybody?
so well-loved.
check this out.
absolutely everything was the same.
i could not sleep last night.
eventually, they will rise up and revolt.
you!
good.
I am over it.
it really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
little homework over here?
but first, you got to tell me what your goal is.
my deepest condolences.
long story.
i love him.
and i think we need to break up.
or pukey.
what is going on in here?
uhyeaahhh!
see ya!
you?
who quits?
hey, are you texting?
and that is why i have taken care of everything.
back off.
not at all.
eighty thousand dollars a year.
let us go.
you, in tight pants, michael, are a salami to a black bear.
we will come back at... how is  4:45?
young sir, would you like a free pancake?
you will see.
ummm, well I would have to talk to my mother and my guy at h and r block.
my name's michael scott.
seat belts fastened, folks.
then i contacted the authorities.
uh, knock, please.
why tip someone for a job I am capable of doing myself?
of michael scott!
someday, we will both get together in comstock hall and just laugh about all of this.
yep, i did.
okay.
in the schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention.
afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
jim could not even stay till the end of the party.
that is how it is done.
pssh, stupid.
good, good.
hmmm.
it is whoever, not whomever.
they are in a whorehouse.
i have been hustled.
no, i do not think i ever did.
yes!
one of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time.
that was-- that was a-- that was a really good choice.
all right, time's up!
i could fire you.
no, just power it down.
where should we put this?
i need clean urine for the lady.
mm-hmm.
michael, i would like to be the elf.
whoa!
I am going to find gabe, tell him what jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
i do.
now, one at a time, i want you to express your feelings using "i" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements.
how 'bout the suggestion box?
can not set  them up like that.
why do not "we" take a vote on it?
I am on it.
the lincoln assassination just recently became funny.
i did, so... calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend.
i do not even consider myself a part of society.
who knows?
do i go for the vault?
this one really smells like vanilla.
and we are, after all, a paper company.
hey jim.
it- it- i already have my european girlfriend.
margaret thatcher said that about marriage.
oh, just so you know, it is not me, it is you.
okay.
you know what else?
morning announcements!
man, look at that.
i am great.
i just... i just want a little taste of it.
also i would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our... trouble.
toby, katy.
it is my sumo suit.
dwight, what are you drinking?
if i were you, charles miner, i would watch your step.
okay.
no, you do not.
no, i can not drive.
ok, ready?
listen.
i... uh, well, i do not know.
good morning.
they are going to be hard, they are going to be dirty.
bagel bites or something.
eventually lawyers were brought in.
ugh.
ryan!
was this year's dundies a success?
you never talk to jim.
thank you very much.
ryan, you are my son.
maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.
no, i do not want to do that because I am twice your size anyway.
and, god...  that is my phone.
you can say whatever is in your heart.
well I am looking at a photo, right now.
okay.
well.
carry on.
if i ever start acting like that weenie gabe i want you to take that gun, and i want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I am dead.
I am guessing he is some kind of close romantic friend.
stanley knows what I am talkin' about.
who is the boy toy?
yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.
hey santa!
i got a splinter.
i will not be your valentine.
agreed.
i was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
yes.
maybe I will see an accident one weekend?
apricot.
okay.
... please do not send dwight!
okay, cool.
people... everybody does it.
because your bros are always there for you.
she was so innocent.
thank you.
what is going on?
you are making it sound kind of lame.
my first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
there we go.
that is what jim and dwight thought.
sorry to interrupt.
listen up.
nature's viagra!
this is the most important day of the year.
wait.
i was not talking literally, creed.
you feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it is really sad because everybody thinks you are a loser...  stop.
this is ridiculous!
I will make you a mix.
yes.
let us get him inside.
psst!
i come from a long line of fighters.
that is what she said!
go bag!
</i> after three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, i have finally completed my movie, threat level: midnight.
i would kill bin laden and then toby.
carpenter ants.
where are the yams?
i do not understand a word of it.
just, girlfriend.
I am going to count down from ten.
jim, I have given you this information, like, twenty times.
they poisoned my mind.
that is insane.
and it is terrible.
okay then who wants to watch the rest?!
what?
shh.
just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger.
uncool.
please, you must do one thing.
scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
hey.
ah.
well i do not have all the pieces yet.
uh, it appears we are one bathrobe short.
camel cigarettes did the same thing with joe camel by making him look like a penis.
he is trained as a grief counselor.
this machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.
stop it!
well.
they make you come back and clean it up!
ahhhh... maybe neither.
and this is erin and she is going to shave my face.
and instead of a wolf, i cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
ryan!
yes, jim.
you idiot.
all right.
oh my god.
the late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.
goodbye toby!
you are mean girls.
cuts?
okay, what i would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to toby flenderson?
dwight has something he would like to say.
you are going to be okay, monkey.
we need to cushion her head.
we resolved a lot today, everybody.
how many people can i fire?
i did not-- i did not interrupt when you were having your presentation.
you think the epa would ever allow that much deet?
define scorched earth policy.
angela.
alright, I will do it.
ah.
no, we can not.
it is got a lot of me.
sir, would you do the honor?
just ugly enough to have deniability.
so, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want.
maybe use them.
michael, i know what you are thinking.
yeah, yeah.
sorry i freaked you guys out - aah!
how about this?
you have had lobster before, right?
so, I am a little overwhelmed.
hi, I am just going to get this for a sec... just a sec.
i would love a glass, if you are going to open it.
very nice.
guh-od.
adult cut plus.
child's play.
something about that seems inappropriate.
ok. yes, right in here, come on in.
thanks for having me.
I am caring, I am generous, I am sensual.
no, i think they are talking about me.
I will give you a hint.
would not that be fun?
officers, i reveal to you the perpetrator.
and, well, jim.
I have been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?
sign this.
no, we can do it during the day.
uh oh, what is dwight going to get?
fine.
ten seconds!
exit points people.
hey.
so it is not a free fall?
what is the problem?
the electric city.
oh, oooh his mistress.
yep.
my future prospects at sabre?
put it on your fore... do not look at the card.
mm.
i do not, i do not want to live like that.
ah, I am not interested.
darryl moved it.
we have the dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it is sexy, it is sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?
doubt it.
no, no.
win over any man in my guild.
ok, well, i did not say to write your name down, did i?
oh, not likely.
it is what is for dinner!
i talked to corporate, and they told me that i can only give you a 5% raise.
i just do not understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
hey- please, kevin.
no, no , no, you know what?
have you seen gabe?
she is hard and severe.
oh, dear god.
dwight schrute, I am a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called dunder mifflin.
all right jim.
you can run, but you cannot hide.
i say we fill michael's office with bees.
non-organic family farmers.
great sportscaster.
okay.
dwight, there is no way i can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
three reams!
look.
they are complimentary.
and do not call me shirley.
"in addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schrute." who wants to take paintball lessons?
yeah!
easy there, old girl.
have you heard of paper?
stanley, you love your sudoku and your puzzles, i bestow upon you, my felt.
he hated fun.
go move some paper!
you know what, i better hold off.
check out the cathedral ceilings.
...oh no.
you are ruining it, already.
okay.
look at his face!
we are not allowed to use the baler.
he was in the backseat.
right.
i do not have a second job.
that guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
great!
i got thirsty.
reminds me of easter.
very smart.
please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
ok. yeah, what, what?
it was not.
i do not have time for parties i do not have time for tv shows.
andy.
what was that?
and for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "serenity by jan" what do you think about that?
what?
the joke's on you goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.
all right.
okay, careful, he is slouching.
it is european, ok?
pam, I am going to need some help writing a want ad.
you are out of order.
reject a woman and she will never let it go.
okay, now try zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, one.
sometimes i imagine what it would be like to be a woman.
hello hello!
now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
you should not be apologizing to packer.
i think this is going great.
let us go.
definitely.
it is not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it is not even a scheme per se, it is...  ... i have to go make a call.
because... I am awesome!
ahh!
and... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I am crying, and nobody can hear me, because i am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
do you have everything, guys?
fosters in the big can.
dwight schrute, assistant regional manager.
please?
oh.
very, very much.
i would like to use the bailer.
alright.
we sure would love to see them.
time to make the donuts.
and i consider oscar a friend.
shake it, shake it!
because at the end of the night, brad or angelina would have to come and pick him up and i would get to meet them.
double mocha latte, please?
all right.
okay, you know what?
uh huh.
great.
i see you have met computron, our virtual helper.
if anything i gave it to her.
check.
um... look guys, I am sorry.
i bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you would never touch  them, because of your condition.
my boo, holly.
good to see you.
it is as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness.
you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand.
ok, temp.
you talkin' to me?
i would like you to meet andrew bernard.
i always thought darryl and pam might get me fired for something i said.
the more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy playstations and beanie babies.
it is far too early to tell.
and now, i realize that you can program or download any ring you want.
oh hey, jim.
no.
hello, traitor.
no.
i dunno.
there is a pebble in there.
that is exactly what i said.
post-its.
ready?
here we go.
well this is going to hurt like a mother.
i was not given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me.
so you just rat me out?
whoa.
enjoy the show.
was anyone killed?
yeah.
that is where they remove the uterus.
give me the job!
because we do not have a lot of time.
not the way i taught you!
day 44, go.
do you want me to find out what it says?
come on.
who knows how words are formed.
and we like each other.
a boss's salary is not just about money, it is about perks.
what have i learned from all of this?
luke, seriously.
I am positive.
i think we... go together so well.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
uh,  "I will help, elwyn dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword." ok, so, let us put together a starting line-up, shall we?
no footprints.
after what you did?
see ya later, trevor.
okay, look, i know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the dundies this year.
believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
i was going to, i wanted to.
you have to tell him what you did.
city so nice they named it twice.
beat that!
you should not have been, because you were dealing with michael scarn.
whoopty doo.
but I am the first in the office?
that was weird.
lonely people mixing with one another?
dwight, the honors.
I will do it.
I will be in my office if you need me.
i have to have an emergency crown put in.
okay, great.
and i framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
michael scott here.
easy.
remember?
we are livid.
i do not have time for your tv show.
next suggestion.
what do you think?
this is slander, ms. black.
yeah, pretty much.
opus dei.
good?
ring it!
some panties or... pick a thong or... g-string.
what is going on?
the dundies are about the best, in every, one of us.
the other side serrated for maximum damage.
oh my god.
get out.
plenty of space in the parking lot.
um... I am trying to think of what we could sell.
i am busting a gut.
umm... yeah.
yeah.
hey.
mm, good stuff.
oh no... jan had the baby and michael was not there to mark it.
five, four, three.
angela.
that is not true.
hey packer, i made you some hot chocolate.
we are not worthy.
I am fine, I am totally fine.
and you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.
okay, um, count me in as who cares.
i mean, not because you are gay.
I have never quit anything in my life.
i wish i could make potato salad that good.
but this  seems to be... i know how.
I have been told that I am a tactile learner.
come on.
well, everybody, you remember holly.
that is his profit.
is there a god?
are you kidding?
I am going to do it now.
and the wild west.
here we go.
they took my card away because i spent $80 bucks at a magic shop.
alright, see if you can guess what this is.
hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you dwight junior and how much you loved that?
you need a seat buddy?
white people love pizza.
the opposite of that.
yeah.
so, what is the joke?
r thinks he is too good to be here, and p is not as much fun without jim.
alright?
i totally lost it, because i was half-baked.
yeah, right.
michael scott, regional manager, dunder mifflin.
i can not hire clark.
why do not you grow something that everybody does like?
phyllis.
that is what she said!
so, i hired my best friends.
show of hands.
as a matter of fact, I am going to give you some seed money.
this is going to be good.
snakes are waterproof.
no.
hmm?
wait, i did not hear a thing you just said.
would you try- bungee jumping?
he gets it back on friday.
women can not have fun if they do not feel safe.
you are a mom.
you two, jersey state girls, let us go.
alpha male, go buy your wife a pie.
so we are talking constantly all the way.
if you are a chain-smoking acrobat.
it is super duper."  i do not know, something like that.
awesome.
you know what, I will pay for it.
i do not care.
assistant regional manager.
thank you.
let us go check out the master bedroom.
computron?
why have i stayed at dunder mifflin for so long?
do you get it?
he does not daylight as your plumber.
come on.
they invited me to their hospitality suite where i  had free food and it was delicious.
ah, me so horny.
that is a golden ticket idea.
I would go with the rows.
come on, show me excited!
you could be referring to anything.
in my second life i was also a paper salesman and i was also named dwight.
and overqualified.
alright.
would you like fries with that?
there is no movie called willy wonka.
no, no, no.
i do not understand.
okay, dwight.
huhhhh, did you have johnny carson in your land?
no, singles only, singles only.
do not get into that now.
um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an eta when this is going to... you are starting, you are kind of losing them.
no.
but... bye, bye.
i will even let him die.
you know what?
i read small business man.
or some pad thai.
I will do your laundry for a month!
a person who works in this office.
I am workin' for the week.
I am going to kill you for firing me.
you know, we are going to have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
because she is not our customer anymore.
that is not big picture.
i would say that she raised me, but let us not kid each other.
i do not.
no, no.
someday i can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here.
that laugh is so infectious.
holly, i did not mean to do it.
for that, i do have to thank my appendix.
stop.
dogfighting.
i would love a place where we could meet older <i>girls</i>.
aah!
that felt good.
oh.
fictional.
remember?
yeah, steve, whatever his name is.
I am sure bavon gets sick of his job, too.
hey!
i do not feel like peanut butter.
come-i mean, what is the point?
gladly!
what do you grow in here, bullcrap?
let us go!
jim.
close your eyes.
he is not afraid of anything.
come on, egghead.
my minds made up i am not going to change my mind you can not talk me out of it.
what about you, kevin?
one crisis at a time.
I am like butch cassidy, and michael is like mozart.
well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame.
ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it is own sake.
that is very funny.
you know, i should make you a mix.
i just want you to treat me like you would some family member who is undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.
right!
i heard it that time. ]
how do i not make any more of it?
has anyone checked how dilated she is?
...i say you will miss our service, and i absolutely guarantee you will come back.
ah.
i do not understand the reference.
oh, that is a shame.
there he is, the birthday boy!
hey.
anyone?
dunder mifflin's treat.
all right, who did this?
come on.
martin nash.
let us get down to business.
he asked me to do this just for him.
they should not be in that room.
no.
uh, hey... creed?
mmm.
come on, man!
I would come anywhere to see a turtle?
oh.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
let him walk across these coals.
I am supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops?
that is great.
tasty, terrific pizza.
probably about the extremes of the human physique.
a document called "dear michael." i should not have done it.
it is out of my reach now.
it is nuts.
thank you.
right.
uh, i need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
oh, uh oh, I am turning you down right now.
ahhhhh.
anybody?
it is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
can i just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
leaving pennsylvania.
no!
I will try brookstone.
aaaaaaaa!
do not be shy.
you can go on your singing audition.
must eat more jims.
no!
so i think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be  a king of hearts.
i just need to cross some t's and dot some i's.
darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?
you know what?
i want you to get the tambourine.
amazing.
well if you need me, I will be on the other side of that wall.
I have got his back.
arriba!
he loves... other things as well.
how many of these are you familiar with?
yeah I am serious.
i have faith in you.
wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I am completely overwhelmed.
you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you are just some terrible monster.
yeah, it is... freaking cold out here.
I am going to take you home michael.
I will get it.
ryan!
michael, could i talk to you for a second, please?
yes.
okay?
oh, four and a half hours?
the ancient dutch art of screwing up your own team.
come on.

there are ... 4 corners in this room.
ok fine, ignore me.
not one of our harder workers.
on the count of three, it is showtime.
mose or the real mose?
did you have time to think about my offer?
best hr rep that dunder mifflin has ever seen.
I am kind of sick of the attitude around here.
if this were russia, yeah sure.
laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
well... he is the longest baby in this room.
oh man.
has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
come on.
no.
that was an intelligent comment.
there is a sure fire sale, but it is a two man job.
wait, hold, hold, hold... so it is true?
blood everywhere.
that one says, "i am so lame." know which one i want?
i did not want to cast a pall over our fun beach day.
him or me?
hello?
dwight schrute.

catherine.
okay, fine!
I would like to apply for a loan.

so roy is actually going to be marrying pam sometime this summer.
so important.
angela.

do you really want to know?
i still hear it.
maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.
they say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.
david?

yes.
i bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.
stupid.

right?
what kind of stuff is that?
pam, no, no.
what, I am, totally being serious.
continue.
ok. hey you guys.
what was... if he had just waited and heard what i had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
change the location of the meeting at the last second.
i want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
but- good morning everybody.
well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'stop because i want you to stop' or stop as in 'stop.
so effective immediately i am promoting you from assistant to the regional manager to assistant regional manager.
now, we are getting three people each.
it is going to be good, it is going to be a great bachelor party man.
also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger.
okay.
i need backup.
i have an idea.
you know it is really more for a bachelor pad.
investing in real estate.
i will have to answer.
pull it over.
...and products!
what is the matter with... me?
we will give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
get out.
no, i insist.
go away.
because if it is i just do not see the point.
you are okay!
i got it.
and now your wish will not come true, so that blows.
i want you to update all the emergency contact information.
get out of here.
the fun just dried up.
you must use a lot of paper.
and that is when his head was separated from the rest of him.
and i will be taking questions.
you know what?
that would be cool, though.
a dart?
whooo, nice.
well, kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my english and start making some suggestions.
where does paper come from?
let us discredit these rumors.
oh, man, i knew it.
i know.
i... all right.
all right!
woah.
thank you.
hey, hey!

and say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
picture someone doing something heroic.
jim taking the initiative.
but your face does look like the guy from operation.
oh, you know what?
you are all on a time out.

when jim is gone, andy and i are in charge.
yeah.
all that is left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward.
i cannot believe this, you are sending packer to florida?
good stuff.
ahhhh!
it is like a time bomb... ...is ticking down.
ooh!
maybe have lunch together?
that is our next event.
one mississ... ok, you went that far on one mississ.
today is toby flenderson's last day.
blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle... ...in a bitter battle..hey, hey!
yeah.
what?
it is got to be something else.
foul!
you can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want.
there it goes.
so, uh, probably the question.
to protect me.

a sudden burst of light.
f and c, doubletime.

i want you to bring the garbage out.
ok, ryan.
ok?
no, i did not.
yes i do.
c'mon, we are going to asian hooters.

i still try to be a friend first, but... you know?
jim, please no loopholes.

even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
i have to go.
safety is...  on.
all right.
okay, sorry, let us, who else?
no.
hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.

dwight.
now I am going to ask you again.
i did it.
long day.
okay?
we will.
fine with me.
combination spf/repellent.
and within each clue is a lesson.
welcome, welcome.
hey, kevin.
ok, that is our street!
i thought i could see dunder mifflin.
uh, i have an announcement.
and just want to state for the record that i am intending to sue jim for acute psychological distress.
actually it is really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game.
that was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul.
very messy.
make this a priority.
oh, ho, ho, ho.
well, well, have we been blessed today.
yeh.
he had no sense of humor and i proved him wrong in so many ways.
that is great.
ye... pfff.

you are a thief of joy.
you can not have someone murdered.
wow.
we are supposed to use toby.
come on.
what started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
that is not important, jim, i just think we should not listen to any of that crap.
i do!
who is the birthday?
kevin, i can not decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke.
boom!
i think you need to say good bye.
you are out of order.
it is uh, it is in beta testing.
hello.
does anyone here have fermented mare's milk?
pretty good.
who is playing with the button?
please!
you know, i will be honest with you... about something.
you leave, you do not get food.
what?
shut it.
mr. james halpert!
it is got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
what?
the problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it is scary or bad, but i do not.
they are smaller than we are.
you kind of have your foot in both camps, why do not you do the uh, jump ball ok?
I have already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
and we will wait.
there is a decision that needs to be made, and I am having an unbelievably a busy day.
who was it?
kevin, i have something for you.
it is uh, it is uh, very sexual.
no, no, oh, my god!
is that the right answer?
this is plenty complicated.
or...  a whatchamacallit .
okay, why not?
my girlfriend carol is coming to our party tonight, and i have a little surprise for her.
would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?
poor richard's number seven?
some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.
no, no, no.
so, yeah, I am in pain.
free underwear!
not really so much.
we can now sell hammermill products.
how do they do this so fast?
you drive, i got a car full of fox meat.
i specifically went on vacation so i would miss it.
i do not know i think we have done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day.
yellow for cowardly.
because i was thinking we could go to this concert.
okay, okay, we do not have much time.
what is that?
oh my god.
okay, check it out.
just... hey, kiddo.
it is got my cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number.
so check out how we live they call it scranton.
work starts at nine.
and they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.
i like the sound of that.
i do not want to waste your time, and i would not dare waste mine.
i need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration.
you can not leave yet.
last year, idiot!
ok?
we will dig a trench.
really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and... no, your job is being my friend, pam.
oh, thank you, erin.
huh?

he killed an entire family of raccoons.
there is a guy, there is a guy.
i wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars.

i can get into cornell, but he does not know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.
i do not get it!
oh, I am equipped... i can... do not tell michael... punishment fits the crime, i accept.

and then we will see who is laughing.
dwight, little help with the bags, please.
a sale or a lead or... ah.
no.
knock, knock.
i do not need your permission.

why?
happy birthday.
click on guest list.
oh, wow, sleeper hold.
ok, well i know.
goodbye jim.
i think you are over-thinking it.
the scranton zoning board has a strong bias against beet farmers.
okay.
do you think we are going to have sex tonight?
my sensei, ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a sempai.
do we have a desire to dominate the retail space?
regardless.
come on!
am i nomadic?
i knew it.
and then cnn does a story about it.
this is so, so stupid.
and it also helps if you have had five shots.
hey, look at me, I am a baby!
pam, michael scott.
what the hell is that?
get off, get off.
there was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my tv.
we all have ears.
pam beesley ladies and gentleman.
nothing.
happy diwali!
if you applied this to your regular work, you will not even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
after work you guys... yes.
no!
phyllis, stag, i assume.
here we go.
it is her back.
i am still the same old michael scott.
no, that is a german woman named urkel grue.
man, i know how you feel.
i lied to michael.
uh, nope.
no.
yep, yep, yep.
i thought we could have some nice small talk about it.
good morning, vietnam!
ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
guys, guys- that is okay.
he... does his family know?
the mountains.
this is mike tyson.
when we rented 'armageddon'... ... he cried at the end of it.
but in a way the most valuable thing here was not the telescope at all.
no, no, no, I will talk to her.
you alright?
great, right up there.
what are you talking about?
it will be nice to see everyone again.
you are not going to play basketball.
he is in an all-out sprint.
hi stranger.
um... literally two seconds?
man, how long have we been sitting here?
i have something to do.
whatever it is that you are doing, and I will see you monday.
and frankly, killing it lately.
well, i guess it is time, that i turn over the keys, to the famous sebring.
the shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: perfectinschlag.
i would like to give the rest of my belongings to michael scott.
is that the last year the data was available?
oh, yes, hello, how are you?
michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.
what?
and the sentence, death.
watch that i do not hit my corroded artery here... there we go.
that is good.
are you kidding me?
sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady.
well, phooey on that.
good luck.
no, i will not even consider it.
dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of essos as featured in the superb home box office series, game of thrones.
see how papa takes care of you?
all right, just relax, keep your pants on.
ok. that is ok. that is not a problem.
my real beef with her, though, pam?
i thought you had to pee.
cell phone?
very rude.
