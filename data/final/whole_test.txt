but we did not have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
sure.

but then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what?
they do not even have paper.
hey!

you did?
but we are bonding down there!
okay, you know what?
how are you?
and now he wants to know what i think.
damn it.
this is directly in a blind spot, so I am trained to respond negatively to something right above my head.
women are like wolves.
when bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate.
on one condition.
so that should tell you something.
calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike.
battlestar galatica.
now I have got a beard, and i can do whatever i want, and I am your boss.
out of, like, 18 billion americans, so, no worry.
really?
it always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise.
I am writing something.
that guy.
ok?
all of you feel like my family.
thank you.
and, I will be honest, i have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
come on!
oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
my maternal grandfather was the toughest guy i ever knew.
you do not crack a case.
it is just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.
chuck e. cheese?
holly... you know, if we hung holly from the ceiling, we would have to kiss underneath of her.
and now he hates me.
i just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation.
top of the sunday morning to you.
and now we are wasting tape.
also, you.
you know what?
no, creed, no they are not.
hit the nos.
because they saved the worst for me.
you could throw it all day long.
i-i have a business to run.
because i will have you know that that was consensual.
you know, he is just a normal new york city cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up.
oh, god!
which one is that again?
i had to make andy my number two.
well you look cute as a button.
I will stay for ten.
tonight the scranton business park is having casino night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall.
i need to take.
well it can wait.
it is like  dave died or something.
this is a farm and cemetery!
what are they?
you really think hank is going to be loyal to you?
I will try and think of one.
do you smell that?
it is kind of nice... it is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful.
oh-oh.
also, i can not wear this anymore.
cop a squat.

how are you phyllis?
well, that is baloney, because grief is not wrong.
"i need to see this play like i need a hole in the head."  and i hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious aids joke.
over one billion sold.
coal miners, crab fishermen, dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs.
I am going to dig it out of the trash!
you just have to remember, you know- where you come from, and who you are.
goodbye toby!
oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
i just, i need something kind of embarrassing, you know.
you want to be santa?
it is how they wrestle in a blow-up suit...  that will tell me all i need to know  or how sumo... david!
when you use something to block- i think everybody knows what i am talking about.
like everybody else.
yeah, right here.
busy!
you are ok. you are ok. let us lie down.
no.
i did do it!
dwight's a jerk!
small?
and we have to establish a pee corner!
it was a trick question.
that is the game.
ok. all right.
i did not slip you something!
went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive.
there is no belt above black.
and I am telling 'ya, could be in maxim.
well rested.
get in here.
so... best to just lay off.
as brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
just drink a lot of water.
but a co-worker- dare i say, a friend?
I am right here.
here we go.
you are good.
hey.
it... leadership off-site.
you are not on <i>anything?</i> good.
you want to do this the hard way.
hello...  yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so... yup.

well, that was a waste of a text.
oh.
you heard me!
what?
space shuttle.
the time is getting very close!
sort of bat clean up and- that is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
actually, it was-no, it was when i heard her voice.
you can sleep up top.
sounds like fun.
come on!
was she talkin' back?
no.
phyllis, seriously?
alright?
so please hand this letter of congratulations to dwight k. schrute.
solamente en espanol, por favor.
ahh, that is mine.
like you and your son.
you enjoy the second act.
really?
attention, everyone.
all that paper burning up.
because i value your opinions.
i think i am going to use my complimentary blindfold.
you have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are going to concede.
we wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
here we go.
that looked like it was going to be good.
it is not really 1992 anymore.
say clump!
this trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three mississippi, maybe three and a quarter.
it is one of my dreams.
i could not do that, jim.
god!
let us go!
right?
unstoppability.
you got to do something- how much time do you think you will need?
thank you.
at all.
she can talk!
good.
do not throw it!
and i threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish.
oh.
yep.
that is my favorite!
that is not being a good boyfriend.
and I am optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
rrrr.
there is a chance.
what i am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
you can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
ok. so, let us dish.
surprise me.
does not matter.
this is it, check that out, can you smell that?
no, on second thought, low ball them.
he is my best customer.
but i have a destiny in this realm.
yes?
in nature, there is something called a food chain; it is where the shark eats a little shark.
what is the plan?
and you are a princess?
and guess what, kids.
where is he going to park?
what is the procedure, everyone?
hello jo.
dwight schrute.
I am not going for bulk, I am going for tone.
uh oh, let us see what happens...  inconclusive.
and i call over to kevin, "kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" and he looks at me and he says, "michael, yes it is a tweed jacket." and i look back at him and i say, "i feel the need!... the need for tweed." oh, thank you.
you do not deserve to have this branch.
he is been stuck working under josh, the poor man's michael scott, as he is known around my condo.
wait, canine aids?
he is going to see me.
and uh, faster metabolism.
all right, then the bureau chief for the greater wilkes-barre area?
let us send up accounting.
I am pretty busy, i should just... oh.
canada.
red cross, you know, racket.
yeah!
tell him dwight schrute wants to talk to him.
hey, pam, pam- with this raise there are strings attached.
okay.
okay, i just... it is a sales call.
it is not your fault.
okay.
of course i am.
i just, i need something kind of embarrassing, you know.
that was not so hard now was it?
careful.
you got a better way?
see what i did?
tell her what it is.
do not let him in!
i do not see the point of that.
yeah, i know i understand... we are making great strides and we are updating, but business as usual, no?
come on.
wait a minute, wait a minute.
phyllis is masturbating.
because i would actually like to bring them home and pack them.
well, you know what?
or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse?
scranton is the cool, fun branch.
this is a nice temperate florida morning.
when michael clump wants to remind you  that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.
well, i am just glad this is all over.
oh, my god.
horse boat!
it is time, thank you.
he is my nephew.
how long does it take to find a cell phone?
there are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.
let us do this.
oh.
hey, what are you guys doing in here?
but he probably would not come, too famous.
yeah, just comb it.
here is the story, champ.
please.
move to the exits!
please.
it is all right.
attention, everyone!
are you kidding me?
you should be thankful that you... i... sum it up darryl, sum it up.
whoa hey, why not?
i am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
what purpose did that serve?
congratulations.
right.
i have a job.
you do not.
i had no idea you played soccer.
little sugar rush.
you might be surprised to learn that I have only been to one other wedding.
no kidding.
we all will!
ahhhhhhhhh.
have a hand .
oh, you know what?
he says stanley uses his miracle whip without asking.
january i think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
stop it, january no, no, no, means please do not.
okay, show of hands.
that is great.
yes!
two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table.
ok, so you are saying that there is a different time or place?
were they in the missionary position?
what other ghost stories do you have for us?
where did you get your outfit?
um... okay, "meredith is so old..." if everybody... could do it?
i just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for angela and i. do not worry though, i have taken down their names, and i have docked them a personal day.
he is in love with a girl he works with who is engaged.
you are a liar.
okay, what is next?
so how are things going with andy?
did you say karen?
mm-hmm.
michael!
okay, every body.
i....
although david wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses.
pam, please clear my phone lines.
w-w-wait a minute.
yeah.
before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
okay...  oh, no, no, no, no!
no, no, no, no, no.
that is where you come in.
oh!
he is very very smart, and funny, and charming... you know, i can not do it, toby is the worst.
you are embarrassing yourself.
and this next award is going out to our own little pam beesley... ...i think we all know what award pam is going to be getting this year.
and not come through for you?
yeah, yeah!
that is exciting.
attention everyone!
look, i can breathe just fine.
i think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.
dwight schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard.
yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
do we save customer service?
it really does.
no.
this is going to turn your life around, ryan.
marching or garage?
it is a guy thing, pam.
that is great, ok. um, so did you get an email from me?
stop it.
he- he would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages.
yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
how many courses did we have tonight, two?
in return, they give me money.
what does that say to you about how i think of myself?
we get them.
just push and breathe.
i was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.
it is okay, I am a sheriff's deputy.
i owe you an apology.
damnit, phyllis.
it is a big deal.
which is not technically the same thing as the nazi party.
what are you doing?
yeah.
you are a real life wedding crasher and i must bounce you.
hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video.
pam told me.
what does that even mean?
hup!
then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let us face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet.
i mean, i can tell her it is part of the job!
shhh, pam.
so where you staying?
and besides, who does not tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them?
hey.
do not swallow it.
really?
because there is only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in ohio and not be charged with a crime.
right.
mifflin, spifflin.
because if they say no... no!
cancel this one.
it just sort of lost what die hard was.
okay, um, alright.
too busy knocking boots.
we need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
and i think i proved that today at the dojo.
i would make sure that you were dead.
give me the phone.
and I am telling you that i will never back down.
a joke always works.
yeah.
i do not even... what is the point of that?
not that they are not nice, or that have great personalities, they just... they just lack a certain... crawfordness.
ah.
fine.
we have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.
i say seventeen squares.
i will see you in ten.
and i am happy and i am rich and i never die.
ya'll come back now.
second, throat punch, absorb the blow.
do not!
can you send dwight in here?
because i keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
no mustard, no mustard.
hellooo?
wow!
i knew it the whole time, buddy!
i say yes, it is christmas, but right after they are back in the thick of it.
what is wrong with you?
she, she looked a lot like tina fey.
sometimes they come from neighboring...  we have one of the globetrotters, i am the skipper, and dwight, you will be gilligan.
come on!
it is insane!
yes!
why do not we watch that show that you have been wanting to watch, that stupid battleship galaxy.
five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one.
his cappa is detated from his head!
hang on.
there is no more reserved parking spots.
okay, I am a woman.
well, that depends on how old she is.
so there is that.
and like I am going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
that is the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
do not whine.
that is incredible!
there was a show called 'fundle bundle' and i was the star.
my warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
you always used to be very cautious... I would wear two condoms.
like, who do i call about that?
ahh, ok. thanks for the ride.
he is what is important, whatever his name is.
stanley, you know that is not true.
yes.
so double offensive.
that is easy.
do not you ever talk to me that way.
although the new car is a porsche.
go.
I have always heard that british columbia is a very nice place, but i am not getting that from this conversation.
that is a great idea jb.
look at that.
and we are through with it.
grab a teat with each hand.
I am sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
I have got it leveraged.
i want to see the baby.
because i want to play ball with my kids before i get too old.
we will be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
you and me.
like that, uh, dwarf from lord of the rings.
you did not have to... i do not even know what to say.
redact it!
yeah.
zip it, toby!
hello, dwight.
fat people are not monsters!
i just had the best, most romantic week of my life in sandals, jamaica.
surrender the tripack.
right.
i would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned french sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you would ever seen!
oh, god, that tickles.
oh, so... i almost forgot.
what?
good job.
no, but we should discuss that another time.
nice butt.
michael appears to be gay too.
oh, it is.
it was $3,000.
no.
seats have been assigned.
write this down.
damn it.
and i was sitting at this desk when i called you to tell you that i had herpes and that i was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you did not love me.
or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
so who gets paid more?
hmm.
cool.
who is that sportscaster that bit that lady?
i am not a security threat... and my middle name is 'kurt', not 'fart'.
everything's going to be fine.
so, uh, dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
no, I am not busy.
ready to do this?
okay, okay,  stand up.
oh, you know what.
you do not know.
what?
dwight." that is a total waste of your "m." yeah.
you said you did not know how to say it.
i think so.
fine.
party.
or we go against type with an eisenberg or a michael cera.
ah, so when did you set up shop?
yeah.
"oscar.
count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
ripe for the plucking.
um hmm.
yeah?
we did it!
yeah.
i have taken a unique part of who you are, and i have used that to memorize your name.
last time i checked, the american workday ends at five pm.
begging for her life.
not now dwight, please, it is not the time.
well, the branch is no longer finicially viable.
ah, ah, ah, ah... he is an organ donor.
you know who else was a freak?
i did not...  i did not think you needed them for this part.
think of it as part of your training.
i tell you i love my job.
but grotti acts like he is mafia though.
yes.
all right.
pam and karen.
you smell nice.
wow... i figured out your goal.
that is the best prank you have ever done.
winning the lottery.
promote me.
pam, can you come in here for a sec.
it is complicated with january  and i do not know where i stand, or what i want.
yes.
oh; angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
and i am back, in the form of a new company.
that is the problem.
I am going to go back to work.
look what the cat dragged in from stamford.
hey karen.
i do not care what jim says, that is not the real ben franklin.
all right.
jim?
neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor.
so fast.
you got to keep yourself dehydrated.
no!
yeah, small.

shhh.
oh, i know what you are thinking.
what is going on?
calves all the way.
but i just... just want to keep it within reason.
yes you can.
do you understand that jim is like a brother to me, and i would never do anything inappropriate?

hello, this is michael scott, regional manager.
empty mind.
iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches.
would i rather be feared or loved?
you get something good this year?
and make one tiny mistake, you are dead.
hmmm?
dwight, you are handsome.
i do not have a girlfriend.
all right, see you at one.
okay.
and do not call it a comeback.
andy, i will volunteer.
no!
oh, one more thing.
I will tell you what phyllis did wrong.
like a sulfur deposit under here?
do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
i need a soup spoon.
no... how skin is the largest organ of the body.
i think that yankee swap was a big hit!
see you in a minute.
ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can not be openly violent.
i thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
mis... mi... what are you doing?
no.
just, dwight, do it.
some companies still know how business is done."  okay?
we found something far better, their crown jewel.
guys!
in a good way.
today helped.
heh, okay, weirdo.
hey, thank you, creed.
pam will be eye candy.
I am going to make you an offer.
is there a belt above black?
stop it, please.
with all my heart.
one time i suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.
you work on commission, do not you?
that is, you know what?
just shut up!
soon, she does not know what is me, what is the image.
is that jim's?
how is tom, the homosexual sophomore?
these people need love and i am going to get it for them  who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?
i would say yes but you can not.
from this point forward, you will not use the bathroom.

nobody's after me, i just, i met a woman when i was giving blood and i thought she might come by.
it is okay.
come on start us out.
and it is r rated, it is not rated g. i am like eddie murphy in "raw," and they are trying to make me into eddie murphy in "daddy daycare." both great movies, but, still.
not.
the new boss does not find jim adorable!
well, uh, another option.
if I would brought in some burritos or some colored greens.
halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
i really like you.
who wants to give it a shot?
i shouted many things!
oh, so glad i could help.
have fun.
i should punch him in the nose for what he is making me do to her.
for goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office.
win/win is number four and number five is win/win/win.
i have already put down the deposit.
how is that my problem?
god!
michael.
hey, no no no no no no no no.
anyway, i lost him in a forest.
that is what this is all about.
oh.
do not be ridiculous.
great performance, very, very solid all the way around.
you do exactly as i say, no questions asked.
okay, okay.
ok, first, let us go over some parameters.
mm.
okay, now where were we before i bested oscar?
come on, here we go!
you were a shoe in."  well, got down there.
and it was not even his birthday, but i heard about it the next day in school.
look away.
limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan.
am i going on go?
okay.
it is a joke.
ahhh, why do not you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
yeah, baby, i am feelin' better.
alright, I am going to be in my office if anybody needs me.
the day he grows hair.
yes, it is.
okay, well, this will not do.
what?
wow, you were hired before i was.
it is about the workplace.
nice try.
does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
well we did talk about how handsome you are.
with ferocity!
you know what?
I am ok.  feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
of course i seesaw.
forward it like it is hot.
andy is never here today.
sorry, i do not have time for this right now.
it was packer!
my first order of business: make andrew bernard my number two.
yeah!
oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all.
yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
so you drove from near the courthouse, out to jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
push them back... wait...  no, it is this one, right here.
it is not actually the first time I have been embarrassed by a pond.
you are on.
she wants to get back together.
jack nicholas.
i am not a liar.
shh... yes, i know, i know.
... no, he did not!
gracias.
jim is my enemy.
oh, thank god.
and up comes the toolbar, that is what she said.
tell her I am busy.
second life is not a game.
yes?
oh, so this is what every day would be like if you had not left india.
you know, jan has my credit cards, and she is using them as if I am made of money, she thinks I am a human atm machine.
what?
ha ha, i knew it!
let us keep on track.
i thrive on this.
i know you are dying to say it, so just say it.
everything.
thank you.
... okay.
interesting take on dorothy.
doctoraEUR but the device will change that.
andy approved it.
yes, andy?
my stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.
this is our duty - to change their perception.
no no.
i do not know, what do you mean?
oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp?
you!
there are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
come on, i know, you have got so much on your plate.
it is intimidation mostly, it is the awareness that they are not me.
i think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
that just sounds weird.
my branch is absorbing the stamford branch.
mm-hm.
it was anonymous." "well, guess what,  that was michael scott."  "but it was anonymous, how do you know?" "because I am him." come here.
they were very disrespectful to me, and to the office.
if you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.
who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work?
just show off the twins a little bit.
actually-- no, bulgaria.
and i have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.
i am michael and i am part english, irish, german and scottish.
yeah, she is up front.
mmm.
that is the inside of your vagina!
let us not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.
apparently, in business school, they do not teach you how to operate a toaster oven.
I am just... it is a common question.
there!
not bad at all.
can not really trust my feelings anymore.
okay, where were we?
i bet.
dwight was the top salesman... i said 'was'.
no flowers for us.
he said, we have been sold.
when it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
how many in your party?
my last pay check?
wow us.
so how you feeling about the new company?
that is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
I will be six.
i suspect jim halpert."  "everyone has called me 'dwayne' all day.
right dwight, right dwight.
morning dwight.
what lab did these little clones escape from?
justifiably.
hello.
eiffel tower.
it is because of where we are.
conference room, pronto.
dwight, you have hit a new low here.
okay, sorry.
i give you toby flenderson.
supertramp?
i never said that.
it is showtime.
i know you did not intend to, but i just i got the idea and i, uh, i just do not it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something.
big weirdo creep.
i learned a lot about women today.
ready?
so long, clump-mate.
oh, god, darryl!
icing on the cake.
yes!
I am going to get you that rhubarb pie.
a letter from robert dunder.
your stupid friend zone.
just a second.
you are like a hundred.
i throat-rip.
i have already told him, but i will tell him again if you think that will help.
and another thing i did this summer, i hired my nephew.
okay.
haha.
it was a tough year.
these two people, they are living together, they are having lots of consentual sex- yes.
if you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison!
am i the only one?
i want to show you some stuff.
do you have a ride?
unless you and i decide we want to talk to jo, then we will give her a call.
unbelievable.
happy earth day, everyone.
things get ruthless!
oh, because there is a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
just what the doctor ordered.
very nice.
i was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
excuse me, everyone... sex!
i mean, what... was it toby?
why do not you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
can you tell him that we miss him?
so beautifully written.
no, dwight.
but not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
we had sex.
if you want to come through here... see we have the entire floor.
pleeeeease... let us just... ok, it is very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can.
because he would be intimidated and i, just... let us start again.
and he was also a hero.
who am i speaking to?
and how is it transmitted?
i know everything about film.
and that is who i thought he was.
now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
you are right, phyllis, but I have been there before.
everybody, let us just get over the whole meredith thing.
let us not be gloomy here man.
nothing left to do except dot the i's, the j's, and the umlauts.
yum!
for the performance review.
if you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink.
i have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger.
groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.
that is a realistic time line.
come along, afterthought.
he decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day.
that is a good firm handshake.
ok. uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
no!
do not screw the pooch.
i need your urine.
street fighter types.
that- michael.
wait, wait, wait.
"infuriating, irresponsible"... okay, I am going to need you to print it out.
it is complicated.
come on!
isabel,  nice to see you.
what?
no way!
well, he is just mean.
crisis averted.
if you are lying to me right now pam, your baby is going to come out a liar.
happy birthday, belatedly.
all right.
how many fingers am i holding up?
what are you doing?
this is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here?
michael scott.
on.
hank is our security guard- he will be ushering you out.
no.
kgb - what the hell was that?
i do not care!
wow.
no... that is... i do not... um... i can not hear your conversation.
yeah, it is just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
uh... because it is nature.
michael scott.
that... nobody panic.
dwight, jim is sitting next to me.
no!
you are lying.
but you do not have to go to class to be in class.
there is only one way that i would ever relent.
that kid does not put in some farm time, he is going to stay like that.
well i say that an empty desk means a... no, that is not... no, that is not what i was going to say.
very nice.
oh, really?
donna.
you have been granted level three security clearance.
she sent me an email this morning.
I have never framed a man before, have you?
do you want to die?
god, i envy them.
yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the mayor he just lost six votes.
go back to work!
he was the worst.
jump over the camera!
kelly.
that is weird.
so, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?
ok?
i will fix this.
okay.
above the sink.
oh, god!
okay, pam... she is not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
what do we got?
everyone here is extremely gruntled.
look out your left hand window and you will see vance refrigeration.
we are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
it is like the devil's cursive.
let me check.
tell them what you told me.
go back to the monkey!
two sailors walk into a bar... oh, why not?
i signed up for second life about a year ago.
i inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard.
yeah.
aw, you know what do not get no respect?
of-kay.
you know what?
and i would not tell the cops a thing.
and good luck.
ah, damn!
kevin.
okay, well, a pleasure.
i... what a great guy.
the eyes are the groin of the head.
message in a bottle, the postman... kevin costner.
I am startin' to feel it a little bit.
what about shoe la la?
and then you have to tame it.
why do you even need soap?
one of a kind.
today marks several important milestones.
oh, yeah.
stanley.
we had some laughs.
i recently purchased some insurance that i can not afford given my present salary.
such an hr weirdo.
talk like you are talking to that race.
I am sorry, am i interrupting?
pam was supposed to get  them.
well it is a little chillier than i had thought, so i have fashioned my hat back into my pants.
poopball?
he is going to kill the store?
got it?
"hey darryl, how is it hangin'?
they would not make it unless people liked it.
toby flenderson, come on up here.
okay.
dwight... listen to me close.
i am here to see you off.
as has phyllis.
alright!
she is totally flat.
give it a couple of years.
nice.
this is jim!
alright!
mr. handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes.
you are the love of my life.
let me feel that.
no, no, no.
it is not true.
you did not know that?
i am going to totally pimp this place out.
no?
oh, no big deal.
one thing about me, i am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
this is about a very cool hr initiative that if we do not follow, we are all going to die of obesity.
oh, yes.
no, no.
do i feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that i was invited to?
gives me a chance to sow my wild oats.
i use a bad apiarist.
i am sorry.
door.
what is dwight up to?
god, you look like such an idiot.
if there is anyone here who can finish it, it is you.
oooh, alright I will talk to her.
who is to say?
today is my b-day, and people around here just go crazy for it.
ah, ok. what is it?
and, yes, I have heard women and children first.
lost six pounds, too.
you do not have to point to the fact that we are thinking about it.
absolutely not.
do not know where it goes, but it is home to me and i walk alone.
three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps.
thank you.
oscar... okay, that is <i>not</i> an eight foot sub.
you know who the vandal is.
i can solve it.
cons: i do not really trust him.
lynn, follow me, come on in.
rich people love pizza.
okay, I am seeing some confused... faces out there.
maybe it is safe!
I am a schrute.
thank you.
and also, i would like to say that i will be canceling my trip down to tallahassee.
we have got smoke!
why is not it in my hand?
it was pretty mixed.
no!
very few do who have tried to be a star.
kevin.
well, i have been booked for three years, so you should have that.
this is a message to the entire office so they can see that i am capable of physically dominating them.
good?
thank you angela.
uh-huh.
stop it!
whoever drew this got it exactly right.
aw, so good to be home.
do you and pam ever get frisky?
yes!
corporate has given dwight two strikes.
no, it was mutual.
I have been here the whole time.
it is a heart.
alright.
somebody just walked in.
here ya go temp, take my jacket!  ]
michael is a man of great depth and passion.
i could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now.
i got this.
okay.
your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again.
oh, this could be a juicy one.
because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job.
do you accept my withdrawal?
i do not want to end up like sunny bobo.
do not let yourself down, andy.
i could talk about boobs.
can you hear us?
really?
have pam come down.
hey ryan, look.
you people should be ashamed of yourselves!
no, today at work.
it is like...  you know what I am talking about?
but it just may be a lunatic...  no.
what is up spinsters?
great.
ok. it did.
that usually works on him.
they wasted nothing.
good.
who here has done something stupid in their lives?
oh, yes, we do.
well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.
there is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.
phone holly.
okay.
they punk'd us good!
pull over at exit 40.  there is a liz claiborne outlet.
nothing but net.
what?
they took the pitcher out of the game.
we will see.
i need to let somebody go today.
let us get some shots.
well, that is what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
you are hired!
you can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
yeah!
well you get the picture.
that means do not.
it is called willy wonka and the chocolate factory.
i know.
they call it a porch, but it has a deck.
i am incommunicado, capisce?
they want how many spiral pads?
what is happening?
they do not get that high.
i just went out for a walk.
what?
good.
yes, exactly.
you know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
so i think i will just...drag it out.
nah, it is not.
lye!
so without further ado,   i would like to start saying my goodbyes  okay.
okay.
he is throwing it.
well, you could take the bus.
you know what?
why just michael?
kelly thank you.
oh i get it, i get it, come on, freeloader.
i came extra-early.
back to a convict.
it is a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet?
it is none of your business.
i mean, i do not... i do not sit on your lap because it is comfortable.
ok?
dwight schrute, dunder mifflin.
anybody?
i love you.
michael?
there you go.
it makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
oh, pam with a zinger.
you never yell at the client.
he is a valued member of this company... and you know what?
right there.
come in.
oscar?
i climb off, walk around the corner... ta-freakin'-da!
oh, my god.
friends only.
I have got penises on the brain.
wonder where my e-vitation is.
oh!
nope, nope, i do not think anybody wants to see that.
chillin'.
alright, let us bang this out.
watch this.
they always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way.
wow, kind of mean.
and i was just hoping you would give me your approval.
i just saw this baby daddy- why, darryl, because I am quote white quote unquote?
i can not prove it but i think she might be trying to poison me.
you know what?
but we need money coming in every week.
did anyone do anything involving an indian burial ground?
why on earth would we give you a raise?
come on.
oh, my god.
well, okay.
I am getting a call.
better get the bleep button ready for him.
ok.  oh, wait a second, wait a second, that is hers.
impulsivity and inattention to detail.
oh!
dwight schrute calling.
see what you leave me with here, jim?
that is fair.
i will go first.
it is like air to you people.
that is really nice of you to say.
i do not believe in coddling people.
that is over $200 a year.
how are we going to do this?
phyllis and angela and meredith are helpers.
okay.
they are delicious.
you need to go a little bit further.
stat means now!
and i did not want to see them fall victim to the system, so i made them a promise.
i did, it was stupid.
perfect.
for example, i have never slept with an employee.
twenty-six!
did you believe me?
and the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
you expect me to believe that you are starting a rebellion?
what part of shorn't do not you understand, kevin?
but sweet because david wallace thought i did a good job.
it looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation.
people will draw unfair conclusions about martin and or black people.
i cannot tell you how i plan to escape.
did not work out in the end.
he was not happy at all when i offered him this job and then i told him he did not get the job, so- i do not appreciate you telling me what to do.
and i spent so much time in scranton and i never sold any paper.
including me.
no, jim, no!
it went by too soon.
correct, i need someone i can trust.
just watch this.
raise your hands if you like to buy things.
okay.
go to him.
uh, duh.
garbage magnet, god!
cancel it!
i took care of that cat, the best way i knew how.
no, no, no.
i mean, it is your call.
no no no, no, new suit, please.
ryan, i believe in you.
I am not kidnapping him, I am keeping him until i get what i want.
because if I am not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.
hello!
it is a coupon for unparalleled customer service.
freaks!
joe mccarthy, richard nixon, studebaker, television, north korea, south korea, marilyn monroe, ryan started the fire!
uh, uh, hang that up right now.
dwight schrute.
have a good night.
no, we do not know that.
every great seminar has one.
this is real life.
wait!
warm up emotionally, all right?
t.m.i my friends.
hey dwight.
just say, "i want to squeeze them."  it is code.
well, i hope it was worth it, because I am going to take it apart in about five minutes.
of course.
i mean i love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women.
jimbo!
what separates humans from jungle beasts?
excuse me.
where are you off to?
let us go.
and then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock!
and i-- well that is ridiculous I am not going to make-- ah, so...  all right, levinson.
it was eleven years, okay?
very good, talk to you later.
you owe me one, remember?
great job.
stop!
eel fishing.
he...stopped going out at night.
so, open wide pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.
a what?
come on.
bo banley.
god.
when did the cast list go up?
well, you can not get diseases from a bird!
you should come back.
I am on medication.
dwight!
oh, shiii... ladies and gentleman, for the first time as a couple, mr. and mrs. bob vance.
cathy, write that down and print it out.
if i just went away right now, would that be the best gift that i could give you?
guys have been...  glasses, turban, ear hair, fatty 3, shorts, fatty 2, lozenge, and fatso.
i guess he is saying that he is proud of me.
aaaarrhh!
here is a door.
what is it?
attention, office.
i just want to know who did it so i can punish them.
ya done good kid, ya done good.
absolutely.
you do not know what it is.
oh well.
there is one that sounds like a jackhammer.
say hi to pam!
try again!
it is extraordinary.
what is wrong with you people?
just... i want you to think about it, I am starting my own company.
somebody help her.
that is an excellent question.
grief counseling is not about, "are you hungry?
guys, I am scared.
because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person i hung out with the most.
i burned my foot on a george foreman grill.
good.
we are so alike.
and do not sign your name to it.
but let us just say that jim was lying about jury duty.
the warmth will lure people inside.
i went -- i once went 28 years without having sex.
nerd.
yes, you can.
this does not feel as important though.
anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about.
oh man!
you are doing it.
pukey's good.
i would be number two right now at home depot!
no.
okay, fine.
ok, i have collected the rest of the ladies.
great!
you know, but she sort of keeps it real.
no!
i try not to think of it as lagging behind.
what was that?
i can not... i can not here what you are saying.
well, i think we all know what you are capable of meredith.
I am not james franco.
are you?
is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
ha.
probably get some negative feedback on my ebay profile.
michael?
see, i have your attention now, do not i?
because first it is all like kissy-kissy.
he drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the.. how much longer is this going to take?
we are going to get you help.
you use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay?
and sometimes i can be too invested in my job.
oh... she looks like an angel.
as long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what i say.
I am not saying that is what he said.
nobody owns a farm.
do not screw this up.
he says thank you.
pam.
and this is the opposite of shallow.
at the very least it is bisexual.
i do not think you froze.
gotcha!
really loud.
thank you.
he is right there.
mom.
yep.
and then another- oh, i do?!
um... wow.
okay, i will.
no.
public tv is bust.
you will find this hilarious.
can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with papa and tell him about all your christmas dreams, hmm?
my name is michael scarn.
i start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes.
hey, look!
society sucks.
just for a minute.
oh.
good.
i was just... after the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
you all right ryan?
you know what toby?
but if something else came up, i would definitely not go.
roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
blah.
you may be asking yourself, "what am i doing on a trampoline?"  well, i thought I would bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.
please.
that is a good idea.
why do not we just warm up first?
just had it.
join me please, will not you?
i hate disappointing just one person.
oh.
good.
that is what she said.
i would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
eleven pounds... thank you!
for... drum roll, please , the official merger day all-family welcome breakfast.
say it again.
hey there, jada.
if the soil starts to get acidic, you have probably gone too far.
good.
the hill's a trap.
wish i was.
I will tell you who.
ok?
gold medals.
blacks do crack!
no judge is going to believe that... okay people,  listen up, i have an announcement to make, fraud was committed... I am... i was making it.
you are dead, you are dead, you are dead.
come on.
stanley?
kicked off the force.
i need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
this is not dwight schrute!
and unless somebody taught mose sex, that baby is mine.
soccer ball and cleats.
god!
no, not harry potter.
oh, carol.
yes i did, yeah yeah.
he is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.
...ish.
let us do it.
you can go to hell.
and please refer to the map, stay off of the web.
thank you.
abso... you know what?
we search for the organs.
dwight, you got to move!
peace out, seacrest!
always have your back.
he is outta here!
you did not see it, pam.
you go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
ok. do you want me to repeat that?
when i came to you fine establishment.
ok, three or four with him .
is mr. schofield there?
stanley!
but sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.
this is not a cheap motel!
not yet.
yeah, but that does not matter, you could get a brain aneurysm- or get hit by a car- or a bus or a train.
ok, wait.
let me demonstrate.
dunder mifflin!
like all human beings?
let us go.
ah yeah, that is nice.
i had not noticed.
what if we can not do it quickly?
here.
wait.
did you hear anything from corporate?
a lot of women do!
it is okay, if you did.
i tried hopping, kevin, and i bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
no, no, no.
jonas.
you do not want to know.
i think you are underestimating pam.
it was crazy.
he is been growing that mustache for weeks.
and you slap like a girl.
yeah, you should see her naked.
ready?
you can not pass.
this is probably the icebreaker you need.
i thought you were mose.
i think we have done things a certain way here at dunder mifflin for quite some time, and - ok. i feel very strongly that you can not just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever.
of course, yes.
mmm.. roy?
wait, no?
this is celebrating christmas for all of the right reasons.
this is what we want.
this would be a huge coupe people.
I am very picky.
you having fun?
has michael checked in?
come on.
jeb, my brother.
oh.
forgive me for caring.
he said he would do the same for me.
umm, all of the children of the world.
wait, wait, wait, wait!
hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
<i>that</i> is beardy.
how did it go with stanley?
yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you are a jackass.
ok you are useless.
your client, dunmore high-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.
just now.
you know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
a "michael-idea" folder?
that is very true.
i hope that can be enough for you.
go go go go go go!
society does not care.
i say to you  and you will understand that it is a privilege to fight!
sounds great, i just think it is great.
okay.
six million dollars?
woohoo!
totally private.

your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay?
ransom note style.
no.
no it is not.
this interview is over.
it had to be done, it had to be done.
bye bye.
kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
pam?
this is jim!
oh!
and action... lights, camera, action.
all right, I will take them.
i want some man meat!
here...  okay!
stanley in the house, everybody.
hello phyllis.
going.
nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we are going to be doing separate checks.
that would have solved all my problems.
oh no, no, no, no.
yeah.
no, i am, it is all about the personality, jim.
dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
the trick is to make him think you are going to do something to him.
okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
get the hell out of here.
that golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that is where i cam up with that idea .
my horn can pierce the sky.
I am trying to confuse your sense of direction.
just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.
dwight.
it will blow over.
you do not compare.
that is the worst news.
good luck.
what is it?
it does not sound so great, does it?
you are not going.
january rachel thinks that i brought homemade potato salad and i just picked it up at the supermarket.
her face is okay, but- jesus!
i want you to grab it, i want you to get my guitar.
have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
iris, let me tell you.
you are not prying this out of my hands, but do not tempt me because I will give it to you!
we will haggle about money, and then i will back down, and then i will not talk to her until this whole cynthia thing has blown over.
beat it.
no, i think you are cutting in line.
i always think better when it is cooler.
oh.
get outa here, please.
how ya doing?
a bottle capper?!
you are talking to jim.
it is another thing, you bossing me around.
there is this woman i met a few weeks ago.
tonight.
oh.
clear out, stat!
come on, shooter!
I am not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse.
i am willy wonkaaaaa.
who is this worthless bag of bones?
i can not relax in the same corner where i work.
i just... i used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst.
whoa, whoa!
and then when you said that you might want to have kids and i was not so sure, who had the vasectomy reversed?
of course you are.
just say the word.
he forgot to mention the herpes.
it is the ladies' room.
do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh?
hey!
some sort of pendleton crap.
so say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers.
thanks, steve.
phyllis, you are not... phyllis, no.
what is love...  anyway?
hello!
in the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs.
its says here that it is a 300ft drop.
actually... i have a bunch of these, good ones, that i did not use.
no it is not.
this is going to be a very good year.
um, my cds.
you know what?
so what is the problem, pam?
the dundies are my baby, and they need to go on.
you call that a sales call?
I have added boxing - lunches and on weekends.
carol?
good!
it is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here.
trust me.
that you look like the world's tallest hobbit.
hey, i hired them!
aw, shucks, tell him I am not here.
no, no, no, no.
oh, ok. what is that, like, a video game?
just get the car ready.
honey!
yep.
you are so weak, you call yourself a man?
we are going to have two men's rooms.
is making people act weird.
who is seen that before?
do not be mad, it is a business trip.
nothing, other than once again, i am just thankful that i am a paper salesman.
i bet she had hairy armpits.
I would be happy to see jim as manager.
look at that.
yeah!
no!
okay.
good.
so we are leaving early.
ughh... blech.
now, let us get out of here.
here is what we do.
we would love to see little jada come by.
it is fast, it is efficient, gets you there on time.
and, she got him a cake, at the restaurant.
you know what i am talking about.
a hostess apple pie!
good thing it is not the discovery.
i guess what I am most concerned with is damage to company property.
well, no.
ha ha.
hm?
i want some of those pills.
wow.
no.
yeah, i understand.
yes.
please.
that is our theme.
wow, that is- thanks so much.
i hit a bear.
a knife, roll of duct tape, in case i need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel.
i mean, seriously.
and in that chaos, i soared.
that is why i created the 'integration celebration'.
my old boss ed truck has died.
is it stanley?
jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
I am not a millionaire.
it is close.
what is this strange yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?
who is got roy?
i will grab you here anyway.
should have had hindsight.
how long did it take you and pam to conceive?
that is what I am talking about!
i do not even want to tell you what it is made of until after you try it.
that is my drakkar noir.
oh, man.
it is... these are people's lives you are talking about.
for all your paper and printer needs.
it is great, you know.
okay, and remember-you are not gay.
well I am sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so i appreciate you meeting with us here today.
here we go.
oh!
good.
you make sure that packer does not sleep with nellie.
and i could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.
please do not do that.
i am the ace bee.
alert the media, and then you control the story.
see ya.
just let me do it!
"la la la la la la la la la la!" what does that mean?
it was insensitive and i am sorry.
come on.
say you are sorry times infinity... ...because there is no comeback for that.
well, i was just thinking that maybe i should keep a salami in my pocket... ...in order to feed the bears.
ok, darryl, ask me for a raise.
amazing.
jesus had a daughter, and she was the mona lisa.
3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in asia so the numbers just do not add up.
oh that i plagiarized i think.
jan got fired.
really?
we had a nurse, but she quit because she was "poisoned" by aunt shirley.
action.
oh do you?
ok. alright, alright.
jim.
that makes sense to you, right?
how did it go?
eye sore.
jan is at home.
well, yeah... it worked.
all right.
remember that?
is it by the sea of tranquility?
um, well, somebody did something in my office, and i now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
okay.
yes, yes.
different guy.
stupid load.
so, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology.
holly gave aj an ultimatum.
that was  us, right there.
this is you we are talking about.
it is yours.
so i guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have?
answer me.
i think jim halpert paid them to." "this morning, i found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and jim halpert tried to convince me i committed murder.
I am telling you... if you do not do this,  i do not stand a chance.
please.
what for?
and a lighthouse.
get over here.
no, no, no, no.
guys!
hey.
hey, that is a really nice plane.
oh, hey, everybody, i think that jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
ooh!
ryan, you lived in new york, what do you think?
what?
good.
okay... you two, in the conference room with me.
i really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions.
well done.
biggest of your life.
did i make a mistake?
nearby?
open up a newspaper.
but that is her peariagative.
obvious, but interesting.
aids is not funny.
but then dunder-mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there is little evidence of that.
he would still look good.
your face.
oh my god.
I will let you know.
unh.
good call.
forgiveness is next to godliness.
you wash dogs?
this is stanley hudson.
for 300 dollars to me!
I am going to need you to let the mailman go.
stop it stop it!
so anyway, she says, "that is the biggest penis i have ever seen." and i said, "i know.
well, it has certain connotations.
no!
over here, michael!
why are you?
you have done more then you can possibly know.
but i think it was worth it.
fine.
i just saved your life.
own the solution.
let us make a deal.
excuse me where do you think you are going?
dwight, no.
oh, no no no.
now, i do not know exactly who did it, but i have a list right here...  you should fire the following people.
i dunno, i think those it guys messed up.
you are fired!
it was classic.
not if we turn these dials  all the way down.
let us go to the hospital, shall we?
right.
got it?
I would have to rip open the walls.
right?
they have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free.
why?
and that is all we have.
come on, you are obviously single.
I am having a huge blowout tonight, room 308. hope you can come.
and you must be uh, from the washington post.
oh, oh, can i be the first mate?
hi.
oh my god.
let us celebrate diversity.
yeah.
he is explaining why we are here, what we are doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... then he is going to have andy repeat a bunch of stuff.
so... behold our bachelorette .
gentleman, i would like you to meet oscar.
oh my god, mom, i got to go.
look at all of you.
yes!
no need to thank me.
eat... where is stanley?
you got a good life.
we are really close.
come on, big guy.
and from me, prison mike, to you, i just want to thank you for listening to me.
am i worried that jim and david are having a meeting without me?
that was really good.
his father's name dwide schrude.
i would like your undivided attention, please.
you are so lucky!
ohhhhhh!
come on!
oh, no, that is a male model.
you are going to get your interview, okay?
and frankly, the stuff that we are into is not very condo-appropriate.
and i do not even care who wins.
no, i do not think so.
i do not know.
i found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
i want to be here when you fire her ass.
the word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation.
damn it, dwight!
ohh, i miss you.
you know what, i would not worry about angela.
hmm.
clean out your desk.
uh-huh.
well, jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
four?
the first person to shout "shotgun" when you are within the sight of the car gets the front seat.
you are are <i>not</i>, to see that boy, anymore.
i want you to listen to me, friend, and i want you to listen to me good.
you can not do that.
i saw wedding crashers accidentally.
okay.
could you just please wait till i go get it?
well, you let me run the company?
me too.
the goddess of destruction kali stopped by to celebrate diwali.
number three, and this is a fact.
and... I am... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment.
no, no!
that is the stupidest idea I have ever heard.
not the living in fear, that is new.
jim jim?
oh god, what am i touching?
oh, i do not know, james.
frosting.
off the hook!
what are your symptoms?
no.
on behalf of jim and i, merry christmas.
did i feel bad for killing him?
like those?
i do not need fresh  air, because i have the freshest air around, a.c. and i do not need wide open spaces.
it... no.
that sounds good.
yes, i love both of those so much.
i want you to help us work on some banter.
i said i hate the, the style.
and the third guy says "i gotcha both beat, I am a proctologist, so i drive a brown probe".
ok. hmm.
so we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
no, no no, no.
they are mocking you with wordplay.
saint bernard.
you are bad.
and... i want you... to... stop!
all right, just say "some toys" please.
jan thinks hunter is very talented.
you are welcome.
she can not find those little colored paper clips that i like so much.
tick- and drag jim out of his office!
yeah, i asked for pickles with my burger.
he is right.
there will be food.
now you may look around and see two groups here.
then it was an honor to have worked with you.
so-i know.
good luck to you.
well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you do not win it.
hey, have you seen jim?
he is not the worst.
there are not as many songs about him, but i attribute that more to rhyming difficulties.
all right, we will have a motivational dance contest!
satan.
am i right people?
do not take no for an answer.
you know who i really think should go?
you know what i mean?
what about you?
there is some wine.
so... and andy is gay.
they are unreadable.
where is oscar?
do not be shy.
yeah.
the other man.
mmmmmm.
do you <i>think</i>?
go ahead.
well, thank god they are not because we do not want to make zombies.
having trouble finding a vein?
so you have to get home to wash your sheets  because they are yellow and they are wet with your urine.
that is the word on the street anyway.
good for you.
making copies.
hey.
but there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that i now must teach them.
couple of chickens doing a goat, couple of pigs watching.
you know what erin you do have to.
i think sounds have a lot to do with that.
transfer!
it is, yes.
i do not know.
oh, my god.
we are having fun.
oh, i feel for you.
yes.
uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop.
you know what, toby?
well... we discussed the fact that I am cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
while i describe to you the excalibur package.
aww!
that is debatable.
no debate.
so let us just all laugh together and watch "lazy scranton".
nope.
no, dwight!
i have an old barn!
because you are mental, if you do not have a good time.
people, i know models!
there has to be a problem with him.
i can protect you from kelly.
you know what would have happened?
guys.
must be tough being here with all that going on.
no, that was inadvertent.
'the treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.' the prankster is getting pranked.
my emergency contact is todd packer.
that is why i always start with a gun, because you can not top it, you just can not.
i need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without ryan and pam knowing.
thank you.
fact: jim and i talk all the time.
you are on a roll.
I am just having a little exit interview.
well I have got one.
admit it.
is it a collection of numbers and sales reports?
next to me?
why do not you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I will tell them.
step lively!
i know just the man for the job.
all in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?
also I am going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
now is the time for action.
oh, god, this is pathetic!
i feel like i need that.
it was official business, so just... yeah, paper business.
and i thought, you know, maybe i deserve this.
well, I would hate to see it blow up in your face.
no, you idiot.
so, what is your poison?
i could have helped.
that is a good idea.
impressive office you have here.
i have no idea.
oh, wow!
okay-- what-- no wait, what are you doing?!
i got it.
thus the yellow color.
turn off the music.
here we go.
i do not know.
it is nitrogen!
i would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here.
no, you have been towed by now.
dwight, hey.
well you have to pick one or the other.
you can do it, just say it.
you earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you did not even know it.
i do not even know, I am a baby!
I am the bad guy.
use to have two cars, traded  them in, now we are down to one.
your bill, minus the ten percent dunder mifflin corporate discount.
well, think of it this way: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that i am applying to the office are the same ones that have made lady gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.
i am going to love it.
you can talk to me for as long as you want.
man i should have gotten some food.
umm... mema, i think you just need to chill out about this whole pam getting pregnant thing.
no... way!
is that too much to ask?
let us get him inside.
mmhmm, okay.
well... i guess we papered over that pretty nicely.
turn it on me.
no.
a great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.
you think they would help each other out like that at corporate?
a lot!
holly's coming from new hampshire.
you saw the movie, those of you who did.
my bad.
no rest for the sick.
in that box!
fine, i took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.
that is what ryan is like.
you kidding?
i made a mistake.
uh-oh.
star trek.
you do not have to display that.
question.
how do you make depression sexy?
because he was my boss.
i just hated it when that guy was in here.
her hand's on the net.
okay.
that is my stapler.
mmm... no.
that is  heresy, my friend!
ya-bome!
the boss is not funny.
hey, it is dwight here.
oh heyyy.
either he goes, or i go.
congressman could follow.
thanks for meeting me.
and we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.
you suck!
yeah!
I have said too much.
it is true.
what is going on, michael.
no.
i think it goes without saying.
I have been censored.
i see esther's back in town.
i can hear it in your voice.
erin, i want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables.
yeah that sounds good.
aw, that is so sweet of you!
stop public interrupting me.
i will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
he is not.
i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and i want to show you... there we go!
and boom!
oh, that is great.
we had a 15 year on our beet farm.
pam?
mr. james halpert!
wing.
much better.
live strong.
me on the other hand, i would be lost without this place.
pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
ohhhh!
how are the marks?
need anything?
yeah sure, jim could go see her.
just sit down!
oh my god.
was its heart beating, toby?
and until dwight comes up, if he ever does, i wanted to say a few words about excellence.
ah, jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the dundies.
i hope you are not recording this conversation.
but, it was integral to the story.
like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less.
since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
okay, everybody here?
and the verdict, it was toby.
and jim.
well, he needs a permanent number, right?
we are to respect him.
you are bailing on me.
jim is jealous of me?
i can not take you, i do not have my car and yours is all vomity.
what is this meeting about?
that snake!
stop!' we are going to make a 'do not mock' list.
you have plans.
not from the kitchen.
can i drive?
all right.
to meet.
well then everybody'll chip in, it will be fine.
and, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy.
granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.
you know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
make the party.
well, well, well.
jim, do not interfere.
they can not see my face.
wow.
kevin, go!
where is my cornbread?
she has a boyfriend.
one plant, one sandwhich.
devon, wait, please.
oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
okay.
everybody has to go to the bathroom.
i brought silly string, dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
i can not walk around wearing an empty holster.
wait.
you are right, i ruin everything.
I am going to miss you.
this is going to blow your mind.
hey jo.
so where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and i do not know.
woah.
that is right.
there you go.
and that is one suit phyllis cannot fit into.
i could have choked so many people by now.
no!
michael and i have a very special connection.
no, no, no.
fill me in.
hold that thought.
no.
well how do you think the fonz got so cool?
whoa!
in private?
nobody knows what their race is, so... i want you to really go for it, because this is real.
hardy har har.
because, i thought we had the same birthday.
well, happy birthday, jesus.
I am not getting dressed.
he really respected the manager.
no, we got to be deadly serious.
jim, could you please inform andy bernard that he is being shunned.
this is our warehouse.
remind you of anybody you know?
the temp.
woo!
okay, since this is the disputed poster.
jim.
that is not appropriate.
i hope he finds it.
no!
late every day this week.
no.
oh!
i do not know how they did it.
so everybody come on down.
important show.
i mean, you are here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
can i ask you a question?
which is, of course... yes, good abbreviating, jim.
i have been a loyal employee for a long time.
is packer here?
no do it, do it.
okay!
he is a math whiz.
it was an accident.
that i wrote especially for this occasion when i was up there among the flames.
it is a baby, see?
you do not need to repeat right now, when I am saying it.
excellent!
remember on lost when they met the others?
breeding?
there needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat.
i think it is very apparent.
tractor pulling.
so, all the numbers adding up?
jim, take new year's away from stanley.
wikipedia.
do not make him excitable.
I would like to be interviewed for the position.
not me.
it is a sophisticated take.
yes, and the reason i did not get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she is not really the kind of person you would think would be into valentine's day.
oh, that was classic.
i talked to her-holly.

I am not going to be okay.
did i ever tell you about the day that steve martin died?
i know when their birthdays are, i know what their favorite kind of cake is, i know what color streamers they like... yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.

hmm.
i worked in a warehouse.
do you understand?
why is it so hard for people like us?
esther ruger.
and things were getting hot and heavy.

you are welcome.
boom!
we are like one of those classic famous teams.
people turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my nana's investment club can help the michael scott paper company become a reality, then I am sure that is what she would have wanted.
sweetest guy on the force really.
the states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest.

that does not make you a genius.
no.
no!
plus, improves your reflexes  see, i would have caught that.
stop it!
all right, let us head out.
i am not to be truffled with.
that is the ability to know when something is about to happen.
y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to china, and that may be the true, but what they do not tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend.
no.
who, me?
...we do not want them back, because they are... stupid.
jim, right here, jim!
but david, listen to me carefully.

let me ask you this, if i were- pssh, kay.
moral.
i think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
i would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
oh wait, i am your leader.
you can keep that.

i only have influence?
well here we are... i would just like to... alright then everybody, I am outta here!
meeting confirmed.

total permeation.
are you kidding me?
listen listen listen listen listen listen.
temporary workspace.

wake up!
kid did all the work.
so do i sign?
god, that is hard.
but you know what, you have been engaged for three years and i know you have set a date.
pflut!
unfortunately, i have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with david wallace.
yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.
there are a million gorgeous guys in the scranton wilkes-barre area, and you choose the man who is the father of her child?
they have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong.
no, no.
it is up to you to choose which you want to be.
do not listen to jim.
it was pretty funny.
oh, i feel like I am going to vomit!
to get some ice cream for everybody.
okay.
god!

and I am really looking forward to working with you.
yeast infections.

oh, I am ok.  i just want you to know that i believe in you.
i am actually great with old women.
four.
well... i do not know if that is a good idea.
stop playing games with me, crawdad.
you got to milk them, or else they will moo like crazy.
above the sink.
you think i do not have anxiety?
i feel like a real puerto rican.
I am sick of the cocky walk, i am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, i am sick of your uppity attitude, jim... i think i am not going to give these to you.
pam, you failed art school.
it is going to be cool, sleek santa.
this is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
you have the right to remain silent.
i just think a tattoo should mean something, you know?
dvd burner!
and action.
this is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
right?
it is hairless.
but if frodo had not destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
this is spinning out of control, pam.
ahh, come on.
nowhere.
i am not going to rent the third bedroom.
mhmm!
we just picked the best one right?
no sitting devices, michael's rules.
hmm.. well, look, i am in an assigned parking place in front, so... alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.
i do not trust her.
woo hoo, shout out!
yeah.
i know you are innocent, but i can not look like I am treating you any differently.
you talking about hunting?
...or biologically.
you did not get the joke.
that was still about me.
i accept the outcome.
you infants, let us move.
that was a little touch and go at first but i think we saved it.
okay, do not be nervous, just picture her naked.
what?
no, for one thing, he is not gay.
the job was not mine to give.
it is happening!
pull it together, all right?
I am an assistant to the regional manager.
get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
oh!
hahaha!... well... okay.
I have played it once or twice with jeff.
not by a long shot!
you knew i liked her and you just sent her away.
see, this is good, we are learning and we are figuring some stuff out.
the family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
ok?
thank you.
perfect cover.
people got a... a big kick out of it.
do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
i know that.
daaah, let us just run away together.
you see, i used to run with a very tough crowd.
not that i would ever say something like that in public, and i never have, and i never will.
so creative.
and we need to do something about it.
oh god, i can not think, need more mullins.
and that is it.
ok... what... can i do, for you?
or should i say, corpse space.
no, these are gift bowls.
uh, if they do not bobble, what is the point?
or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer?
that is so juvenile!
i wished for jan to get over me.
get your foot behind the yellow line.
goodbye toby!
phillip will be joining us in the office today.
here we go.
oh, jim.
yeah.
dating should not be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why?
a company runs on efficiency of communication, right?
thank you.
good.
like anybody would want an oven mitt.
you hungry?
bravo, watson.
you have planted the beet seed.
here is how we find out.
same as gold or oil.
she is not the only one that is going to be eating it, right?
did you hear that, dwight?
how would i describe myself?
but the next day they feel great.
let us do that.
josh reminds me of a guy i went to high school with.
i will not sell.
these are our demands.
we have to have the same weight distribution.
oh man, not good.
they hooked me up with an attorney.
i do not have an in case.
not bad, huh?
oh, yes!
i love that!
you are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
the willy wonka golden ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea i have ever had.
thank you.
look at the ass.
the fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment.
everything that i pass by, things that i witness on the road.
maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
one of the warehouse guys.
oh, hi.
oh, okay.
yeah.
you are a secretary!
no... uh, also, because that is your alma mater.
you were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene.
yes.
that is.
sorry.
it may seem like a good idea, but it is not.
well, times have changed.
or do i go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots?
eeee.
wait, why do you need three suitcases?
i want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
i need your help.
I have been attacked!
are there any questions?
so I am not in trouble?
i usually have a radar for stuff like that.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
ugh!
yes!
they are all mine.
will you?
aaaahh!
it is a ram thing.
you are playing like a bunch of girls.
come on!
its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out.
and i am baaaack!
we need to sell her an elevator pass.
what is this?
i was there!
we are thinking.
i just wish that josh had made a more progressive choice.
ok, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.
yeah, the less i know, the better.
nitrous?
alright, michael scott paper company.
every last breath!
it is all yours.
of course i checked it.
we have company.
yes.
it is never whatever i want.
and i always say michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side.
do you see it?
well... hey, can we just focus?
that is all that matters!
come on everybody!
they spit.
I am sorry.
you have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.
I am good.
chairs wear out faster, it takes more freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive bms bust the rivets on my pipes.
get him out of here.
hey monkey.
I am not worried.
I am sorry.
where is my girl?
no, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
come here, come here, come here!
i hope nobody takes this baby, because this is great.
what is the deal with grapenuts?
on a website, it said at the crest of the labia.
we start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes.
i live in a fantasy world.
oh, i have gifts as well!
I am just saying be careful.
stop.
alright,  just do it.
she is- okay.
what can i say?
next slide.
because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we do not get downsized.
yeah?
the limo seats eight.
that is by far the best way to strengthen your core.
yes, you did.
no no, did, i heard you talking to oscar about that guy.
let us do it.
um.
i am like bette midler in for the boys.
easy no.
later, a hole was seen.
he would not give me a good discount.
cool, i just wanted to make sure you got it.
what i respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how antz was just a rip-off of a bug's life, he stayed true to his films.
no more brain damage!
what?

but you know what?
I have caught jim talking to himself several times today.
present these to the dean for credit.
i am.
oh hey, no catfights you two.
what do i look like to you, paul newman?
i have opened in this very office building dwight schrute's gym for muscles.
appalling.
my cousin mose, that is a master baiter.
good luck.
stanley, i got you some ganja.
really?
fine.
okay?
thank you.
they are doing fine.

may i help you?"  smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
she will not give it to me.
I am an early bird, and I am a night owl.
yes.
which I am looking forward to.
i think so.
i think pam wanted to say something.
okay.
i know.
heisman!
just using the scope.
i know.
ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention please.
i know.
it was nice to see devon again.
he slept one night in your car too?
you are losing you.
you just had our baby.

wait, shut up.
do not tell them we have free delivery!
big, mad props to gettysburg.
bathroom.
dwight.
good boy, getting big and strong.
silence.

packer does not speak with his child, meredith.
because we work together.
I am doing your job man.
mr. dwight schrute and i just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although i probably will never do it again, i had fun.
it is space garbage.
who saw that coming?
my colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
absolutely!
where did that come from?
okay, weirdo.
so this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see.
oh come on.
yuck.
a bazooka.
in-grown hair.
oh, just went to the bathroom.
the problem is that i am the boss and apparently i can not say anything.
and i realized that i could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.
what?
he does?
none of your business then.
this reservation seems to be under an m. scott.
how?
we did not have marriage.
but you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and i just can not wait to see how you handle it.
that would be fine.
i do not know how you do it.
my wish has come true, incidentally, because, you have met me, and you are happy.
ok. you know, our sales are fine.
that i cannot get out.
oh ho, oh, he is running.
uck... t.m.i.
yes, this is business.
I am hip and I am jive!
now that i do not have a room, can i stay with you?
i have to make some sales anyway.
here you go!
be careful what you wish for toby.
got to bring our... a game.
let us go.
shut it.
am i going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?
arr, dammit!
one home run and you are out.
the vice president had all the power.
jesus sort of ruined the party.
I am actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
aunt shirley, hello!
alright!
gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz.
nice.
okay, okay.
now that does not mean that jim is going to become a vampire.
michael, what is wrong?!
the certificate's a fake.
i think you knew exactly what you were doing.
well i will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
i think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.
impressive... some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
yeah.
staples, the big guys.
no, because we are the three amigos.
smart as a whip!
I am going to put you next to phyllis.
oh.
move it!
you, my friend, would be da belle of da ball.
uh, yeah.
fine.
you know you are playing point guard.
such a sweet guy.
where is that wine?
i think i blinked.
boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus.
or obama twins?
or me.
stop it!
oil can.
aEUR  nellie, wait.
ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
i do not know what this pervert likes.
he is on the phone.
dwight, I am the boss.
this way, this way, this way?
give me my keys.
i am cool.
stop spraying me!
terrible idea.
i know!
we are going to make everything all right.
it is firm.
and i make my own salad dressing.
screw you, halpert.
"look on the supply shelf." what?
look at how long it took for him to find out.
yes.
a lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids.
my grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
this is what i get.
seat saved infinity.
you are breaking up.
andy.
anything you guys want.
hi, i am dwight schrute, mr. scott's associate.
last sunday i had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
but it also would have been incredibly tragic.
andy?
it has been a lifetime's struggle .
you said butt.
we should really do something fun this week.
oh, well thank you very much for all of your help.
good.
hello, I am broken mountain.
am i shiny?
they really do that.
we shall see.
is that just so magical for you, little girl?
that is the most idiotic thing i have ever heard in my life!
this was jim's idea?
what are you doing?
i will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but i will never help him.
donna, wait, please.
it could be completely neutral.
huu, what do you think?
kelly!
I will be over there.
dwight schrute.
we have a relationship.
they were engaged, so...  okay, you know what, sir?
okay, fine.
that is how  the game's played.
no, it is not.
and that is why, i am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
because if you did i would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations.
i am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.
some tasks are not worth doing.
all right.
I am comin' atcha man.
corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about dunder mifflin infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it is uh, not too shabby.
I am the owner.
fine, let us go.
heh-woh you.
i want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me.
a little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up.
they should not televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
what are my options here?
set.
and those of you who do not, i forgive you.
so we are choosing... check out dental?
no.
I will have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred.
good job.
i heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh?
correction.
alright you know what?
oh, wow.
a blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.
thanks for asking.
aaagh, aaagh!
well you do not get it, because stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you are... you.
and the caption would read: in the dump.
and he shoots incredibly high.
it just- i could not help it.
ryan's about to attend the michael scott school of business.
pardon me.
yeah, do not do that.
that I am a robot?
because you are my friend and you are a woman... and women love gossip.
ahh, damn this chicken is good.
super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
daddy's here for you.
if we ask corporate for that then... could go either way.
... and... we had sex, too.
the whole thing's silly, is not it?
pam?
no more.
i share my birthday with eva longoria.
we got to find it before it eggs.
it starred an african-american and ethan hawke.
all right.
do the right thing here, michael.
i love music.
tell him that your supervisor is on the line.
year after year, i catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year i present this award to a guy instead of a girl.
all right?
you... oh!
I am sick of this place.
what is your problem?
for any reason, whatsoever.
i-yes.
oh... well... stop it!
yes.
i want a price reduction or i am a-walkin.
yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack.
pam has been with us for...  forever.
yeah I am fine.
eww.
transfer!
two weeks ago, i was in the worst relationship of my life.
ok, here we go.
angela schrute, my former accountant is now my wife.
oh no, i have a thing tonight.
angela?
our point.
i am not going back until i fulfill my resolution.
tired... want to take a rake... .
then i went back to the lake.
wow, that is great.
erin, look.
i... we are going to have to... you... you want something better.
what do you want?
three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt.
I am sorry.
see, have not lost my sense of humor.
because I am the manliest man in the office?
inventory is boring.
it is practical.
i do not know if i want to do this.
really?
you ever read this?
we will put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
we want -- ok, alright.
please get that off the floor.
you just stick it- it is not really your choice, is it?
oh, there is gill.
yes, it is.
crust first.
same thing.
what?
parkour!
come on in, the water's fine.
is that necessary?
you said you would do it!
yes, crap.
blue collar.
ok?
you staying with michael?
oh, party in the break room!
but what if I am hungry?
oh... okay.
he is scummy.
john wilkes booth.
ok, who is hungry  no, no, no.
I will stall him.
recyclops destroys!
how would you do that?
every year, it is just fun.
this is an emergency.
i want the house, january i want the picket fence.
oh, hey.
just one complaint.
a one-on-one lunch with erin?
what is, uh, what is your name?
i am going to give you a piece of paper.
we get the 45 points we are back in business.
we were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did i stutter," and i said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" it was joking, toby, alright?
and karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you do not already have one.
and such a genetically improbable one.
no.
ok, can you turn the girl off please?
none of your business.
hot?
but it would not be the worst thing in the world... if somebody... it is a big red trash compactor!
so, what have we learned?
we have fun.
it really is.
thank you, dwight.
except this.
is that pam?
let us see how she does.
scranton.
you know what.
listen, i know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here.
i am calling because i am going to have to fire your daughter holly because she is such a terrible employee.
give it to me.
oh, boy.
you do not have to answer me now.
and i knew that you would do that.
but fool me twice, strike three.
great.
oh, you know what else?
david, here it is.
I am kidding.
i totally understand.
i mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it is wrong.
h-i... ...r-p-e-e-s no, i am calling to see if you gave me herpes.
thank you michael.
she is your wife, you idiot.
yeah, at first, i was really disappointed, but I have got a great daily routine going right now.
why do not we... here you go.
if you are unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with hr.
I will find out tonight.
it just kind of goes round and round.
good luck.
I am sorry.
oh... my... god, that is why people are leaving.
i can not even say it.
now that is going on?
is that too much to ask?
oh boy.
do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
makes me rethink having skin at all.
keep them.
what do you think?
okay, calm down.
making s'mores?
in my office?
uh, the florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they were not picked and maybe you could just clarify?
okay, dwight, you can let go of her hand.
give me the ball!
thank you.
hey guys.
um, pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off.
no, no... run what?
oh, shoot.
oh, i bet you do.
well.
oooookay.
do not let it bother you.
oh, really?
they are mushrooms.
i want you to take a card.
what a pretty smile.
not michael, e.t.
pam?
you know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but i could let you rent it.
is it?
thank you pam.
well, what if i told you that i have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes?
i do not want to work, i just want to bang on this mug all day.
just run!
well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
michael?
oh please, do not be naive.
no.
that was jesus.
this brings back memories.
here they are.
pam left her ipod at her house.
no, it is in like ten minutes.
right.
well, i do not have a lot of choices.
no... no.
actually, i do own property.
wow.
because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you.
now to your right.
uh, i have a pajama party.
well, okay, i based it on what i felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this is not even about what ryan thinks.
I am going to skip forward to a relevant clue.
that was totally legitimate.
it makes me look like i hire babies.
what are we going to do?
nellie nutmeg, come back in here.
what was the deal with the guy jumping overboard?
not outside.
okay picture this: snowy ash drizzles from the sky.
this is way too important.
please.
it is good.
i knew it!
alcohol is a drag.
and i know in your day she would be considered a who are but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them.
this remedy has been passed down in my family for generations.
that is specifically why i chose a room close to the elevator.
right?
you interested?
one cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
oh, ok. there were a bunch of complaints about dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
ok?
well, it is, like, well, it is, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that is... exactly, thank you.
i could make... i could make a profit if i changed one of the ingredients to wishbone  but i will not do it.
gooood morning, vietnaaaam!
and this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.
what is up-dog?
holly has to go back to colorado.
a damp rag, perhaps.
and i am happy to say that you have passed.
yeah, I am glad you called.
now.
my job is to keep jan away from carol and vice versa.
having fun?
are you going?
this feels like you never left.
is there someone there?
and then ... and then suddenly she is not yo' ho no mo'.
so... okay... what?
because you laughed at me.
because gay marriage currently is not legal, under you.s. law.
I am going to make some calls, I am going to get us an office space, and I am going to show you why you joined this company.
pam, you gave me your word.
i think it is too small if anything.
his salary, that would depress them.
january.. you thought i had no more cards left to play.
you are welcome.
other than me.
ooh.
jim!
ok, use your imaginations.
ha ha, you got that right!
and they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse i would try a cheetah.
just hangin'.
hi.
and I am going to go get me a new york slice.
i will give you that.
good night.
i have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
well, toby, if by me you are inferring that i have b.of., then i would say that is a very poor choice of words.
what do you... what do you... oh, I am sorry.
well, jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
here is what i was thinking.
prison mike.
you know, how they say take a chill pill?
oh... god...  god!
know what is going to happen next?
packer.
teach her to offer stanley more money.
okay, and... okay.
dozens of online iq test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing is not tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight.
just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
no, i realize you normally reorder in november, but what I am suggesti... you did what?
I am not a master bee.
because if so, you are succeeding.
jim!
when i saw him, i would never be able to apologize to him.
here, pussy, pussy.
ha, ha, ha.
ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
i hope you are not busy doing something.
angela, your turn.
i really did.
i do not think yours will fit me.
i did, because i am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
ouch.
please?
we should invite them to the christmas party.
yes!
my name's michael.
and i will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you could not believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
and everyone, whatever hank decides, that is the decision.
i wish i had your confidence, i really do.
threat neutralized.
pam, would you stand up for a sec?
here we go.
I will make sure to write you a glowing reference.
that is crazy talk!
do not think about it.
oh, yes, i did.
and i feel like i need to go to nashua and get closure.
no, okay... I have had enough of you.
you think that is funny.
my bad.
but what if michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
it does not make any sense.
that is true, that is true.
rhythm and blues... okay, so look that over, make sure it is accurate.
we got the check, but we are just going to need a much, much bigger check.
this kind of money can corrupt people.
oh yeah, something happened, jim.
do you want that for little jessica?
have you ever seen him play tetris?
okay, david, i want to take you off speaker but... i do not know where I would put you.
he was my client for ten years!
they reminded me of kindergarten.
all right.
guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
my name is andy bernard.
after that it is going to be beach volleyball, trips to cape canaveral, and sea kayaking with gloria estefan.
i appreciate the feedback.
you have nine days to save everybody's money.
cruise control.
is this guy andy bernard.
i do not know.
solution:  angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
toby is the instruction card you throw away.
pam, what you do not understand is that at my level you just do not look in the want-ads for a job.
no... you are crazy.
i know.
and that was what today was supposed to be.
good night.
incredible news.
you are absolutely right.
what are you doing?
I am sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
there is a line and you went over it.
this is oscar martinez.
i pick up day laborers and tell them they will get paid at six p.m. at five forty five, a certain ins agent by the name of mose schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of harrisburg and tells them it is canada.
he told me where his kids go to school.
hello, january talk to you later, january salad.
not now, not ever.
okay, they are responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard.
do the monkey face!
yeah.
yup.
okay.
that was yoda.
you will love it.
alright, move it.
I will be your first customer!
hey, dwight.
i know.
ok, I will take it.
"a valuable artifact has come into my possession.
god!
and because you are gettin' old.
i think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the michael scott paper company i really enjoyed having lunch with pam and ryan everyday.
have her come out!
easy.
sales team, listen to me.
here we go.
do you love me or not?
here we go.
okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.
on our way!
ok.  why did you have to be so damn good?
hello, pam.
think with your head, pam.
just us good friends, and karen and andy.
is why.
because you are interested in going into sales?
okay.
no, red hair is my area.
no, but I am saying hypothetically if we were dating... well, roy is dead, and i ask you out.
frankly, I am not surprised.
i sing in the shower.
yes, thank you.
that is me.
rule six, see rule five." kill or be killed.
how ya doing?

knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
ok.  where we going?
right?
exactly.
it is showtime!
just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
hey, listen.
it is time to unveil the tree.
they are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, michael scott is freaking cool.
so joke's on you.
time for me to find out.
ok, hey, man, how is it going?
i ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than i have in my entire life.
seems like you already know where.
um, you get it.
and in order to be healthy, you have to eat, kelly.
the problem is the chicks.
let us table that.
looks like a classic seven-man job.
so I will just think of something else to say.
congratulations.
anyways, if i was mean in any way to you, i am sorry.
aaaaaaaa!
a good life.
those things are like ticking time bags.
beauty.
yes, he did.
no.
all right.
happy holidays.
i do not get to wear my ties.
come on.
how do you know this?
i want it to be a playboy mansion party.
if she is not engaged, in all honesty, i may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness.
rookie mistake.
there is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea.
perfectly balanced.
please tell me.
okay.
no.
you missed it!
evan, this is jim.
that my friend, is your victory.

cold front coming into the warehouse.
party planning committee, listen up.

sorry, go ahead.
and they have no arms or legs.

a cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or... no, no, obviously older.

but everything has a shelf-life.
this is your time.
here we are.
okay, here is a tough decision for you.
you know what?
pam, it is very complicated.
stop it.
they tow after about 45 minutes.
they did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so i am now going to fake fire him.

i have not told you about her.
all right.
it is time to go it is time to go.
hmm, well that is interesting darryl.
why do not you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.
all right, I am sorry.
but you are right.
i started by looking for a brownstone, like the huxtables had,  but instead i found this very, very, nice place in jamaica, queens, mon.
oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it you want to see a picture of me trapped under a tree?
i have not seen her since.
in a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they are done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
your proctologist.

i personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record.
yeah, you are right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?
you could work on the way here.
I have done that.

jim halpert is a menace.

leave the keys!
hurt petulant jesus.
i am.
but you just said 15. negotiation is an art.
g7745.
but it would have ultimately been a disappointment.
wha - what is this supposed to be?
yeah!
does he own a gun?
this is not your fight.
it should be me... up there.
alright!
you know that extra bedroom?
erin, did we win?
do not!
continue.
it makes you real stupid.
tell him I am mad at jim, because he is asking us to give money to pam.

flesh eating bacteria.
I will just have another dumatril.

i want to appear aggressive and imposing.
two queens on casino night.

what about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
feeling good.
what?
that is what she said.
sailors are on water.
you do not have to say it like that.
"office depot is an annoying store.
hey pam, all this stuff with kevin... um, it is pretty scary.
great.
let me tell you about men like him.
you all took a life here today.
you are kidding.
ok, seriously.
we still do not know who the murderer is.
okay, uh, well, one is taken.
but i do not see it that way.
mr. franklin, i would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
ugh!
here is my card.
that is... that is pungent.
i thought this is where you liked your privacy.
does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
I will take a burger over a gross philly cheese-steak any day.
you know what?
there are four kinds of business: tourism.
cool.
uh, well, i am.
roman noodles are good too.
ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.
I am mork from ork." well, I am bork from spork.

we have never met each other.

ok, this is unacceptable.
go tell her we are here.
and most of that was just birds in my condo complex.
i am not going to be proposed to in the break room.
see?
courage.
whoever is taking it is not only insane...  they are now off their meds.
i have a very important decision to make.
i would remember.

i think they were stolen.
soccer practice.
ah damn.
the, uh, business of team building and morale boosting.
looky-looky-looky.

you might be bullpen, we will see.
dave barry?
spit... okay, come on, let us go.
ryan and i are just having some fun!
oh, look everyone, we are all making observations!
i am hurt.
it is not "farm boy swill," i will show you.
yes.
what is going on in there?
i did not say it!
I will stay off the grid.
i did not find a perfect moment, because i think that today was just about just having today.
when they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that i had resorbed the other fetus.
whoo!!
you have been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
excuse me, excuse me.
oh!

I will bring them by.
na?
yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert.
it is a defective ax, my friend.
ha!
really?
okay, how is that?
i know what you would do with all that money.
sun beating down on the mayonnaise.
busted, halpert!
he is a great accountant.
alright.
i do my job well, so why do not you just leave me alone and let me do it.
no.
no, not at all.
but i do not, i disagree, i say... let us hear it for the boys.
what?
erin....the receptionist!
no no, yes there is.
ah!
god, when he needed help on earth, who did he hire?
all right, this is going to traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
it is the most dominant.
i must cover it with my jacket.
that was gross.
dwight, are you peeing?
...and now the black guy from the 'police academy' movies.
what did... i think I have got one for you.
excuse me.
yeah, that was a joke.
i understand.
a concierge is like the winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.
we-yeah, they are very-they are different.
i have an acute ability to read people.
it is grrrrrrape!
take it away guys.
blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
hit him, chicken.
where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and i just did not feel like a priority.
this is the thing, i am a world class moron.
do you see my hat?
your old condo closing papers.
surprised?
michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
really?
400 and one penny.
these are not my shoes.
because it is a big universe, and we are all just little, tiny specks of dust.
ah, dwight can i get you a drink?
i am done with this.
but you are the best.
ok.  that is not appropriate.
go get into ryan's costume and check out his notes.
uuuuh... well.
yeah.
i used to collect them!
how is everybody doing?
ok. you already said deal.
roll into the future with work bus.
and dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.
um, question: does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to... i did not mean me!
i realize that a lot of you have already heard that martin here has had some trouble with the law, but i just want to declare publicly that i... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who does not is an ignorant, dumb... person.
you, my friend, are going to have to be stanley hudson.
tell me what they are.
dwight.
because please stop, okay?
operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.
yeah, jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort.
pam.
you know what?
it is enormous, but it is got wheels.
we are going to be eating cake at our desks.
all we can do is sit and wait.
if you were getting fired, how would you want to be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
how about friday?
welcome.
howard, slash ryan, ryan howard is sitting in my office.
on it.
tick- that is a clock!
he would dance.
you know what that is?
pretty pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one.
no body go in there.
drugs destroy careers.
make sure you got that.
if you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
but someone committed a crime and i did not become a lackawanna county volunteer sheriff's deputy to make friends.
toby, can i really tell you anything?
i had um, one of those danishes.
and what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
ok. I am sorry.
i looked at wallace and i said "i quit!" and as i turned to leave i looked back and i said "you have no idea how high i can fly." why would i do that?
i understand.
that is not in the contract.
no.
sorry your party's so lame.
i had not noticed.
no.
ow, ow, aahch!
take two of these  and call me in the morning.
because look at this normal sized coffee cup.
i did not see any heart.
where does he live, guys?
I have got a better angle on pam.
oh my god!
and my wife is a runner and it shows.
did you do her?
we are famished!
so, i got this bucket from jim's garage and i filled it with everything disgusting.
is there somebody in the back?
but instead it is like godfather one!
nobody cares what you think.
feelin' hot, hot, hot!
i raised myself.
i just did.
so if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just do not hesitate to ask.
why?
hi, erin.
digging a grave for a horse.
i tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and i failed.
oh kay, mind is exploding.
unless he fails, and we have talked about that already.
i would greatly appreciate it.
go to broadway shows, eat hot dogs.
no thank you.
birthday lunch- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.
because you got a good life!
it is the european cut.
god!
you live by the courthouse.
mission accomplished.
yes!
i should leave.
early worm gets the worm.
good for him.
yes.
acting manager.
and nobody paid any attention.
i hate it.
hey david-  I am sorry.
i do want the credit without any of the blame.
this is dunder-mifflin paper company.
I am creative, ryan.
very good.
i put it in your office in order to surveil you.
jan!
I am going to do it.
are we ready?
it will be towed by a donkey.
...they found the castle, michael.
eight minutes!
really?
sell me this piece of paper.
wow!
there is no stanley tree.
aaaaaaaa!
there he is.
i do not expect everybody to understand.
laying a base.
nothing.
all right?
you think i followed you in there?
yeah, well, I am not paying for my own stuff, okay?
two car parking... ...wall-to-wall carpets... ...all fixtures included.
follow me, i will show you where all the slaves work.
do not move.
that is defacement of company property.
I am hungry.
let us do this!
the heart is bigger than the skin.
must be this cool to ride.
okay?
i have assembled what i believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today.
do not mock.
you know how?
you deserve it.
you are thinking of a chicken.
yeah.
jim, what are you doing?
this is the performance of your life!
I will talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
go!
she is really nice.
that is probably throwing you off a little bit.
monkey, this is possum.
that is it?
i love that.
time to begin the interview process!
i have a discount.
she got the kids right?
okay, yeah, like a character history.
dun-der.
hey.
and 'ere they dream when he is about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
got it.
i ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.
pussy.
i have a special assignment for you.
that, uh, you really pulled that one out.
well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
anything else?
first, i would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
hello, dwight schrute.
alright.
why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
they are desperate.
yeah, meredith.
now do you want to wear a trash bag, er... yeah, why is it so far away jim?
win/win.
thanks for the advice.
hey, hey, hey, hey!
you are... yeah.
and when I am promoted, you will be full fired.
ah damn pop-ups.
and i was four.
and if there was one thing i di... do not really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures.
plus, I would be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
there is supposed to be music and it is... i got it, i got it!
that waitress was the one.
what do you know about conflict resolution?
there you are.
let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...?
no, i will ex-squeeze you.
ryan has not made a sale yet, but more importantly, he has not made an ally yet.
it does, but still no.
it finally downloaded.
but this is not interim manager.
they almost bought from us.
apology rejected.
look me in the eye.
up.
yes.
no, stanley.
well, neither of you are chinese, so what... why do you care?
well have a seat, or come on in, or, i do not know, make yourself to home.
so... what is that?
jim taught me this really cool way to take it.
okay, I will talk.
very nice.
I am not going to bump.
pam, when I am sitting at this desk, I am a salesman.
a little cover-up on your adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite.
hey pam, did you see this?
let us go!
i know all that.
i do not care whether you hate it!
it will be a bonding experience.
just go along with it, ok?
looks like you have got a little nakiri knife action going there.
answer me this, though.
it is like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against aids, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
well they do not.
i mean, short of telling david wallace that he was gone for three months.
how are you?
i should know first.
talk me through an appendectomy.
i know, angela.
huh?
which one?
it is okay.
how there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but what the hell everybody!?
as it turns out you can not just check someone into rehab against their will.
ugh.
can not we all get along?
god, that is 3 things.
oh, that is gross.
no you can not.
he really is, but not for long.
hi.
stop it!
by the bushes?
bros before hos.
okay, good, a pact.
so it is kind of our coming out party.
I am going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.
there was no other guest the entire time i was here.
that is important.
gardner.
you called dunder mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
we are done.
no, neither am i. we both look good.
no-- we are all unstable.
i love working at dunder mifflin, a division of taliban enterprises.
your quarterlies look very good.
all right.
get out of here moron!
he is already paying for himself.
jim why do not you drive.
he used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid.
jan in yet?
if somebody does not tell me, I am going to start screaming.
michael... wait, i got it!
there is a wishing fountain at the mall.
jim has a very expressive face, do not you jim?
happy halloween, everyone!
good to see you.
let us go!
i think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
no.
my dream was in the right place.
that is called card stock.
did you even read the memo?
no, no, no.
hello, we have been expecting you, david wallace.
it is you favorite song.
oh, I am sorry, i thought you were , ok, i thought that was.
i remember you told me that you loved the willy wonka movie when you were growing up.
the music?
i just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.
ryan how are you today?
it is called island living.
i have it buried very deeply, and i do not want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
ok, good, let us talk about that, ok?
she is got a ton of great qualities.
ok?
well, we are going to recalling all of that paper.
hmmm?
you want to know why?
not now, temp.
bildenkinder.
because martin luther king is a hero of mine.
it, we both, i did not want it, we both did not want it to continue.
simple...  kids love candy bars.
that is not what you said earlier.
well i hope i make it.
thank you.
but i do not have any... five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five... good morning, michael.
look at the outside of this building.
but i, i still think it is worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
i mean, what, what specifically?
okay.
not me, him.
done.
samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.
apu from the simpsons.

coast guard?
i have a name, close your eyes.
thanks for coming.
welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome.

the hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
hmm.
aw, my car.
you need to be robin williams and m. night shyamalan.
go to new york, confront the cfo, show him he is making a mistake... save the branch.
um, good.

okay, he is dead.
there is a special guest that i would like to invite to say one last goodbye.
come on, come on, let us go.
you are- deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?
grandpa, where were you the day the the scranton strangler was caught?
i thought it was over the line.
i mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on.

or uh?
here, get down!
how do you mean?
scott.
yeah, i was thinking about doing some gambling myself.
like we are going to the science museum.
just wanted to talk to you about  jim halpert.
i am going to make you the buffest dude val kilmer has ever seen.
three- hello everyone!
yeah, i will.
the website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.
copy.
you just... you said it.
mm.
i guess that is why i thought he ran away in the first place.
pam, translate.
see you in a few months.
oh.

yes.
clinky, clinky-clink.
would you like your confirmation number?
here come the sharks.
you made this?
i will.
i can not stay mad at you.
jim, do not take this the wrong way.
if the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we would be done .
charles and i were waiting for you.
today i did something stupid.
i have a company car, but i still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high.
can you believe he would never heard that before he worked here?
really?
could you put these on the board?
no... no.
watch this.
i was talking to myself.
thank you dwight.
not the guy who was trying to be creative.
so you excited?
is your name jim halpert?
what are you doing in there?
like my need to be praised.
watch this.
uh huh.
break protocol!
uh, i better tell somebody.
if the people here were our founding fathers, the revolutionary war would have been delayed ten years, because stanley washington was napping, and phyllis hancock was still signing the declaration, and kevin jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
no.
I am stronger.
I would rather drive a classic transam than an xearth.
</i> i got problems billy.
do you think she would keep it quiet?
do you want to get robbed in a foreign country?
I will be right back.
not me, i...  "hello, I am michael.
do not wish them luck.
i have not even considered it.
they have a tcby booth.
okay... okay.
indian.
pam beesley ladies and gentlemen!
no touching.
let us just... play act.
what do i?
expenses.
the toast is really not supposed to be about anything.
i could not agree more.
I will talk to you tomorrow.
well, do not look, freak!
it was beautiful.
what did you do to it?
what is the meaning of this?
get in your car and drive down here.
eh.
check it out.
i am the count." nailed him.
mmmmmm, let us call it secret assistant <i>to</i> the regional manager.
guilty!
i know my rights!
bad advice from my number two.
no, kevin, come on.
ok, good, thank you.
um... what gives-what-what gives you the right?
come on, guys.
dwight, you are a kiss ass.
listen to me.
i love that song.

can i stay in your room tonight?
as part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing.
where is the line?
show us what you have learned today.
come on!
there is this great chris rock bit about how streets named after martin luther king tend to be more violent.
and this client is a woman.
i did?
respect.
does michael talk about <i>me</i> a lot?
he was almost 70.  circle of life.
that sounds good.
why do not you go with him?
come on.
hey!
oh, come on.
d'oh!
nohting.
no.
no, they are not transferrable just because i handed  them to you.
i did not know you played soccer, dwight.
ohh... ok, everybody out.
there are other choices, there is information that we - are you kidding me?
about what?
i did what i had to do.
you wanted to see me?
creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
okay, now nice cooldown.
i filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise.
he will be here in a sec.
so that just leaves dwight and jim.
you play soccer?
ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?
my blockbuster stock is down.
you do not know what you need.
go!
right.
but the schrute blood... it is amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing did not explode.
happy st. patrick's day.
i think it is because of my low cheekbones.
he was my accomplice.
enough is enough, I am - god, I am so mad!
well, you should have a little.
right.
f. alright, what is the damage?
I am going to need to put you on hold for a second.
oh, can you imagine?
right... what is wrong.
i claimed it.
just... boom.
i have invited barbara allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.
come on!
oh, it is a good day too.
go!
i uh... i actually do not know why i brought that because it is kind of priceless.
goldenface, this makes it personal.
all we do is work... is work.
react.
i think she just wants to hear my voice.
oh.
you see this on my desk?
have fun working.
you want to give back to society.
let us do this thing.
you are the stupid one.
I have made myself a nice pants tent shelter.
pam, could you come get me?!
oh, thank you.
come on in!
january look, okay, i think we are all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.

but before that, i have to do my presentation.
creed.
let me in.
want to, christian, blossom?
come here.
oh good.
just shut up.
i am here to scare you straiiight!!
please.
i was joking about that whole bund thing.
i can not do it again for a whole new guy.
that many?
why would i or anyone else think that you are hot right now?
and you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you do not nip this whole employee of the month situation in the bud.
I will see you later.
alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
not a problem.
but you know what?
please, thank you.
jump in the air.
okay.
no, i can not... i ca... blood alone moves the wheels of history!
moron, if he was there would not be a story.
what?
yes, i have decided to shun andy bernard for the next three years.
easier to stop if it turns on us.
anybody hear anything?
double ice cream.
so the baby could be anybody's.
you just said "part of your duties are to" something.
okay.
that was not meant for me.
stanley, i do not look at you as another race.
we are stuck.
if i can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
that should not be there.
well, mr. kurt russell, you are about to be served.
you get half now and half upon completion of said job.
no no no, let me see.
this is where you will have your receiving line.
you apologize right now.
pam?
please, pam.
okay.
after.
new guy!
let us do it.
chicken on goat.
okay, just close your eyes.
and do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you are famous?
you okay?
and then he will come back here and replace holly, so stop asking him questions.
you know why you have not made any sales?
or at least business associates who get along.
please be seated.
they are all good.
pam, I am headed out to another meeting.
thank you.
daddy is meryl streep.
prestige is ours.

ah.
do you think it is possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
so you decided to have an orgy and not invite me?
you and dwight were close.
but this was mutual.
you tell me.
do not mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox.
i do not know, holly mentioned that there were some complaints.
no, come on, dwight, i have to have 10 of these by lunch, i promised ryan.
i am so glad that i bought instead of rented.
it is a little bit bigger than i remember.
come on.
never mind.
we are wedged between the copier and the railing.

we destroy the evidence.
it is my job to be there for michael.
no.
i gave it to you in the car.
it was really sad.
I am going to forward it like it is hot.
two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.

but sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that are not dentist appointments.
kung-fu movies!

she needs her rest again.
i offered myself to angela and she turned me down.
everybody, dunder-mifflin scranton employees, brenda, i have some very, very urgent news i need to tell everybody right now.
no, trevor, i am not going to let you.
i thought... i was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
any one else?
because you are beautiful.
but she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
they say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake.

there is been a problem with some people sharing copier codes.
dun-der.
come on.
depressed?
people, listen up and listen good.
no, no, no, no, no, it is not me.
perfect.
they say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of america.
it hurts my heart.
it is called "schrute or consequences." you are going to choose one of these two things.
every waking moment of my life is sheer torture.
what have we learned?
please, just leave.
well you do not need two of you to do that.
i did fall on my sword once.
they are like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.
oh, and another fun thing.
stanley, do not walk out that door!
they are like women that way.
psych!
come on, get back to the slums.
yes.
how about this i throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' i lost my head when i fell in love with you.' it is easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school.
arrest that man!
hold on.
never, never talk specifics.
put it down!
i sensed that molly was not quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... hunter.
who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
i can think like michael.
oh yeah?
you still coming right?

I am sorry, could i have your attention, please.

by far, the least popular people here.
sometimes they are the nicest ones.
come on, think.
good.
what are you doing?
no, the baby does not ruin anything, kevin, ok?
at least, that is how the legend goes.
i did not want everybody to know what it was.
I am working on an english character.
it does not just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
dwight, no.
maybe you and charles should kick the soccer ball around.
care for it.
pam, pam!
hello son.
now see, that is not so hard, right?
yeah.
or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you have been... ever.
and, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
wh--  you sabotaged me.
ok, what is going on here?
no, i have to take it, or it will seem suspicious.
you are so brave.
and we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place.
it was right under his nose.
so... all right, well, you are going to have to deal with this yourself.
okay scram, wizard.
who is first?
which is exactly how you would want to sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
he is okay.
but seriously, if you break that girl's heart i will literally kill you and your entire family.
to prepare for lunch.
you are in the clear.
nothing wrong with this stuff.
no, no.
jan and astrid are leaving.
you find it?
I am sorry, just a sec.
yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market?

i want to see it.
let us go do it to somebody else.
what are you guys talking about?
yes, well.
and i think you owe me this.
erm, that is one of the 'big guys.' been on hold this whole time.
ok... ignore him.
you... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by...  and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well... one more time.
out.
there is no toilet paper here.
this is our receptionist, pam.
with us?
i prefer to stand.
what do you say, jan?
it is all, on the table.
are there any questions?
oh, cr..., oh, god.
no plowing my own acres.

you drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
okay, oh okay, okay.
oscar martinez, cheer or fear?
what is your name?
give me the phone.
okay.
no!
oh!
is it because I am white and chris is black?
that is pretty good.
that is it, the end.
i was in your heart... and next to your kids.
yes, i did.

there is no way you are laughing at this.
just let me--let me do this-- just wait and send it to voicemail.
an enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous schrute traditions.
with today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it is our government or the government of other countries a.k.a.

too much change is not a good thing.

you want to eat cat food with kevin and not go to the hospital?
with carol, i knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day i met her.
it is not.
why do you ask?
really really good.
the reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.
really?
then i would bring an axe, no books.
do i know what the surprise is?
okay, let us talk about this.
the company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
phyllis, look at-  okay, that is...  all right, all right.
you should not do things like that.
you two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
look at him, he is laughing.
this room is a pit.
hello, hello!
i do not even think there is booze on the boat.
right, yes, yeah.
i do not know you.
sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man dwight just to see what was shakin'.
and jan was really happy for me.
right there.
i will allow that.
if i were buying my coffin, i would get one with thicker walls so you could not hear the other dead people.
ok, i am just getting started, ok?
and frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now i find very alarming.
'scuse me.
shut up!
no thank you, i never let anyone walk behind me.
are you saying... normally, i find pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office.
it is ah... god, these people are so... these are good people.
do not you realize the key is inside you?
hi.
it is been a week, and i still can not believe it.
.
or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
oh, so that is how it is going to be.
come on, let us go back to the party.
why do not you take a picture.
I will have what she is having!
I am just a bee, dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'.
i will never give up.
jim is jealous of me.

gay.
in it, the african-american trains ethan hawke with various tests and trials.
hey, angela, rushy, rushy.
sorry you had to hear that.
yeah!
but the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
all right?
here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I am at it.
alright, well, cool.
your answer to everything is to get divorced.
yeah, totally single.
because I have got this book called the kama sutra.
you know what?
not real.

chillax, pam.
well, I am going to wait till the end of the day.
i am also considering stanley because of all the good that black people have done.
oh yea you did not say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect.
why did i say that?
your body only has a certain amount.
do not let him.
it is "nobody's perfect." nice stroke, pam.
and once I am finished, it is over.
oh, i forgot.
someone is returning!
as a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order.
who could it be?
look.
nothing.
yes.
i have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.
also, i did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
what difference does it make?
which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." i do not understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.
together we run a no-nonsense office.
and the sequel, "woman stands at desk and works." so, i have no idea how you,  how you sit like that.
they need to be all business.
you did?
a ten inch black and white?
i was once an enormous monster baby.
because people out there are expecting it.
seasonal effective disorder, aka: sad.
I am doing it... with carol!
you see, I am applying!
any kind of meat that you can possibly name!

in the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
uh, better ask jim.
this is a fine precision instrument.
oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
no!
i mean, he knows exactly how you are feeling.
um, i am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice.
you know, i had a great crop yield this fall... i went to the store and i pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away.
i do not know.
but i will never let him lose his dignity.
okay.
where things are.
do not drop the soap!
no, you can not get flowers for someone who is in a coma.
airplane.
wow, you are huge!
it is a tightrope for babies.
ratting somebody out.

i walked right into that.
phyllis?
i buy my suits the old fashioned way.
admit it.
boom!
may i borrow someone is textbook, please?
oh my god, oh god!
and now packer wants to come home.
if someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
if that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
oh!
safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and...  getting everyone home on time.
aww, darryl.
it is a trash can.
i know.
you should try it sometime.
yes.
stand by your man.
hello, am i the 107th caller?

them in there all together.
oh nope!
no, nothing happened.

one million dollar!
they told me.
are you clicking a detonator?
i do not understand why michael is wasting his time with spanish.
yeah!
well, ok, it says here that i learned something and i knew all this stuff already, so... i know, i could sign something that says that i taught something, or that i helped you teach something, so... pam!
what?
you know what?
well, this is slightly embarrassing.
toby, come on.
give me the phone.
wait, what?
you have not buried her yet?
every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at christmas.

why?
thanks so much.
okay.

big surprise ending.
wow, okay.
i do not try and be anything that I am not.
you showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.

the more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we are all going to make.
do not get bit.
oh.
alone but together.
what is this about?
hell, yeah.
how late do we have to work tonight?
go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!

i need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
right?
I am on it.
yeah!
i need to pee.
your mexican-ness is what defines you to me.
sorry.
rachel.
but i figured I would rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.
some of these kernels have crowned.
very nice.
go, go, go!
oh!
welcome.
nice steaming cup of'joe.
mate.
the seabring's cool.
thanks for your time.

but someday i think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids... all right.
and our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...kevin.
joy.
can you tell us about the battle of schrute farms?
stop!
go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.

well you know what?
okay, everybody who thinks that meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.
death to toby!
holly.
right.
no.
he put me in charge of the office.
i did not say anything what do you think i am saying to you?!
yeah, that is right.
they have to do it voluntarily.
mmm... okay.

oh, that is okay, she can keep those.
it was awesome.
come on, shake it up.
hr pufnstuf.
and i want you to burn this into your brains.

why did not i get it?
de-fense!
no, you are not going to quit today.
no, no, no, no.
the nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen.
oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?
please, I will make you proud.
baaah!
far too many died.
fake tree.
catch you guys on the flippity flop.
these tables tarted up like victorian whores!
okay.
pam made me put a banana in my holster.
but this is an emergency because my friend is not here and i am worried that he has been abducted.
that is real professional thanks.
little pick me up?
no, it is not insane, oscar.
yeah.
this is not me.
good.
oh, ok. yeah, me too.
really?
cool.
you know who my favorite character is?
oh my god, oh my god.
um, and the other bouncers caught up with me and really did a number on me... it was in the paper...  but to answer your question, yeah, I am really excited about this weekend.
happy secretary's day.
no.
angela!
walking through fire!
exactly, yes.
and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon?
oh, by the way.
oh, it is.
where are you?
here we go.
question: on the internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight- i was wondering- why?
hold down the fort, i have to do something.
belsnickel cares not about this-off with you!
english?
I am going to... you take care of that.
attention.
all right, here is what I am going to do.
we do not have a north pole branch.
i have yet another sales order for you to sign.
let us get to them later.
okay.
solid fellow.
ok. alright.
here is an attaboy for ya!
go slash his tires!
fair enough.
here is your duct tape.
yeah?
everyone, follow me to the shelter.
i told you it would not break.
i learned a while back that if i do not text 911 people will not return my calls.
i thrive on it.
for you, consider it cow-meat.
a couple of years ago, i went to one in hartford.
i would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.
may i have your attention, please?
sorry to interrupt.
he is a man.
technically, we fell asleep in the same bed.
what i do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
I am so sorry I am late.
I am going to smother that baby.
thank you.
by yourself?
no, no, no, no, not that-- just... come on, you guys, let us do it!
those are the facts.
but you are the best salesman, on the inside.
what?
you do not go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.
you read my mind.
I would tell you, but then I would have to kill you.
now, give my regards to hell.
hi.
if you want.
will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they will understand?
i need you to get me the prices that you are charging ed's tires so i can undercut dunder mifflin.
so what is the deal?
um.
she was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
the electric city.
make a decision.
okay.
okay, danny...this is not pennsylvania solartech.
as has kelly.
dwight is my friend.
pillow talk.
do you have plans tonight?
what is wrong with <i>you</i>?
to be burned!
how i screamed.
pflut!
no.
nothing.
I am sure.
it is time for the great spoon and egg race.
bye now.
I am all right.
I am like mr. miyagi and yoda rolled into one.
osama bin laden.
because of all the good work you have done.
what the hell?
start the party.
in an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain.
this is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.
i have some bad news.
let us go.
oh please!
check that out.
when people work together, there is going to be conflict.
that is possible.
that is not true.
well, it is...  no, do not cry, it is going to be ok. i do not know.
oh, i am in my office.
come and get it!
we need to find a place where you feel comfortable.
i am unreachable.
it would be my pleasure, mr. schrute.
as a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
yeah, i tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected... oh... oh, umm... yes.
it hurts my arms.
it is spppplllibbb no, here is the thing.
no, michael, stop it!
that was the sick one, right?
i might.
bring something to write with and something to write on.
why is she marrying andy?
kevin is wearing a jacket that I have never seen before.
thank you very much.
no... no... yeah.
stanley, we are havin a little... we are havin a little brainstorm session... ...good, this is good.
abso-fruit-ly.
you would have done the same.
oh, oh, oh!
we are not the terrorists.
ooh.
wow, terminator, terminator.
pass.
ok, what else?
flippity flip!
alright, bye.
really?
how long before?
hoo-ooh!
all right, listen up.
let us remember those procedures.
na... no.
sign please.
let us gangbang this thing and go home.
hey.
stat.
pam, I am over here!
i can not tell you how much leftover guacamole i have ended up eating over the years.
nice to see you.
you are with big brother?
i will give you a hint.
god!
who is?
i did not do it.
who is that monkey?
what does it say under martial arts training?
uh huh... great what is the pink?
it was terrible.
or the other sandals, jamaica.
you do not, uh, you do not have to do that.
come on!
mm.
awesome!
bad idea.
just remember folks, it is not about winning, it is about finishing.
irrelevant.
you have got it, you have got it.
I will be right back.
oh the rotating um, steam wand.
are you kidding me?
and you have been an outdoor cat.
holly... lujah!
oh, really?
store only has three employees.
all day long.
so you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?
all that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
the men's room was disgusting.
I am sorry, but we do not have quitters on this team!
ippi would take you to here.
you stop.
and I have decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
not good enough.
jimbo.
boo!
what does this mean?
really?
i got it.
where are they?
you went over my head to wallace!
i never abused my power.
stop and shop.
how is traffic?
i do not buy it.
no, we can not do that.
where are we going?
no.
this meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted.
so.
kelly?
because an office can not function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
what are you doing?
i was not attempting to compliment you.
good.
I am going to smack you in the head with a hammer.
you have been my most trusted ally.
women's urinals... uh... yes, it is michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
the other day, in the parking lot, i actually found a condom.
get out.
total deaths belongs to gettysburg but when you are talking about d.p.a., that is deaths per acre... ...nothing beats the battle of schrute farms.
angela, what about you?
do you think they should have had open auditions for the band hanson?
you know what?
here we go!
yeah, that is right.
let us go, come on.
pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned!
I have already got the run and the bike thing down.
i would like to talk to you all about life preservers.
getting defensive?
when i was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... i worked side-by-side with a fellow named todd packer, and together we rocked the office .
okay.
to be safe i should learn everything about everything but i do not have time.
alright, I am going to, uhh, get a cup of coffee.
there is this one hanging part in particular, that is some sort of flap.
no, no.
"michael, i have a secret.
they were the most fun.
kenny g. is... if you knew jazz, you would know who i mean.
it is not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you.
then it is no longer a mistake... gabe.
mmm.
baby carriage.
and i, yours.
i wish the windows were not tinted so people could see us in here.
like you would ever be cold, kevin.
do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
gabe, just go and have fun with erin.
no, i mean afghanistanis with aids.
he hires people and inspires people.
that is adorable.
no.
half of  them, we were on the same team.
reduced him to a mere ant.
I am not giving that to you.
emphasis on the bed.
'a luh-whooooo a za her'.
you will be back.
cocoa.
teamwork!
wait.
if i guess, will you tell me?
uh... .
right?
jim, get him a water.
good because this batch was awful.
nooooooooo!
well... that is... what, a computer camera, right?
no.
alright?
because of the downsizing.
i wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you are considering him.
scram.
I have almost had my nose broken a dozen times.
stay  calm!
uh, excuse me.
hypocrite!
god.
I will get the pizza!
david, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
how are you?
hey, congrats on the bonus.
we need another one, immediately.
if you ask me, he caused the panic.
meredith was hit by a car.
got a little client meeting at shanny of'gannigan's tonight.
damn it!
andy, andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad.
can i listen to my music at a low volume?
excuse me for a second.
oh, no, no, no.
i- i just want to say that i cannot believe that i walked into a koi pond.
just... all over.
the activities commence in four seconds!
take me home, to the place i belong, ba bah dah duh cherry pie, warrant.
yeah.
what is this?
i do not get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids.
gotcha!
i think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
andy.
you call your mom meredith?
a place for hay.
its simple, david would use that information to destroy them.
let me bring up one word: dedication.
yes!
i just say it.
i just want to say for the record, i did not kill anyone.
no, michael!
it works.
my trouser hives are void of honey.
to answer your question about jan, no.
ok, everyone.
so did you hear the news?
no you did not.
no, no, no, no, let us not talk about that.
do that.
they are good food, good meals, good lunch.
we did it!
call a client right now.
the girl in the video we are watching that corporate gave us... darryl banged her!
i wonder if anybody else would like to do this.
stop it!
yes, and if it is a boy they will call it sylvio.
you are all right though, right?
do not look down.
hey hey hey hey.
yes.
no, that is not how it works.
who is there?
one of the new people, please?
do not you think i know that?
this is weird.
when i wanted to see stomp, and you wanted to see wicked, what did we see?
was that u2?
it would... be fine.
do not tell anyone.
it was always burning since the world's been turning!
alright, okay.
let us go.
i would give that lecture a solid b+.
yes.
you know what, I am just being fair.
sir, you are awesome!
I am going to kill myself!
did you get all that?
i have left dunder-mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market.
watching?
and the same thing goes for quarterly reports.
he got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from.
okay.
all right, those might be his.
there they are!
hey toby, great to have you back, man.
okay.
oh, that is them!
he is the tax man.
hey, hey, everybody, ice-cream sandwiches!
here we go.
what?
god!
lists are good.
hi.
i got turned around.
totally your call babe.
oh okay.
why is it so hard to meet people?
have not had a hug all day.
powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world.
oh, you people are useless.
say your prayers.
and we will always be friends.
here it is, heart of new york city, times square.
ok, let us go have some fun.
I am telling you, all i will need are my instincts and my will to survive.
oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.
per mile, yes.
ok, probably going to go late tonight.
that makes a lot more sense.
that one makes me think... of death.
please knock.
who?
so... right.
clearly, i have had a very serious accident, but i will recover, god willing.
"i state my regret." i could not, because i do not feel it.
i was right.
there is no book.
aha!
but more than that, i realized that... i could not take a job that would take me away from this place.
man!
fudge it up!
yeah hope - grows.
because, that is the way these things are done.
to quote from the princess bride "mawige... the most important part of a speech is the opening line.
toaster oven 101?
yes we will see oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities!
i present to you...the alamo!
yeah, yeah!
yes.
and i turned it down.
she is pam's best friend.
hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left .
ok, now.
and i will never do that again.
it is right here on the desk, yeah.
they do not have cookies like the girl scouts.
do not even think about that okay, dwight.
blind guy.
right.
but michael thought that samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
well, we had the scranton white pages.
she... no, I am not talking about paper.
fire guy.
i always work out without my clothes.
yeah, that is right.
what about madonna?
okay?
you know what?
mr. bill.
enabler!
uh... yes, yes.
help me out here.
please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence.
who?
so i guess some good came out of firing devon after all.
no, do not call me a hero.
it does not have to just be the idiots.
yeah.
i will not sell.
was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
how many is that per hour?
I am the lion.
not on my watch.
I am afraid that ship has sailed.
why is she trying to take stanley from us?
he is just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
come on, step it up.
want to start unloading the truck?
shortbread?
fine.
you are acting inappropriate.
the world's tiniest bluetooth?
and you think that would be sexy?
i think one of the greatest things about modern america is the computerization of medical records.
but you married my worst enemy.
I will introduce you to the crack hr rep that you requested.
seventy-two hours.
no more conflict.
no.
sex.
bye-bye.
i wash my hands of this.
i think I am going to run out of gas.
i could murder him.
shh.
there he is.
my word against yours.
do not you!
yes, i am.
come on it.
i can travel anywhere except cuba.
thank you dateline!
oh my god, something is happening.
god.
no... she is in a coma.
yes, but these are employees, sir.
get them out of here!
thank you!
and today, that dream was shattered.
you guys would love it.
she is old enough to be your mom for one thing.
i will pay you whatever it takes.
what are you blabbering about?
you know what.
man, he is late.
um... find out if there is a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
come here.
why would you say that?
so what is going on?
no, um, well i was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?
one, two, three... too many to count.
stanley?
to a happy...  look at those!
everyday, for eight years, i have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.
yeah!
okay, what is this big organizational system that... that would be suicide.
if you are ryan's parents or pam's parents or my parents, you do.
this is my gym, my rules.
and i do not care if i take a bullet.
oh!
just, i want you to just forget about him, ok?
cool.
damnit kelly!
seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
nope.
arrr, dooby dooby do.
i better lock her down fast.' and the jennifer weiner collection.
i can do it good.
here is my debit card, i want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
no.
so, what is the solution?
if you guys stay, i will stop watering down the soap.
i do not want any special treatment, pam.
unless we are unplugged.
mmhmm.
just.
never follow, always lead.
allow me to give you a hand.
i am.
i can not stop this investigation.
jan says anything that does not scare us is not worth doing.
word.
that is just the first thing... came... in head.
it is a woman thing.
this, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
foul!
hey!
you are a very handsome man, get in the car.
you did not know it was my birthday.
life is short.
"m" your name is mark.
gool.
look at that.
egg on my face.
which makes absolutely no sense.
good worker, though.
okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please.
you have to tell me.
normal.
shut up!
yeah, saving you from animal planet jack over there.
assistant regional manager.
it will be good.
that is bad.
good to see you.
slavery versus the holocaust.
very good.
I am fine.
use it in good health.
so why is this on your resume?
uh, yes.
this is what a true survivor man does.
i do.
I am really sorry... about what i said before.
stanley, are you having an affair?
get set in your haunches, it is like your catching a medicine-- okay.
craiggers.
you want to eat, do not you?
mmm-hmm.
you forged the forms!
i promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.
he is slow, you know, in his brain.
i mean, i have not done anything since christmas.
i have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.
you can get up.
what?
come on.
i can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect.
ok, no.
roasted.
it is warm feelings.
michael, it is time.
there is not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
she is dead?
i need help right now.
hello, this is dwight schrute.
perp grabbed the victim.
nyah ah!
the bouncer chases us out to packer's vette, jump in the vette, he <i>peels out</i>, and i  i do not make it to the car.
all right, bye.
who else here is single?
text me later.
it is a disgusting sandwich.
what is happening?
alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
you know it.
why would anybody find that offensive?
if i had been jfk, i would have seen all three gunmen.
no.
i owe you one dwight.
there she is - jan levinson.
he hated himself.
i did not say anything when phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony.
we are going to listen in on darryl's presentation to the warehouse.
no, you do not eat it.
unless you want me to.
any of them?
new york real estate.
I am going to read it.
it is goldenface.
then, mr. driver, we are off like a herd of turtles!
no, no.
you are not bad, either.
ah, I am trying not to touch you.
no.
whoa!
see all these?
people, human lives, however, can... okay, let us go.
no, no, no!
where you at?
he is got to stand up to this mafia guy.
of course, if you beat us, you are fired.
and i have to say your leadership... has brought... uh, try double that.
i thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
okay.
we do not need a new copier.
yes!
how... how did he take it?
alright, let us all go home.
deceit does not come easy to me.
at all!
all right, get out.
retaliation.
and you might want to develop a couple of characters.
a horse is a bike that peddles itself.
exactly.
and there is stanley.
pam!
she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move.
okay, we will talk to michael directly.
you are worried about the party?
i guess we all kind of consider her a mom around the office.
we form an allegiance- -to use sudden violence.
that is a foul.
it is good.
people are really diving into their characters.
after you almost killed me?
it is not going to solve anything.
a great opportunity squandered?
what is michael seeing right now?
I am temporarily lifting the shun.
dwight's rights.
on the phone.
fact: you are drinking grape soda.
he would always get rolled over by something.
i happen to think the old ways of doing business are better.
phyllis!
how long have you worked here?
you do not what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back.
do it.
normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I have been through.
you are still here.
oh, kevin!
well we  should make a list.
I have decided that on my drives to nashua, i am going to learn french, the language of love.
you are not leaving.
show me some attitude.
you should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year.
what, uh... .
that is what she said.
very well.
oh okay.
is this the tape of me falling?
i can not hear you!
hey.
this is my grandmother's ring.
captain jack says you should look at the moon.
managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life.
you should be teaching me.
does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?
no.
i got some stomach cramps.
come on.
robert.
never see it coming.
he is my tribe.
i pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." open-mindedness, is that even a word?
ok, umm, i think, that is either the hudson or the east, so we are back,  should be back this way.
the only signal that i am sending is: <i>gay, good</i>.
you can not steal what is legally your property.
you know what?
ah, fell asleep, took a nap.
such a chorus girl.
dwight, it is couples only.
but i always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.
why are not they building it themselves?
just give me another chance.
just really grabs your attention.
ahem-hem-hem.
oh, umm, ever since i started here, I have kept a diary of all my sales.
okey doke.
oh, you know what?
yeah, ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that i picked up on, which said, "dude, we are friends.
oh really?
we just did it.
ok, feel better.
good for you.
were you listening to what i was saying?
it is next.
and ... okay.
you?
what will you do?
imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so i thank you.
michael.
oh.
yeah, i hear that.
you wrote down those fake diseases did not you?
what do i do?
he just, he is always, he is always talking about people behind their backs to me.
roy dates pam.
all right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today.
i cannot promise you that.
I will tell you about my ideal dinner party.
would someone just make the copy?
i-i have been steeped in anticipation.
no need to stampede, sir.
and it should not stop us from having fun.
sold in record time.
hey!
see how that works out for you.
let us get back to this.
after me.
shoot, shoot it.
alright!
michael!
you are a young hotshot from stark industries.
cracked?
for gooood!
it will take like two seconds.
charley horse!
guns n' roses.
did you hear what i said?
chair, lamp, plant, table leg, jim's leg.
no, no, no.
can we have a moment?
bye.
i have hemorrhoids!
there are clouds in the sky, which means going to rain, bad for business.
hey nice to see you again, aj.
aha!
christmas!!!!
that is wrecked.
i should go, and start my own paper company.
i need to see your pupils.
um, before i tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
why?
woohoo!
do not lose your head.
lick the spoon?
cool.
here is another good idea.
what are you supposed to be?
but do not take my word for it.
last thing i need is luck.
her boobs, definitely.
there is tons of ideas in there.
you guys are young, that is great.
let us see it.
hey, you know what would even be better?
do you want to get some breakfast or something?
well i hope 1985 has a time machine because i drive an 87. speaking of funerals, why do not you go ahead and go die.
i think you are doing a great job.
what... what is that?
why do not you have a seat?
hello, january well, i was letting everybody go to the big diwali party.
which is you!
thanks.
i can not shop at a fancy norwegian boutique.
yeah, well, i was told that holly would be here, single and ready to date.
i know, i know, we will wait.
here is the rub.
here is a kelly complaint: "ryan never returns my calls." ugh, join the club.
yeah... i... you know what... i... i... i just thought about it.
i see what you are doing.
yeah.
you are a good salesman.
and in ten years, i am living in a big house, with my kids.
we are playing zone!
wrong.
do some... do some work.
yeah.
why do they call him the bus?
you have got to stay for the big presentation we have got this young wiz kid -- ryan.
wish i could have gone with ryan on that cool retreat!
no?
one step at a time.
you did not cover it at all.
it was rotting.
well, it looks like there will not be any operation give back.
hey you said you were going to be out of town this weekend.
dwight, are you talking about us?
or court.
oh, very thoughtful.
life-size.
he went to gabe behind your back.
and this is where we first made love.
