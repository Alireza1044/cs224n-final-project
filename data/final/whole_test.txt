he is either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain.
i got in the way.
i appreciate the feedback.

lists are good.
we have a colleague with the same name.
i have no feeling in my fingers or penis.
mike myers, genius.

the boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised.
dwight, i want you to be in charge of the press conference.

this is the most important day of the year.
my god, these could be tracings!

this is a leadership training exercise.
that is probably throwing you off a little bit.
I will order you some cranberry juice.
everybody, i want you to look at holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what i see in her.
how did you make that happen?
um.
oh, thank you my dear.
cop a squat.
compliment accepted.
which was recently discovered to be a front for the taliban.
shhh!
i want you to get your ass out of my face.
but, i cannot accept, because i have been thinking about it, and i think i want to go back to sales.
because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
he is like our mr. bean.
and i would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
ry-an.
i invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff.
for all your paper and printer needs.
like for tax purposes.
shirts on or off?
how difficult would that have been?
i am going to google sulfur maps.

what are the options?
sorry to interrupt.
it is your problem.
okay, okay!
come here you.

as a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
a sudden burst of light.
I will save you!
so, do you know what you are going to say when he shows up?
most do in the magazines.
i know.
good.
right there.
everyone stop moving!
oh, place around the corner.
yes!
there is the x-ax...icks.
mr. handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes.
just when we were getting going.
i never want to see you working in the upstairs office again.
ahhhhh.
half an hour.
dwight!
well, okay.
.
to have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'wow.
no.
you are next!
come on, stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
swag!
I am not going to slam you up against the wall.
she thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.
take the stairs!
absolutely, i will.
you want me to pick you up anything?
because i am manager of the scranton branch of dunder mifflin.
no, ryan would never do it.
i told you it would not break.
angela, you are up.
so say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers.
impressive office you have here.
oh, boy.
it... leadership off-site.
hey, you know what?
something like fat or smelly.
ah, too bad we do not have the good stuff here.
gives me a chance to sow my wild oats.
my employees.
hey, oww!
it is okay.
okay.
hey!
the fact that we have rules.
jim, how dare you.
my real beef with her, though, pam?
it is by the tenderloin.
my sales dream team.
just, you know, find it.
so, well, ok. see you guys on monday.
sorry!
hey, did you miss that day there, ryan?
and totally against the spirit of christmas.
jim.
attention, everybody.
we do not?
where he will then leave me to either die or to survive.
i made him what he is today.
i was a fool to think that i could beat it.
i know, i know, i know, I am sorry.
erin?
wait, wait, wait.
andale!
she is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office.
well, let me show you how it is done.
he... he has facial hair.
because everybody says so.
and that is when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.
i need you to perform a test.
I am going to... you take care of that.
do we save sales?
let me present you.
still good.
ah, the old "leave behind." oldest trick in the book.
the athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
and by the way, uh, i told her not to, but she is coming over here and she is furious.
huh!
are you kidding me?
yes.
dwight, i was open.
orientation is over.
a little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up.
are those the customer surveys?
you are so welcome, mon.
oh, well, that is fine.
parkour!
rock and roll!
i wonder if he knows?
is not that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
there is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?
we could have met in the lobby.
you know who else did not go to business school?
you are thinking of a chicken.
i do not think so, no.
okay, ryan.
this just... it is the sales... i see the sales department down there.
there he is tony... what is your last name?
we do not - it does not have to be paper.
boring.
yes, this is business.
you are so lucky you do not have this problem.
oftentimes, in hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders.
i can not tell you.
i have egg in my crocs.
hello little pill.
oww!
so why does not everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to florida and andy and i will listen to it.
no.
thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing.
ah, the ruger family.
been manager?
that would not even make sense.
well, no.
late every day this week.
oh yeah.
all right.
that is... you have just been drawing pictures.
because you are engaged to andy.
thank you.
come in.
well, jan's email password is not dunder mifflin, sandals, jamaica, michael, michael scott, jan scott, or mrs. jan scott.
that is all that matters!
let us see if any of these will work.
what are you doing?
yeah.
maybe i was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
that is the difference between you and i.  business is not about money to me, david.
snip snap!
you know what you can keep your stupid favor.
i do not care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... i never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I would just like to say...  con-quack-ulations!
hey, hey.
really.
excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom did not they?
i did nothing.
i think maybe hank should be here.
only that he carries the vampiric germ.
oh, wow, wow.
probably about the extremes of the human physique.
all, you have to close right now.
all right everybody, circle up.
you do not want to know.
it was.
i am, but you are the eva peron to my cesar chavez.
I will give you one last chance to come clean.
no, they are not.
huh.
and at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab." i do.
because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
your friend got engaged.
then you are an idiot.
you shaved?
who else?
oh, how much is this going to cost?
bildenkinder.
you are coming with me.
what are you doing?
he was a gawky, tall salesman.
great.
mmm!
that is not how you go camping.

captain mutato is half man, half mermaid.
i do not feel like peanut butter.
... with coffee but without the haunted.
I am a little peeved at darryl right now.
hi, i am well, how are you?
yes, crap.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
ok, this is unacceptable.
you know what?
close the door if you would.
no.
how many courses did we have tonight, two?
do not you!
i mean, not because you are gay.
how could that happen?
and when they came over on the mayflower.
so i tailed her for six straight nights.
it is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
give me the phone.
okay, I am going to give it shot.
fine.
i just do not understand why i was not even interviewed for the job.
lonely people mixing with one another?
i might have gotten it after her.
no!
all right, listen up.
what is a book?
yeah.
and he eats the same kind of paper i do.
hello.
if i were buying my coffin, i would get one with thicker walls so you could not hear the other dead people.
symphonies do not have any money.
pam, what you do not understand is that at my level you just do not look in the want-ads for a job.
these are not my shoes.
he swiped the security tape for me and he is bringing it over.
no!
700 and one penny.
because there is only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in ohio and not be charged with a crime.
you should grow candy.
it may be the person you least suspect.
hello!
michael.
accounting?
let us get him inside.

"i regret my actions.
what do you say?
go on.
unbelievable.
ladies and gentlemen, i have an announcement to make.
i basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then i find out that one of my best ones did.
because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
dwight, shh shh.
you are a guy... too... sort of.
all right!
yeah!
what is our presentation about?
it is my fetish.
just push and breathe.
of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
all right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative.
it is been a week, and i still can not believe it.
I am not hungry.
i just have an announcement to make.
and that is something that you learn when you go to jamaica, and you really apply yourself.
how then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in china has risen by 17% and in the us it has only risen by 8%?
should have had hindsight.
if it is stanley's, call the offices of james p. albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
mighty worker.
hmm... jim?
all right?
well, we can start this paper company.
i would like them to meet my new girlfriend.
I am going to throw you this ball.
to change lives.
i... am being replaced, as your leader, by dwight.
hello.
wish i could, but i can not.
i agree.
sure.
what is that?
if you agree, say nothing.
probably the best advice you ever gave me, dwight.
oh we know.
why do not you guys get to know each other?
all right, all right, all right, all right.
game over.
eat it phyllis!
dwight, dwight!

on your mark!
what?
carb up.
hey, sport.
they call it that because of the electricity.
the main part with the buildings.
i have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place.
this is the good stuff, mattress quality.
zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison.
you told me that several times.
you cut it with water?
you will find love.
i listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
thank you michael, for staying on.
i think it was someone really popular.
we would never get off the runway.
going around shirtless all day.
i think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.
oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
well, i just got off the phone with january  and um... she demoted me.
if you have got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away.
you mad at me?

"mental" is part of the word, i have underlined it.
the electric city.

i questioned myself.
you are not a liar too are you?
this is fun.
forget it!

yeah, you said... i can handle that.
probably make  them feel like wimps.
side of candied pams.
how do i explain this to jan?
maybe he is bowling.
okay.
my bladder is full.
really really good.
wild, and i have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well.
okay.
oh, wait, you do not get one.
oh no, no, no.
i got this so i can write down for thank-you notes.
oh that feels better.
no, jan!
...and now the black guy from the 'police academy' movies.
hold on.
it is uh, it is uh, very sexual.
it is called prerogative.
i have my hbo comedy special, here i go again dot-dot-dot.
i saved 3 years salary.
my boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and i have always been intrigued by all things international.

or do you <i>know</i>?
david will always beat goliath.
we were all chatting and i made a joke, a really dumb joke and craig the idiot took it seriously.
self fulfilling prophecy.
before i shoot you in the head.
i do not know.
oh, you have your own entrance.
yes, i have a wig for every single person in the office.
so this is one of my favorite places in the world.
uh huh.
you even do so little as grant me an interview, i will guarantee you your dream work life.
the cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions.
the holster was a gift from my great-uncle honk.
credit where credit is due, okay?
breathing.
let us do it.
nn... no.
not in a million, billion years.
you know we live together, right?
i know what a lot of you must be thinking.
could you just let me...  every time... every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  i take care of my kid!
there you go.
ummm, well I would have to talk to my mother and my guy at h and r block.
it is a really wonderful moment.
jan, have you ever had deer?
jim, dwight, andy and stanley.
hi, oscar its michael.
i had not noticed.
did you have a good lunch?
idiot.
did you see the board?
and that you had said some things about kevin.

you people are revolting.
let us move that up.
i know i do.
okay.
why do not... hey.
this guy does it all.
i do not care if it is pizza.
uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids.
this next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.
assistant team manager?
so, kevin and creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
that is over several months, ryan.
the media can make you famous.
uh, here is the thing.
oh, come on.
extreme!
wish me luck!
this is a good day.
what about oscar?
did you explain why?
I am stopping now.
hank, thank god you are here.
hold it!
she has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
I am just a cleaning lady.
there is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any sabre printers.
no, he is not.
onk onk.
let us do your performance review- ah, why, that is great news?
jim.
hello, spoiled little baby,  in your fancy brand name stroller.
that is not appropriate.
hey buddy, what are you up to?
go back that is not good.
that was mean.
every morning.
really?
there is no gum.
we are off.
jan, i defend your honor.
no, this is where i work.
what we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here.
yes.
this is not going to work out.
i missed you kevin.
but he is an everyday guy.
tell me what they are.
oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good.
hit it!
word.
my question: do i do it as the man?
go on!
the man has a point.
anything your heart desires.
but instead it is like godfather one!
well, now i can say that i went to a museum.
psych!
oh.
and everyone, whatever hank decides, that is the decision.
ok. um, the last word is "seagulls." i took a lot from other poems.
pamela morgan beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
leapfrog!
i have a laundry machine!
excuse me?
hey, hey, hey.
no, red hair is my area.
what is the exact square footage.
he has got this very likable way about him.
you need to clean your ears better.
you heard anything yet?
anyone know what we do next?
start hanging those.
no?
i just, i fell in love with those kids.
okay.
lazy scranton, the electric city.
it was love at first see with my ears.
yeah, you took it too slow.
we-yeah, they are very-they are different.
I am sure he would give a reference.
and it worked.
hank down at security had clocked out.
see ya, drive safely.
when it came to manured fields, angela was at best indifferent.
what I am saying... and weirdly I am a good dog person, right guys?
so i think i know what i need to do at this point.
yup.
"michael, it is january  i guess i missed you".
you want to separate the head from the thorax- hello.
this is a business scenario.
this is what we are going to do.
come on!
or both of you?
thanks, bye.
i have to make some sales anyway.
dwight, you are such a liar.
are you going to make another pro and con list?
how many of you can say that you love going to work every day like bavon?
I am going to call her.
right?
i like his hair.
i do not, i do not think I am ready.
you are getting past it.
we are very proud of you.
and also, i would like to say that i will be canceling my trip down to tallahassee.
i love candy.
whoo.
and earlier today, i was freaking out.
alright who is next?
okay, so no salami in the pants.
just pay for it and we will reimburse you when you get back.
do you know who the real heroes are?
cheer me up.
maybe.
well, mr. kurt russell, you are about to be served.
very well, we will come back at 5:15. any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife, do you want me to translate the german instructions for you?
to understand me, you have to know that i work in the city, but i live here on this small, beautiful farm.
creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
anybody?
battlestar galactica is not a documentary exactly.
dwight schrute here.
wait, it is not d.m utica, is it?
i do not think yours will fit me.
everybody.
sound good?
yeah, but who put it here?
some people never figured it out.
and packer told them that we were brothers.
r thinks he is too good to be here, and p is not as much fun without jim.
i have made my decision.
i am ashamed at your naked face.
you are still here.
was i saying anything interesting?
did i make more of what we had then what was really there?
we better.
i have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking german.
ohh, i enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I have learned so much from them.
i totally understand.
hold down the fort, i have to do something.
hustle!
and because you are gettin' old.
one thing about me, i am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
do not take no for an answer.
plus, that convertible, it is a ridiculous choice for this climate.
how can you eat like that?
you would not believe what happened here.
you know how many we have here?
what is going on?
you started with this company, as a fine young man... oh, okay.
or worse!
it is sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not i had them- okay, i think we are set.
well, it is not a little foggy there is actually something going on here- do i?
whatever you call it, i am running away from my responsibilities.
here is my wish.
yeah, ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that i picked up on, which said, "dude, we are friends.
come on!
it does not just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
i do not know what your body feels like because i can not touch it.
no... you are crazy.
brainstorming session is now open.
they are not.
and then i inserted my penis- into your- vagina and- admit that there is a chance.
okay, all right.
and i have not been there in months.
by an alien life form.
ah, well, good.
seriously, how did you do it?
no, it is not insane, oscar.
the city's laid out from east to west and our public parks are libraries are truly the best.
now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.
i have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
um, nothing.
you know what, I am going to take that one step further.
inside you will see many pelts.
I am on it.
no... no.
I will be damned if I am going to let us lose me.
yuck, pew!
wow, i am blown away by this.
hey, it just takes one!
okay!
yes.
well, well, well.
i am worried.
what can i do to make it more perfecter?
i wish you luck, toby.
i need to know... who shot johnson!
where is he?
ok.  oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes.
could be one month, could be two months.
that is the fun of this place.
alright.
he seems like a mobster.
lay them on me.
my name is michael scarn.
leave me alone, ghoul.
mm hm.
how about angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which oscar wears.
six?
knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
and i will not miss him.
call a client right now.
it bothers me that you are not answering the question.
halpert, room d1.
oh!
i regret offending my coworkers.
you know what?
ow.
cool, calm, and collected 24/7.
so... and andy is gay.
okay.
do not look down.
and limo lady, we are going completely carbon neutral.
thank you.
what are you guys talking about?
it is time, thank you.
wha... since you did such a good job with the investigation, i decided to pull a few strings.
can i just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
I am screaming, I am screaming, I am screaming!
i was thinking of entering it into some festivals.
okay, alright.
it has a cassette and it has a cd.
okay.
this was a fake firing.
are you making a- toby.
and everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.
nobody should have to go to work thinking, "oh, this is the place that i might die today."  that is what a hospital is for.
what does josh mcauliffe know about the paper business?
margaret thatcher said that about marriage.
by contrast, i went to sleep with an erection so large it was like i was wearing no blanket at all.
i-- i--  nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a nerf, that... yeah... you are... ah, so right.
yes, and the reason i did not get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she is not really the kind of person you would think would be into valentine's day.
ha, going to flip you!
may i?
"schindler's list" parody.
everybody's getting their chance.
what?
okay, all right.
what?
where is the nurse?
this place is like spaniard fly.
absolutely... not.
does anybody else know about this?
was that his name?
he grew into a man overnight.
can you believe this?
I will take a burger over a gross philly cheese-steak any day.
i heard you say "well" the first time.
I am sure bavon gets sick of his job, too.
look.
really?
guys, she is in there.
that is the inside of your vagina!
take a gander.
in our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything.
all right.
oh, mmm, i wish i had time to change it, but jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?
look at the outside of this building.
and do not call me shirley.
in fact, i challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
three words or less.
right?
here we go  oh god.
ah.
no fingers will be laid on phyllis.
can i put you down for 10 pounds?
oh.
oh my god, come on ... oh shhhh-oot!
no.

you were all successories!
this is weird.
hey.
there are copies in the bathroom?
this is the reason we are here.
do not you love it?
absolutely.
ohh!
growing up, i performed my own circumcision.
oh.
alright.
schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade.
this is jim!
yeah, that is smart.
nashua branch." can i send them a dead deer?
i can hear and see everything.
i need a box.
here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles.
we do not blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions.
there is face models, hand models, body models  - yes.

I am at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations i made over six months ago.

you just need to realize that so much rides on this.
oh, i still have more.
bow chicka bow.
i mean, seriously.
listening happens in the ear and in the brain.
i am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.

uh, pam, will you get angela and meet us in the conference room please?
she is hilarious.

i just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving pda or public displays of affection.
ok. well, i thought I would show you around a little bit - - since you made the trip out.
oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
for kelly, that seems a bit much.
if anything i am robbing the grave.
no, there are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases.
i think the conference room should be fine.
if you said "I am sorry" in front of everybody.
where does gayness come from?
kelly.
okay?
I am going to make this way harder than it needs to be.
oh, man!
what you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her.

just give me another chance.
it is, um, put it back.
cover your nose and mouth.
a sale or a lead or... ah.

i might do the spin.
superior genes.

how do i apply?
they want to set up their own version of an apple store.
thank you.
it is ok. it is nothing, I am robbing her.
you are a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.
so i would say that the old boss has always been good to dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs.
nothing.
and besides, i would not want to take you away from pam on the morning of her wedding.
I am going to be thinking about how many friends i have, and my children, and my comedy albums.
she is really cool.
yeah, sorry about that.
nothing how ya doing?
a woman.

i have to hear it from her.
con- you look like a nerd.
there is some seed money for you.
okay.

uh, i better tell somebody.
i do not own dunder mifflin, okay?
something about that seems inappropriate.
expenses.
merry christmas, little children!
dwight, can i talk to you for a second?
all right, favorite moments in dunder-mifflin history.
unless everybody can agree on something better?
but... okay, do not spoil it for everybody, all right?
federal and state.
oh, yeah right.
good to be a homeowner.
uh, this is dwight schrute calling for jan levenson-gould.
or, duality of man.
get rid of it.
but sweet because david wallace thought i did a good job.
attention, everybody.
post-its.
no, no no, no.
tails.

no kidding.
i am feeling this.
ten.
i know where to sign.
that is just what we need, another black man in prison.
maybe a whole theme, like a rap.
we make  them come to work, and we work  them, and we make  them sit next to all the people they screwed over.
swing and a miss.
and, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy.
oh, ok. let me just cut to the chase, dwight.
that is an amusing link.
it is going to be awesome.
this is disgusting.
uhhh... nothing.
you have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which i hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
nine and three-quarters.
well, no, not trying to fit in.
happy birthday to you.
michael scott.

never mind, jim.
yeah.
subrahmanyan chandrasekhar.
tell him i will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay?
wha's up my brutha?
man, it is like hoisting a manatee.
this meeting is for knights of the night only.
oh really, what role is that?
it is a classic management tactic.
apology rejected.
excellent!
we are grrrrrrrrrreat!"  i do not know, could be good.
okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
I am good.
i was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.
do not ask me for a raise.
I am sorry.
what do i write?
it is hard for me to imagine a scenario, where meredith palmer keeps her job and david wallace does not - no offense meredith.
you did get the e-vite to my barbeque!
if you think that is going to have any effect on me, it will not.
I am studying with the master, huh?
you can take the man out of the salesman, but you can not take the sales out of salesman.
all right, you know what?
yes.
we are just office drones.
are you okay?
i do not buy it.
i can make him talk, michael.
let us go.
admit it.
it looks cute though.
okay, you can... fast forward.
ladies and gentleman, threat level: midnight.
oh, okay.

extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions.
nah, I am okay.

I am sorry it makes me nervous.
and i do not care if that convict is white, black, asian, german, or some kind of halfsy.
anyone want to... pump up?
well, i need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.
oh.
you have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
no.
the 45 day thing that i outlined, we go with that.
i will destroy everything in my path- beep!
this is like when the freshmen would throw a party and would not let any of the seniors go.
i have got to make sure that youtube comes down to tape this.
or... that is it.
then i will.
you did not need to do that.
very funny jim.
computron, I am going to pull your plug.

or the funny things that they can do, like "where is the beef?"   yeah.
well then my man meat, he shall have.
stanley.
good to see ya, have a seat.
i like where you are going with this.
that would be shallow.

and you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change.
it is not olden times anymore.
my branch is absorbing the stamford branch.
what?
andy?
oh, dear god in heaven.
what?
i dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice.
this is no good.
yeah, well, phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so.
mose, what are you doing?
the important thing is... this kept us secure people.
it squeaks when you bang it, that is what she said.
step forward.
ah, me so horny.
i invited everyone in the office because it is not a day for just jim or pam or the baby or me.
do something!
no, that was... that was legitimate.
and i grabbed this suit.
i should have fired you.
in our room.
get set.
yes.
yeah, andy.
i have a name, close your eyes.
any messages?
and then ... and then suddenly she is not yo' ho no mo'.
let us go help africa.
how dare you sir.
all right.
they are going to call it mema.
can you reprimand him?
oh, that is perfect!
i know a great taxidermist.
next slide.
it is mother nature.
yes.
sure you can not stay a little longer?
toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it.
I am taking all the credit." okay, well, that is because he is paying their salary.
seven?
so it is not true.
well, we have learned that you can not teach an old dog new tricks, because it is illegal, and you will go to jail.
you need to come by your sales honorably!
excuse me.
no.
you will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
and the breakfast.
well--no, no--n-- we need a winch and a hoist.
coffee?
as your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you will age swiftly and poorly.
oh, that sounds awesome.
i can, and i have.
jim is on a path now.
yeah.
no, you idiot.
yep.
woo!
a lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
that is not funny.
um... literally two seconds?
just... well... crystal.
so, umm... thanks for coming by.
erin....the receptionist!
well, toby, i went all-in on the first hand, so does not that tell you that i might have good cards, too?
you deserve it!
i bet you have.
ah.
jim and karen are here, which is cute.
okay.
remember how you felt when you thought you would seen roger clemens?
okay, alright.
when you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?
okay.
sold in record time.
and yesterday, they gave me this.
did you?
does it have a deck?
yes, it was that.
she is young, she is beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them.
i like this.
i grab this , and i turn it on and i say, "prepare yourself, for the utica chain store massacre." no, do not worry, the chain is off.
no, this is a war, and i will not stop, i will not rest.
he messed it up.
and you can hug it out, bitch.
oh okay.
that is the word on the street anyway.
no?
ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let us do it.
let us see here.
so did creed.
okay fine, i get it.
everybody else is past it.
what?
come on i need this.
he is on the phone.
you have to point to a specific part of the body.
come on!
i mean anybody could be gay.
come on.
there it goes.
i do not... remember.
ok, sweetie.
i never recommended you because i did not want to lose you and i did not want to lose pam,  and now i do not want to lose the baby.
that is a beauty, is not it?
i can not wait to be a father.
but you know what?
jim, what is that called?
you too.
i lied to michael.
david got fired.
what i do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
yeah, it is all him and michael talk about anymore.
it would not be fair.
yes.
you will break it.
that is by far the best way to strengthen your core.
and lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as nana starts to... but, i knew i should be saving it for something, i just did not know what i should be saving it for.
the giant baby.
did you ever think of that?
i will call him later with that message.
could be interesting.
i do not understand it, but you do not get to understand everyday of your life.
this is a work bus.
go ahead.
ooh!
yeah!
everyone, follow me to the shelter.
because I have got nothing got lose.
oh, okay.
ready?
and then packer did both of them.
we could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they are out of the house.
you are bad.
well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the gilligan thing, so... right now, i was thinking.
no more.
check out these pants.
good.
it was not.
you know i have some things i need to do this weekend.
that is a 200 dollar plasma screen tv you just killed!
i like  them.
that is where they remove the uterus.
how would you have wanted to do it?
there you are.
there it is.
we offer tours of the fields, and of the barn.
love.
check that out.
what is going on?
and if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than i am.
ok, come on.
cracked?
pointless.
here we go.
so... why do not we try this out, we will see what would happen.
give me the phone.
you... oh.
pam?
might as well of been toilet paper.
i have excellent sales numbers!
hey!
you just immediately go to that, dwight?
I am digging.
when you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real.
it is quite literally a drug that speeds people up.
the old michael scott might have taken this, but not the new michael scott.
welcome!
no.
you guys ever protect the president?
andy, what is the problem?
"you are foir-ed."  i think if i had a catchphrase it would be, "you are hired, and you can work here as long as you want." but that is unrealistic, so... get set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott.
and, I am sorry.
jo, please... i will - shut up.
yes, well about some things, and other things i am very stupid.
no, no, no.
go ahead .
um... check your spam folder.
god.
because I have got monies to move around.
i have country crock.
and now i no longer own an arctic wolf.
i have hemorrhoids!
yes, yes.
why hello!
screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow.
what was that, kevin?
it is kind of dark out there.
no... you know what jim, this is not about me anymore.
not real.
sounds good.
these are our demands.
three!
it is never too early for ice cream, jim.
you know what, it was not just me.
done.
my only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later.
uh-oh.
i can do that, it is my office.
maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
it definitely looks suspicious.
sir.
please do not listen to this boob!
okay, everybody here?
andy.
all right.
after breakfast.
hi stranger.
yeah!
the doctor says, there is no way i can operate on this boy, ... a man is found hanging from the ceiling... a hunter.

okay, who moved my desk?
it is a christmas miracle!
i mean- do you ever wrestle with each other?
wow.

I am on it!
maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.
ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can not be openly violent.
yeah.
here we go.
this wedding is officially out of your hands.
but a good informer does not judge what is worth passing on.

pam.

what?
so much of this is just impossible to verify.
crazy world.

we are going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are.
okay, all right.
pam, I will help you.
due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
and i would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
oh!
how do you know the happy couple?
if you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
yeah.
i like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.
it is nitrogen!

it is just a load of b.c.
how did we do it?

i did.
i want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.
all right, andy, please.

phyllis, stanley.

okay, go ahead, they are right.
come on, it will be fun.
deactivate the car alarm.
he is a traitor!
the first person to shout "shotgun" when you are within the sight of the car gets the front seat.
I will do your laundry for a month!
it may have been the costliest decision I have ever made.
yes you did.
you are old.
we had a nurse, but she quit because she was "poisoned" by aunt shirley.
well can, but will not.
okay.
i have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.
all right.
it was not just an action movie, it was die hard!
we are circling it.
no work.
that is been- right, standard.
so, sexy is fun... hey, you know what?
but I am the godfather.
these resolutions should be about you, and i made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
uh, no way.
no!
have you made any sales yet?
oh, no problem.
no.
but most importantly we need to get her some medical attention.
it was really sad.
his father ran the freaking country, okay?
now, we are getting three people each.
uh, dwight?
jo likes michael.
time for me to find out.
that is my line, that is... i always say that at weddings.

but we did because we were ahead.
oh, ok. is that suppose to come off?
I will just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love.
alright, let us bang this out.
oh, yeah.
well... i swallowed all your ideas, I am going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
no!
i did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and i just thought you were speaking abnormally.
um, but i am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success.
milk and sugar.
maybe.
okay?
look, look.
ohh, ohh.
god!
do we speak english?
should i... turn, no.
how about a woman?
i can not serve you.' she might have been.
oh, why do i feel like crap?
i could manage my way around that.
no, you are not-you are not fired.
get lost.
do not break the branches, dwight.
we should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse?
let us go home.
you make that yourself?
i want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office.
that is his profit.
you know what I am thinking?
you know, jim, those are just words.
in die hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter.
memo to january i deserve a raise.

hey, january how you doing?
yeah, yeah, yeah.
kevin, please leave.
no, i am not going to tell them.

this was so stupid.
i can tell.

dwight, they called your name.

I am actually calling because I am in love with her.
i did not say anything!
let us go.
that is ok. this is bull****!
wow.
well... bleh busted.
boom!
what?
this is a fine precision instrument.
everyone wants the ipod.
maybe five, ten days a year, I will get home and i will have no idea what the hell just happened.
get it over with.
so if i was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield- i would not be asking you lightly, now would i?
welcome.
oh, ho, ho, ho.
i love hunting.
so i will cede her to you.
and meredith needs this job.
and that does not sit right with me.
i just need some alone time.

he looks scared.
i... oh, that is red eye.
that is the sanest thing I have ever heard.
we are.
no.
oh, really nothing?
yes she does.

my first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
she is such a weirdo!
they are going to have nightmares, so why do not you just shut it?
no.
oh, what are those?
i am nigh!
andy, i will volunteer.
we destroy the evidence.
just try not to be too gay on the court.
you are correct, sir!
that!
how many fingers am i holding up?
what?
and you cannot screw around there.
hello, gabe.
which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
you want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra.
it was fine.
okay.
i was born ready.
hold it, hold it.
he would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
the romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we have remained good friends.
i want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me.
I am getting a call.
get them out of here!
that is based on your past behavior.
i signed up for second life about a year ago.
okay?
roasted.
if you do not, that is fine.
you know, because i care about this project.
what is our receptionists name?
i would like to see those please.
ok, excuse me.
and I am going to go watch the movie with people who think it is great!
meredith.
it makes you real stupid.
who is dr. perry?
not enough blood getting to my hands.
unless they mean toby.
i thought i found a lump.
this does not feel as important though.
hey!
in a funny way, like it is a hilarious joke?
oh, somebody is got a new phone!
the office is yours.
i think I am being very clear what I am asking.
no.
the babies that i make with her, will be my children.
I am sorry.
i am such a stupid idiot.
this is a project I have been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
united in applause.
and i do not care what any stupid scale says.
you would think they would be sick of each other by now.
michael, listen.
well the invitation says vip's only.
the bouncer chases us out to packer's vette, jump in the vette, he <i>peels out</i>, and i  i do not make it to the car.
oh, man.
i am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.
because i know you like putting q-tips deep into your ear canal.
it is complicated with january  and i do not know where i stand, or what i want.
so I am going to go inside.
look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.
who?
hello everyone, i am michael scott.
some panties or... pick a thong or... g-string.
pan around there.
now you believe in dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
i say, bring it on.
want to be a manager?
ohhhh!
i can not, i can not... i can not change anything.
and inform.
do any of the two hand activities that you will miss the most.
good.
may you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
okay!
his name is toby flenderson  and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in central america.
stop spraying!
because you went with michael scott.
there he is!
please?
here is how you do it:  you line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time.
they spit.
it is time to motivate.
we have jim.
so you think you know a lot about business?
it is none of your business.
each and every one of you.
i have because.
a school for mexicans?
pam.
I have had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch- no!
yes you did.
we have only just begun.
that will not be necessary.
um.
so, I am a little overwhelmed.
no brainer, right?
your stupid friend zone.
i found it at spencer gifts.
a lot better than hers, that is for sure.
it finally downloaded.
i have a roommate, uh, vijay chokalingham, he is a sophomore at queens college.
ah, I am trying not to touch you.
"life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...sometimes you deal with it, today you do not, sometimes you do, what you want... there is a world out there....
let us go!
it is the only time he can do it.
it could be a lookie-loo.
take heed of.
I have seen that pond.
in 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2. that is a very good record.
heh.
okay, secretary says wallace is away for the day and will not be coming back into the office.
3,000 g's.
we are not mad, we are just disappointed.
pam!
i talked to her-holly.
i should leave.
i had sex with her.
can i drive?
sort of a humble thing.
you know, it is funny.
let us remember those procedures.
great.
here is what I would like to do.
oh!
the word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation.
we are playing zone!
i would greatly appreciate it.
this is a stinger.
we meet him in a public place.
I am smart.
he came in 9th in the apple creek derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year.
nobody likes to work late, least of all me.
that is the way you should enter a room.
ok... alright... here we go.
come on!
now she knows what it is like to be a minority.
interesting.
yeah?
stop.
we have an offer from washington university.
ryan?
that is wrecked.
wait, what holly said?
use it in good health.
oh, that is appropriate.
when i was young, i spent several years at a private school where i was told i would be taught to harness my mutant abilities.
let us do this.
you infants, let us move.
me too, get in the car.
actually, you should... better hold onto  them pills, just in case.
and then prey on their emotions.
hot-dog fingers.
thanks.
look at what you are wearing again, pam.
i will get out.
oh do not go.
now it is all about my instincts.
me, me, me, me, me, me.
I am not even going to dance one song.
okay, twiggy, that is enough.
makin' progress.
wow.
on my part, i did manage to reserve the... let us get the party started.

ugh, forget it.
monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.

ah.
bye now.
send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
i promised i was not going to make a toast and I am not going to.

and expresso.
hey linda, can i get a picture of you?
i have... okay.
net.
that is all.
man-boy!
i ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
I would say she was the closest thing i had to an aunt.
no, it is not.
the best.
i have to say, i think the problem with that whole thing... ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
completely true.
yes.
no, I am no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person.
this young man needs to learn that is not how you treat people.
I am going out of town.
I am greek!
i mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
here, pussy.
night after night, town after town, all across america.
thank you.
you were playing too.
come on.
good night.

and I am glad i did.
that is a metaphor i guess.
these meetings are useless.

let me smell.
listen, I am calling you to tell you a little joke.
is not that right princess?
that is what oscar said.
that sounds like a very real thing, toby.
you and pam.
you are it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause.
no tricks.
it was playful hazing.
we are going to switch back and forth, the driving.
you know why?
excuse me.
...you were at the dentist?
well, it is not really a big speech.
what is the matter... haaaww!
you, are you sure you do not want a pony?
well, we are both just kind of learning as we go, are not we?
do you want a better life, danny?
yeah!
and the piranha's a rescue.
okay, you know what toby?
here we go!
do you feel it?
well, they need our money.
excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
I am just worried about my friend.
who suggested cake?
let us not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.
well, i passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee.
or is that something that we write in later?
on behalf of jim and i, merry christmas.
he just accepted, accepted that i put all this work into it!
so, why did you and karen break up?
be prepared to hold folks  from 9 am to... nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions... ...for people's behavior.
I am... I will work it out.
come on, buddy.
we are going bankrupt, you think?
"way to go man, jan's really hot." look, we are twins.

I am not sure, um, mountainton?
yeah.
sheriff pierce?
uh, knock, please.
this is scott.
assemble a sales team.
i think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah?
well, yeah.
what is that?
a little old-fashioned hazing.
so.
well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and i just do not... i do not know.
well, yeah, yes.
shake my hand.
michael is gone.
I am sorry i said that, i did not... just part of me meant it.

several cars have flipped.
but the truth is, i can not do this.
the women, the pancakes, the man of mystery... meredith, i would like you to pretend that you are from abu dhabi.
people are going to get sea sick watching this.
excellent!
this is important.
oh hello oscar mayer weiner lover.
"there is no way, i will resign.
it is like the devil's cursive.
that was exactly what i was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that is a compliment.
oh, really?
yes.
tell them that i died, and i turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common.
back off!
suck it!
i can tell if you are lying.
please, I am always the guy you rely on at work.
look, look, look.
i will get to that definitely.

we are going to beat this, okay?
it is just a farty dirt patch.
come on guys.
you are the idiot!
okay team, let us get back to work!
i am not going to give up that easy.
sexual time bomb.
it is futile.
when i think about it, when i really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
stir the melting pot, pam!
i do not know what he is searching for out here.
no, I am leo dicaprio!
funny.
and yet he is my friend.
it is good.
how much time do you have?
i want you to get your head together, and then come back in.
you are a gentleman and a scholar.
um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
i, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
oh, bruce willis.
sometimes you really creep me out.
stop, stop, stop!
yes!
no.
i have a lot of toilet ideas.
i tell a police officer, i know several, what i suspect you may have in your car.

"... to remain friends.
this is bull!
howard gruber.
that way you can see what it looks like when you are up here.
i do not ... have no idea.
that is a little kinky.
that you might even be a little bit dangerous.
spinal cord!
that is not what i was going to ask.
we all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like dunder mifflin... are going to fall by the wayside.
no.
sure.
oh, thanks.
this is totally unprofessional.
how?
it is the closest that the irish will ever get to christmas.

the good news is... they can not fire all of us, right?
you are clean.
eel fishing.

she leaves the handcuffs on.
but i would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
it is none of your concern.
where ya headed?
you are the quizno's.
downsizing?
pretty cool, right?
there is a lot of princesses out there.
you know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
c'mon, do not be such a right-sider.
no!
and i like to pack heavy.
i was just following orders!
all right.

what was the 9th place prize again?
that is totally inappropriate.
hey, can i play?
has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
then we meet at the denny's... ...and then we compare notes.
ah to be in your shoes.
to get some ice cream for everybody.
what was that?
do you really mean that?
no.
sex contracts exist!
i can not stand the fact that jeb is a pot farmer.
jim, do not take this the wrong way.
michael... i promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over.
that is not funny, i love my employees, even thought i hit one of you with my car.
you good?
no, impish or admirable.
that is impossible.
you are not reacting at all as i had hoped.
oh yeah?
that has pejorative connotation.
can you not?
anything here?
where is my steeaaak?
it is a hollowed out sponge... ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper.
trees!
what makes you think you would be an effective paper salesman?
you did not even go to college.
go home, toby.
what a game.
tell you what.
pam wishes.
and that your glasses make you look ugly.
gosh, mommy feels like taking a jog.
wow!
not really!
pam, could you put jan on, please?
what is that meaningful look?
so you just rat me out?
okay.
so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
as much as i might want to.
um, i just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I am sorry.
listen up.
let me get this clear!
no!
that looked like it was going to be good.
you could not handle my undivided attention.
here is the ring.

i respond to strong leadership.
the mayor.

here is your coffee!
you excited?
if... could do it?
fine, i took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.
okay?
i still would have seen it, but that is not... the point.
that is how we do it in the paper biz.
i already made an appointment... with your secretary.
ryan, enough with the texting machine.
abso-fruit-ly.
no.
and action... lights, camera, action.
kelly, you are hindu, so you believe in buddha.
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?

good.
hey, kelly.
dunder mifflin.
the temp.
okay, I am going to wrap it up here.
are we ready?
you people.
i am the plant.

and mostly i feel that michael would approve.
i mean i have to play caleb crawdad, handsome playboy.
let him get his own.
there is only a survival guide.
sounds good.
la telefona.
it is about adapting to the circumstances.
after that, we have a difficult conversation.
god has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in new york tonight.
you know what?
avrile lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
harry potter world is supposed to be faaantastic!
I am in an identical situation.

i got it made in the shade.
ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.
jim, could you come in here please?
your instinct.
come on.
let me ask you something.
no sign of the sign being moved.
although i may have to break it tonight when helene and i tell pam over dinner.
n-nothing you need to know the details of.
dwight, there is no way i can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
i just... i feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
i do not want to appear ungrateful for everything sabre's doing for us.
i have all the time in the world.
carol is one smart cookie.
do you know what I am referring to?
how you doing?
yes i do.

please, i am your inferior and I am asking you this favor.
there is no fire.

thank you, dwight.
but you know what?
unfortunately i spoke to oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
the steamtown mall.
but she is in the hospital, she is fine, recovering nicely.
yeah.
and i am obviously the joker.
cindy!
well, do you think i should describe our filing system?
i can not.
just, i want you to just forget about him, ok?
listen, dwight.
willing to prove himself now.
i have a recurring nightmare that I have been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury.
okay, you can stop.
the precious heart.
no!
he shot himself in the head.
stop the bus, okay?
what is he doing in there?
we can try.

two to three hours... come up with a statement in the next hour....
okay, it is football cream.
I am okay.
this is not your fight.
yes!
apollo creed.
kind of sorta an oaky afterbirth.
okay.
move out.
at a gas station?
I have seen that movie half a dozen times, and i still do not know who the real spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
I am so, so sorry.
so, take it away, toby!
that was your idea.
creamy skin.
do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
just need to learn how to swim.
toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special.
today I am headed to philadelphia for the annual northeastern office supply convention.
shake on it?
okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us?
uh, well, honestly ed, i really do not want to be up there right now.
let us do it to it!
of course not.
i would have been chief of surgery... or a cowboy.
i am talking about freedom, about choice.
you are kidding me.
.
and i was five, five years old.
yeah... i could.
everyone, okay?
how would that help creed?
you did not get the joke.
crazy world.
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.
but she did.
it is not a doomsday device, gosh.
I have been trying to keep it going.
it will be fine, i just...wish people were going to be drunk.
for what, the art?
you could throw it all day long.
how do you do it?
i mean, we have already put-together chairs.
do not get too excited, that is out of 20.  right this way.
that is what I am talking about.
i just saved your life.
where do you go?
what is up?
what is the scuttlebutt?

alone but together.
well, uh, another option.
that is how we buy them actually.
yeah.
do not!
now.

yeah, well I am calling the ungrateful bi-atch hotline!
why are you dressed like that?
all of you feel like my family.
i am not just saying that.
my emergency contact is todd packer.
do you think you can handle it?
pam!
you can love a boss like you do a father.
it is about michael.
that guy-remember?
where was my oprah moment?
jim!
what is this about?
i shouted many things!
do you want me to?
great equalizer.
so, what have we learned?
this is more professional.
well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me.
so... and they do, your parents, love you very much.
I am on web m.d.
that is not smart.
I have got a better angle on pam.
you can toss them.
okay.
i need to find ways to push meredith to the bottom.
wow.
what?
...where did you get that information.
i do not know how george bush did it when colin powell left, and if utica thinks that they are going to poach stanley, they have another thing coming.
I am not mad.
in, your, face!
just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want.
change your mind, come back up.
ah, i have to get back to work.
not now.
phyllis is my old maid.

I am asking each of you to lose five pounds.
there he is.
who is playing with the button?
very messy.
oh yeah.
arigatou gozaimashita.
and if we do not get this, if we do not nail it, we are going to lose the whole triumph of the moment.
that is what jim and dwight thought.
i am meeting my new boss, nellie bertram, head of special projects.
i am making a citizen's arrest.
it is time.
oh, okay.
we are all in this together.

okay.
i can mash that up in my head right now.
i use my little girl voice.
everybody enjoying their meal?
so is this for a movie that you are writing?
so, should we go call jim and tell him to go screw himself?
oh, hey karate kid.
both of them.
different guy.
here is what i was thinking.
maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
i am a paper salesman, this is humiliating.
not a giant net.
let us go, come on.
oh-oh.
so, jim is actually my friend.
because I am only going to say this once.
if i ever start acting like that weenie gabe i want you to take that gun, and i want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I am dead.
no.
i can not figure it out.
come on people.
i would look like an idiot.
man, i worked hard.
just run!
I am just tired.
let us get to work.
hey pam, all this stuff with kevin... um, it is pretty scary.

ed truck.
sorry, thought i heard somebody coming in.
that is all yours.
let us keep it moving on.

you should see the other guy.
you have got to be -ing kidding me.
jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
why are you playing the national anthem?
fire hazard.
nothing.
well, I am not done yet.
oops.
... how much?
you know what?
well, you are pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
oh.
and jim!
erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night.
people are tolerant!
let us take a couple of nights and stay here and think about aunt shirley's offer.
well, that is a relief.
that is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
ah.
erin, do we have the journal?
one of my employees is undergoing a crisis and i wish for just once you would take my side on this.
ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait.
are you okay with being called jim?
wow, elephant in the room.
yeah- oh!
no.
get out of here.
arrest that man!
but here is the thing: yes, we can.

oh really?
for real.
that should not have been in there.
damn it.
oh.
mmhmm, bravo!
you know what?
nah, it is not.
your meeting.
it is a real shame, because studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos.
our collective dunder mifflin...family baby.
mmm.
because of him, the british left india, and then he became an actor like ronald reagan.
that does not mean anything, those are just words.
i was eventually going to get around to my dream!
i do not want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
right?
i see what you are doing.

but, I am, I am not like wham-bam.
colorado specialty, rocky mountain oysters.
where is he, pam?
what part of "i need to pee" do you not understand?
why did not you just say that, pam?
why do not you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.
he is like a manatee.
this office is cursed.
business.
um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
what is a dis... what is that?
okay.
oh, okay.
no.
and your ebony tower.
believe me, i have tried.
well, sure, playing the field is great, do not get me wrong, but there is more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
and the character "mikanos", is just a little added flava.
no!
i want to get personal and i want you all to really open up.
this is where paper comes from.
yes, it is.
we did not see any.
oh, it smells good in here.
uh-huh.

a loyal, but bungling apostle.
I am sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
dwight.

it is not just a human problem.
in your perfect would, what would make this building awesome?
wait.
i am cool.
so what is the deal?
hah!
that is ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
they are just numbers and boring and blech.
do you need some music, or...?
those of you who wish to join me, that is great.
sits.
thank you, ryan.
threat neutralized.
at home?
can i trust jim?
hello.

tokyo?
i knew that.
ah!
he was not so handsome.
red cross, you know, racket.
my treat.
that is fantastic.
which is, of course... yes, good abbreviating, jim.
cancel it.
everybody told me that you were not interested.
that is it!
so sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we are at corporate.
phillip, if you are hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I am dead.
one more... question.
stuff happens, right?
it is going to be our treat, please?
da  na na na na!!
you have just never seen it.
i can not get out of it!
very comedically humorous jim.
truth be told, i never thought that this was how it was going to end.
michael!

and now, by show of applause, we will crown this year's hay king.
why would they all be...?
wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
oh it is all good, it is all good.
hey!
dwight, just, just leave them alone please.
i will give you that.
and then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling.
no wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
we got it.
i can not go through with this.
you said you did not know how to say it.
and we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place.
yesterday, i was dispatched to jim and pam's house to find pam's ipod.
breeding?
okay, I will have to bring in my bow staff.
it is how they wrestle in a blow-up suit...  that will tell me all i need to know  or how sumo... david!
two ladies at once.
there he is!
how did you know i was up here?
I am going to give him something to drink.
ah!
no.
i do not understand when you all talk at the same time.
especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first valentine's day since holly, so i think that i am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
we will, see you when you get out.
aaaaaaaa!
angela?
i want you to take me down.
i am.
they are way too focused on work.
euughhaEUR  pathetic, huh?
fire him.
how nice for you.
we will haggle about money, and then i will back down, and then i will not talk to her until this whole cynthia thing has blown over.
no.
come on!
that is so spicy.
we shall see.
you are lying right now.
no,  i do not know.
that is a ridiculous question.
"for a good time, call michael scott"?
but it talked about the actual course.
where were you this morning?
father, dressed in white, pulls me forward.
the product... the progidal... my son returns.
you all owe me one.
have a seat.
owner of a 1600-acre beet farm?
he is a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin.
we love it here.
okay.
my blockbuster stock is down.
excellent.
it is my sumo suit.
what?
chair, lamp, plant, table leg, jim's leg.
okay.
they are mean, but they are incisive.
the first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
there are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work.
first team back is the winner.
any questions?
return it!
she was engaged to an animal.
back and forth.
just let the swelling go down.
oh.
i have it too.
like having sex with jan- look, i am not a gazillionaire.
okay, guys, guys, guys.
kill mose before he kills you.
i have a small problem.
it is not relatable.
well, you said i looked thin, so what does... does that mean I am like thin weird or thin handsome or... yes, well, of course.
hey!
way to go!
no, michael!
i love ohio.
let us see how she does.
i have to have an emergency crown put in.
no, no, no, no.
i want my baby back, baby back, baby back chili's baby back ribs... woo, well, this brings us to january  truth or dare?
raise your hands if you like to buy things.
oh, my god!
dweedle dee and dweedle dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave.

a boss is like a teacher.
time thief!
hi.

why are we here?
let me just explain.
oh.
it was not clear on the google image search.
there were only two options.
oh heyyy.
hey, hey, hey.
divorce.
they feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.
watch and learn.
hello.
thank you.
you guys should use a hand truck.
ok.  well, if it is just going to be one, i will think of a different joke.
and right now it is all rat and no tat.
we will go at lunch.
i-i have been steeped in anticipation.
this is going to be perfect, ok?
each tribe will have a leader that i will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking.
the schrute-bernard-lapin-vance...stanley paper company.
uh huh.
we make a poster that says "happy opposite day!" and she sees it on the way out... nah, that is stupid.
not now.
well i guess... you could come and stay at my condo.
I am sorry.
a good life.
not my problem.
god.
i can not shop at a fancy norwegian boutique.
oh, shoot.
good.
andy brought some salmon.
i know you like their earrings.
can you do that?
uh, ugh, ohhhh... i want michael to take me... choo choo choo choo choo choo... vietnam sounds.
really?
i would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
nah.
standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler.
and it is not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case.
thank you.
oh, god.
i got next, i got next up.
the pack is back!
we are like peanut butter and jelly, do not you think?
for recording.
he went over my head.
watch this.
what you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that is been said is untrue, including "stanley is having an affair." it is like the end of spartacus.
hey... no it is not.
cool, cool, cool.
and, well, jim.
michael has something to tell you.
yes, but these are employees, sir.
ok.  well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.
they are just, it is not...  yes, i shaved above my neck.
ahh, damn this chicken is good.
you can not outrun your problems.
maybe have lunch together?
we did not win.
you call it.
allow me.
i do not know.
so, catch-22.
i can do that.
whoo kay.
why does she do that?
another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
attention everyone!
careful.
give  them some chairs.
hold on, hold on.
you said that?
you did.
hey!
they hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.
is he going to offer you the manager's job?
does the tiger fire the monkey?
get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
yes, yes, yes.
no!
great.
get whatever you want.
dwight?
it is super perfect.
laying a base... yeah... oh, there he is.
what is the matter with... me?
yes, i do!
oh, so this is what every day would be like if you had not left india.
you can not have someone murdered.
...they found the castle, michael.
contractually we are obligated to have sex.
no it is not.
she can not find those little colored paper clips that i like so much.
a gah-no.
i am trying to bring team spirit.
so is there a guy or, uh, a person.
this is gotcha journalism.
I am going to a meeting.
and sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.
number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it.
january mr. of'malley.
I am sorry.
we can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
what if we can not do it- hey, shut up.
hmm.
so I will get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the tv, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I am ready for bed!
no, no.
i can drive a taxi.
but, i think i want to do those things myself.
I am  against violence in the workplace.
in an election year.
what does it look like?
gabe, it is dwight again.
mmm hmm.
would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?
okay.
michael scott.
he just, he is always, he is always talking about people behind their backs to me.
no, no, no.
yep.
somebody just walked in.
its just, i do not think the cartoons are very funny.
wait a second, do people often say they are going on sales calls and then go someplace else?
they had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.
because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, darryl?
so long.
come on!
when they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that i had a good idea.
so - see you later.
that was so kind of you.
no, god, please no!
if you hit another horse, you have dug to far.
good morning erin.
and there is a special secret prize for the winner!
i need to see if they are dilated.
come on.
thirst.
angela!
all right.
no.
better put on your ski boots!
dwight, it is couples only.
well-where is that bowl?
i will pay you whatever it takes.
hi santa.
thought I would go casual today.
three- hello everyone!
i was talking to myself.
oh wow.
if you like james franco, we really should watch rise of the planet of the apes.
in every beat of my heart, we got something going on.
I am thirsty.
write legibly people.
although, i can not say i was a big fan of  'bowling for columbine', because i thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'kingpin'.
we have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
oh.
let us go, c'mon.
okay, get out of here.
now!
no.
i do, i have to go.
it is the european cut.
i do not particularly get into this.
you know what i just wanted to remind you about the game today.
just do not say no.
do not blow it.
god, I am going to have to work with them forever, are not i?
oh, right.
is it safe that park that in my driveway.
could i stay in your room tonight?
hey you know what?
argh.
no.
that is why i always start with a gun, because you can not top it, you just can not.
it is angela!
I am not going to bump.
when i was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him.
when i was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how i was always able to distract others in class.
"la la la la la la la la la la!" what does that mean?
look, i am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you.
hey, hey jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.
rolph, please.
hello?
why is she trying to take stanley from us?
so she is passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog... and the neighbors blamed january it is like, you know, the dog should not have been outside in the first place.
big day.
ho-ho.
actually i had two fish stick sandwiches.
do not say that.
and how did you get my resume?
take off your shoes.
well... i guess we papered over that pretty nicely.
fine!
I am the mistress?
she is just a great human fighter pilot.
deal with it.
and we all got misled.
what is up my brotha?
no rest for the sick.
i think it is very apparent.
that is her?
so that is going to be my donation to you.
hello.
sure.
no.
and they said they could not guarantee it if there is downsizing, okay?
come on man, that is disgusting dwight!
pow!
anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and i never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one.
let us go!
this order form.
oh, so an aquarium.
that is our theme.
i have not decided yet.
michael ... oh... poor little fella.
put these on.
absolutely.
amazing, is not it.
unless he comes back as pretend dwight.
oh no.
yeah sure, jim could go see her.
the year before that, i also came as monica lewinsky.
god, angela, why is that always my responsibility?
you can... okay, i think we are good.
it is syracuse money.
if you ask me, he caused the panic.
and i thought, you know, maybe i deserve this.
in case you remember, i was defending my honor... like a samurai.
introduce yourself.
ballers only.
i did not say that to make you feel good.
he does not know anything, and neither do you.
where?
she sent me an email this morning.
smaller.
jan, i uh want to... can i help you?
what?
hey hey hey hey.
has anyone seen an envelope with bruce springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes?
two fifteenths.
let the bedbugs bite!
he drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the.. how much longer is this going to take?
and it always works.
darryl is mista ra-jahs.
"you need to do something about your coffee breath"- ok. shut up, shut up, shut up, dwight, ok. i do not think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
here we go, fourth time's a charm.
for accounting, a brand new printer.
oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry." meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me.
here is toby from human resources.
are we cool?
um hmm.
i mean, I have rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh... i know.
michael, can i talk to you, please?
hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs?
look sharp!
hey.
not like you new yawkers.
wow your hair is really thinning.
thank you.
my god, oscar.
ah!
who is kafkaesque?
belsnickel is here!
i was in the mall, and i saw that, and i thought it had your name written all over it.
it is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.
now I have got to go meet angela.
just someone come, ok?
do you understand?
$200.
you know what else?
come on, let us go.
or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
but i just... just want to keep it within reason.
hello ladies, how is my shower going?
and unless somebody taught mose sex, that baby is mine.
that suit is amazing.
wha-   starbucks gift card.
some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat.
you can walk, right?
maybe next year.
what the hell is that?
what is the square footage?
you know who the vandal is.
it is not a dress code.
yes.
believe me, i have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
well, you are wearing it at the office.
about talking to the press?
yes, um, jim.
from the downsizing.
mose, bags!
thanks for your help.
oh, pam please behave.
all right!
it is your funeral.
you are not helping, trevor!
okay.
this party has to really rock.
the warmth will lure people inside.
you might want to use him to sort of get that orville redenbacher dynamic going.
hey.
i have an idea.
i got it on a website, that is not important.
last time i was down there, i noticed they would put up a couple of hoops, and i play basketball every weekend.
write it down.
it is only twenty-five bucks.
oh god!
i love this car.
so I am going to need to train a replacement.
your turn, stanley.
just- jim, could you fetch me some ice chips?
oh, just so you know, it is not me, it is you.
and, you learned something.
click on guest list.
what is up-dog?
ok... is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
yes well... stanley was on your group date?
ok. thank you, stanley.
I am not overwhelmed, pam.
uh huh.
you would be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out... yeah.
and a chihuahua.
i order you to give me that file.
it is for a good because.
that was totally legitimate.
it is a relief.
what did you just thought?
stop it!
no.
what?
oh, so wait a minute, you are going to time me every time i yawn?
what are you doing?
it is perfect.
do not worry about it.
it is okay, if you did.
when you know, you just know.
you will not.
what?
that is right now.
I am going to give it a ohh!
i wonder what is inside.
there is a hose out back.
why do not you run yourself out there and tell them?
my dream was in the right place.
you knock and then you wait for the all clear.
go around, start doing the heimlich.
do you think that this is a game?
you have to eat it!
icing on the cake.
high fives!
you know what, we will postpone this party until then.
thank god.
oh, man.
he is not.
um, i got some photos from costa rica if you want to see them?
dwight, i asked him.
keep it going.
he is a high school baseball coach.
darryl moved it.
pfft, "athlead"?
you got a lot of anger under there buddy.
we are looking for a man.
sorry, my meeting ran late.
what did i say?
so i said, "pop a claritin, and i will spot you the seventy bucks," and she is like "i do not like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication."  and I am like, "well you are really not going to like what i slipped in your drink last night." and she is like, "what the hell are you talking about?" and I am like, "I am kidding.
could you put these on the board?
i took the liberty of making a list of everyone who did not follow you in here.
yes, i do not... i know, i know.
it is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.
this is amazing!
well, they can not all be winners.
no.
do not you garbage?
you know what?
that way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar, she can see it.
see, this is good, we are learning and we are figuring some stuff out.
domo arigato, mr. scott-of.
keep it.
i hate it.
how do i describe it?
no, you are.
maybe it was not so mutual after all.
jump over the camera!
come on.
yeah, they are like an i-pod only they are better because they are chunkier and more solid.
they have a tcby booth.
oh please.
hey, what are you guys doing in here?
get me!
right now!
no, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
wait.
use to have two cars, traded  them in, now we are down to one.
fine.
pump it up!
creed!
there are basically two schools of thought-- bears do not-- what is going on-- what are you doing?!
i did not find a perfect moment, because i think that today was just about just having today.
all right?
does anyone here have fermented mare's milk?
I would think about it.
i can not beat rabies.
i love you, new york!
why do not i tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?
oscar, you brought your speedo, i assume?
so... no... just leave me alone.
do not answer that.
you need to pack up your things and go.
thank dylan's mom.
eat!
therefore, technically, she is caucasian.
this is about guts.
i specifically remember there were a lot of other people i thought should be considered.
that is silly.
the shrutes have their own traditions.
god.
are you sure?
hey, come on!
oh, how are you?
... schrute.
ah, roy's accepting.
how do i become a manger at sabre?
listen, michael - about what happened earlier.
but is it the best management?
I am very flattered.
what?
i will answer your question with a question.
what do you know about management, dwight?
what are you going to do?
obviously george clooney.
forty... I am in my forties.
it may seem like a good idea, but it is not.
uh... no.
michael!
what are you doing here?
phyllis, you are not... phyllis, no.
thank you for your time i look forward to getting your calls.
that is called card stock.
except you kevin, they stay on.
this is not a toy.
okay.
was it the cleavage?
merry christmas!
just make that copy okay?
what else?
it is really happening.
well, what should i do?
let us rock some stuff here, okay?
okay.
two of their branches have closed within the last year.
we can do this.
she will "do" you.
ghaaa!
all right.
my ideals at a party?
phyllis, what are you doing?
you think they have copiers?
i do.
hurt petulant jesus.
break's over!
you drove over that.
uggggh!
it smells like chicken soup.
</i> i am sorry that i have to do this... I am so sorry.
goodbye toby!
guilty.
thanks.
i did not can i have a ride home?
yeah, it is... freaking cold out here.
oh.
if we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
that sounds good.
two of my favorite joke areas combined.
look, the point is, i am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I am sure stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
we will have to talk- just amongst ourselves.
pam, you are trustworthy- and a woman- and i want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.
yes!
any one else?
no... what happened?
you are an idiot.
arriba!
i saved jim's life with a can of pepper spray i had velcroed under my desk.
i have no choice but to pick the hay king myself.
i feel... I am sorry i caused that thing.
no, no, no!
does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?
yes.
you are not going to lose them.
yes.
michael.
well, it is not ideal but you have to give me some credit because i made it into a word.
he is not the guy with the cheeks.
you give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would.
did you ever think of this?
the sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about  2 of the clock in the afternoon.
that is not the point.
sound good?
we are selling success.
as has michael and as has holly.
i think they were stolen.
apparently, they got attached to the duck and did not want to see it killed.
right?
it is a scary... it is a... it is a predicament, and it is something that each and every one of us has to think about.
but the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is january but the brain needs a heart, and that is me again.
this is... emotionally magnificent.
dwight is... dwight looks like spock to me.
and as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in schrute farms.
i got a big box how 'bout you?
do you like it?
this is a paper company, people!
yes.
alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
well, you did not, because i know where ya hid the diamonds.
well who needs new york?
it is sad, though, because i had a great summer.
pam, can you come in here, please?
ok. thank you.
be my mo manley.
um, couple of months ago, dwight tried to go behind my back with jan and get my job and i am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
no, michael!
because, I am not-I am not... I am not going to be in town.
could i get some more pickles?
I am taking him out to lunch because i can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
bravo, watson.
i heal them.
well, it is nice for you.
excellent!
one, two, three.
oh, hey guys.
I am sick of the little disapproving head shakes.
esther ruger.
this- no, jim.
we were not expecting you!
hey, idiot.
alright!
hmm?
the rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.
I am going to pull a date out of the air right now.
roasted.
uh, let us just decide and agree upon one.
what?
that guy was weird.
seats have been assigned.
give it a little test drive, what do you say?
do you love me or not?
yeah, saving you from animal planet jack over there.
no thank you.
why?
yes.
so what is your crazy business pipe dream?
you are the one.
i know... what?
awesome!
well, I am looking forward to meeting terri.
well, they are good snacks.
jim is in charge of stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line-green for money-sales, get it?
you will look like a mafia don.
like the witness protection program.
what do you mean?
plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
no, it is going in a different direction then the other wires.
we... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
salesman of northeastern pennsylvania, i ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
that was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul.
urine.
well you thought wrong.
that is weekend at bernie's.
sales.
if i had been jfk, i would have seen all three gunmen.
i want you to watch this.
that is because you are incapable of doing it because you do not know how.
we will all starve.
I am sorry.
jim got the bigger half.
mr. bill.
good.
only really good friends show up early.
come on everybody!
god.
it is time to go out on a sale!
it is miraculous the effect that i will have on their lives.
do you ever watch battlestar galactica?
okay?
damn rooster did not crow.
take a chill pill.
jim may i have a moment with pam please.
pam.
no.
you have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth.
look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon.
what sort of movie would rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections?
anybody?
and i am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.
i think that is pretty interesting.
you just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser.
!?!
yes you did.
the best i can do one month for every year you have been here.
i did.
belsnickel cares not about this-off with you!
at this time, we are issuing a full recall of all sabre gh400 printers.
it is okay.
I am sure whatever you did it was not your fault.
want to see it?
god.
I am talking about... hmmm.
yes.
i did not feel much when i held astrid, but i got a good feeling from holly.
i need my assistant to the regional manager.
stop it, please.
i do not know how she dealt with that as long as she did.
that is disgusting.
happy to do it.
we will take one more.
then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let us face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet.
i did not order a stripper.
yeah.
okay, you know what?
is not that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
michael?
there are other choices, there is information that we - are you kidding me?
yes.
no, you said something, did not you?
they were.
oh, jim.
beat it.
is that what we are learning in business school?
jan, this program is going to change people's lives.
that will not go over well.
blackula!
you are coming, and that is an order.
thank you, sensei.
I am going to find gabe, tell him what jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
ok. all right.
good luck against conn college, alright?
it works.
that was a really sucky thing to do.
come in.
pam, I am obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
i will not.
oh wait.
dwight, get the door.
why do not you get over lunch, oscar?
well... i do not... let us just not talk about it, okay?
i love that song.
no!
do not invite any zombies to a celebration of diwali.
yeah.
well it is a little chillier than i had thought, so i have fashioned my hat back into my pants.
exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.
that is because this baby is of superior intelligence.
stanley, we are havin a little... we are havin a little brainstorm session... ...good, this is good.
we are all a family, right?
i have lots of work... oh, oh check this out.
or the day after that.
not for me, for my children.
this is my sale, michael!
this is a very special story, it is called struwwelpeter, by heinrich hoffman from 1864.  the great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs-- are you listening, sasha?
they are all mine.
i emerge victorious!
I am sorry.
science fiction convention, nope.
are you sure?
or if we box.
i did not want to go back to the annex because that is where holly worked whom i loved.
thank you so much.
he says, "no!" boom!
we were joking around.
that he could turn jan against me?
take a sip of that.
he sure left in a hurry.
well then... hey you know what then let us just talk.
i mean have this kind of party.
oh!
wow.
quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure.
why are you?
but that is what you do when things die.
how you doing?
get your foot behind the yellow line.
no we do not!
you want a big bowl of ice cream.
oh god, that is a terrible idea.
get out jim.
meredith has an e-vite from jim.
i wanted to be surprised.
surprise!

sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon.
you are the weakest link.

you will be hearing from us shortly, mr. schrute, and i think you are going to like the call you are going to receive.
deserve  protection from local pervs.
when my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.

so... you know, it is really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
andy, you are bin laden.
old fashioned meet market -- -- i do not think it is.

jim!
to give you a reference point.
r-e-s-p-svee-t. find out what it means to me.
i hate the fact that we have to do this together.
what i respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how antz was just a rip-off of a bug's life, he stayed true to his films.
very smart.
i am sorry.
I will be baaaaack!
these covers are totally indestructible.
radisson?
gracias.
what is the world's largest ocean?
it is going to be over before you know it.
i am going to zone you out for the rest of today.
but listen to me, you can not talk to me that way in this office, you just can not.
and i feel like i need to go to nashua and get closure.
rapport!
you know what?
hey, hey, hey, hey!
stop it, get out!
affirmative.
we have it on tape, so... i was going to put that in my message, toby.
charles, you got my back on this?
you are crap.

i do not think you are doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
saved it.

do not be scared of you are night in heaven-" yeah.
your mother is dying.

untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys.
here too.
dwight schrute, I am a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called dunder mifflin.
yaaaaa!
dunder mifflin, we supply your office paper.
that is my line!
or, as i like to call it, the whorehouse.
my dad cheated a lot but i never busted him on it.
right?
you are fired!
i do okay.
everybody, it is my turn now, okay?
almost heaven... in german!
but here is the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage.
is that the matsuhashi b-400?
i do not know, it is just... i do not know, just makes you kind of feel good.
dwight is my king up my sleeve.
ahhhhhh!
because I am going crazy.
look at you!
calm down.
excuse me, boob enhancement.
thanks for coming.
us old timers need to stick together.
blood, urine, or semen.
you have the floor, ryan.
they taste so good in my mouth.
are there any bloggers around?
somebody really put a lot of work into that.
yep.
no do it, do it.
but you are the best.
the meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor.
just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check.
I am very fast.
i do not get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids.
for you, job well done.
they reminded me of kindergarten.
you are going to get seasick if you keep reading in here.
that is it.
here we go.
I am going to frame mine.
i do not have my wallet and i was going to try to dine and dash and that was stupid and i realize i can not do that to you fine people.
just a ride home?
i do not know how you do it.
very well!
i do, too.
oh, blue blast.
how is it going?
broken nose!
what?
you, kelly and creed, kevin, they believe in you.
geesh, dwight!
okay!
no.
yeah.
ok,  what does this look like to you stanley?!
hey, pam, I am assistant regional manager, and i can take care of him.
you know what?
you ever done this?
just... try to be cool.
creepy guy who is abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
come on.
ok, do me.
turned out fine for me.
oh my god  oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey  wait, wait!
go puck yourself!
well... i do not know if that is a good idea.
anal fissures?
it is all yours.
it was like, "oh, ed truck is walking toward us.
the ones that make you pull the car over and go, "wow, i need this beet right now."  those are the money beets.
yep?
um... that is what i was thinking, with the farm, so... you getting to wherever I am going to put my thing.
people who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves!
it is a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet?
i happen to have been working a very long day.
he, well...  tell you about toby later, he is awful.
it is so bad ass.
I have already set the bar really high.
you understand.
there is a man's life at stake here.
you click on that first, then a whole new-not, no, no, no!
hmm.
you hit register-- updates are ready.
and it was not hilarious.
smells pretty bad, does not it?
we need to find out what is blocking you.
uh, yes, I am in charge.
there is no stanley tree.
oh my god!
all right.
that is highway robbery.
this is meredith palmer- do not!
discussed movies.
it will be a bonding experience.
i just might be his father.
we are often compared to the guardian angels, but we could not be more different from them.
that is... you know what.
and bear in mind that i would never actually ask you to go camping.
and then it is like all regret.
we come fully equipped with a restroom.
thanks.
come on, no, no, no.
we were just at different places in our lives.
what about when jan said the branch was closing?
kevin malone, you are next.
and finally, pam beesly.
well you tried.
this is a store bought-camera.
oh!
I am not answering that.
hey uh, question for you.
what?
no, it is not.
feelin' hot, hot, hot!
give me the phone.
so, i have a <i>perfect</i> ice-breaker if i ever meet terry hatcher.
well, this year's going to be different.
just, uh, she did not want it to continue for some reason.
the choice is yours.
we should wear them tomorrow to work, it will be hysterical.
because if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell.
is that what it said?
i need to speak to your scranton-area bureau chief?
by any means necessary?
hey, karen, want to get t-together later and have sexual intercourse because you are my girlfriend?
your fictitious name?
did you also know that china has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal.
when i was asking about the leads.
i got her!
leave him.
that is my favorite!
are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
a hostess apple pie!
you know what?
I am the owner.
has anyone checked how dilated she is?
...ish.
okay?
why... are you here?
it is cute, but it is... it is empty, you know?
i released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily.
you have to pick up after them.
you do not even care about nationals.
nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years.
oh my god, mom, i got to go.
i know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what?
i am not going to tell you anything.
i thought i was helping you.
and i think you owe me this.
look at that.
does everybody want a raise?
give me the phone.
the only person he fooled was kevin.
try it on.
any news on the "p" situation?
why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
oh yeah, something happened, jim.
here...  okay!
ahhh!!
if baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then i can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm.
i was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
it would have fit if he had given me another minute.
skeevy little perv.
oh no, it is broken.
he is making her sell to him.
from me, big time.
yes.
i am actually great with old women.
if you let me run it.
oh god.
wow, you are huge!
that is- no, no- it is not about numbers, pam.
great boy.
what do i have to live for?
just ugly enough to have deniability.
here is how things work here: my job is to make the office fun.
okay, that is it.
maybe he is going to church.
look i just want you and i to hang out so, you know.
hey!
assistant to  the regional manager.
i happen to think the old ways of doing business are better.
you will probably just take it out on your kid.
i am going to be your new boss.
i come in here to release frustration.
danger.
do you want the raise or what?
do you understand what we are about to do?
I am good.
you can not see.
it is christmas toby.
you can not, i have a thing tonight.
mega-desk.
the guys at the papermill-- the guys at the papermill-- no no no!
fine.
checked with them.
so which way are you leaning?
I am really scared.
i was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
yes!
but you know what?
pssht.
do not make fun... you are making fun of me.
this is pam beesly,  receptionist extraordinaire.
I will do it without you, but you will regret this.
to jump start a car, first pop the hood.
i used to sit right here.
when i wanted to see stomp, and you wanted to see wicked, what did we see?
you do a hundred jumping jacks.
knight rider.
and then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock!
I am sorry, it... why is it okay for stanley to cheat or for phyllis to cheat... on her diet!
my horn can pierce the sky.
and if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.
heeeeeere's santa!
stevie wonder is married.
you know what?
no, no, no, no.
i want you to stop what you are doing right now.
there you are.
you are back.
oh, yeah.
gin.
i think i got this.
okay.
shh.
nnnnn-dink!
we resolved a lot today, everybody.
yes, thank you.
what do you say?
i never touch a pregnant woman.
angela.
please.
distractions are good!
this looks delicious.
... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me.
um, what about you?
ah!
you are always working hard.
you are not into her?
poor richard's number seven?
how did you all find each other?
what?
just tell them, please.
there he is!
mm, good stuff.
yes i am.
uh, it is equal.
what I am offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
i am a huge woody allen fan.
and pancakes?
a bunch of  them.
got it, dave.
I am michael scott.
well, toby, if by me you are inferring that i have b.of., then i would say that is a very poor choice of words.
come on down here.
okay, you heard something.
ok, ryan.
well I am looking at a photo, right now.
apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now.
what does this mean?
i need a soup spoon.
or a toga, toga- toga!
just let us think.
can you send dwight in here?
and i turned it down.
god, you are so insensitive.
fine, it is not even worth it.
excellent.
frank!
and you two only met once before the wedding night?
a little.
leave me al- saving him!
i just said it.
if you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink.
you should not be apologizing to packer.
okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay.
it saves the company a fortune.
okay.
you remembered.
they did this up in albany... and they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so... well, I am their boss, so i feel like... anybody want any coffee or... women in the workplace... yeah, translation "i have been banned from my own conference room so that jan can talk in secret to all the girls." oh!
let us put a pin in it for now.
want to come over friday?
I am improvising, so just try to keep up.
six percent, i know my worth.
that is all.
it is part of the sales experience.
unless he has a shiv, in which case it would not be a fair fight.
do not hit the fence.
okay.
hold it!
they should not televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
why is she marrying andy?
we had some laughs.
love you.
that is because you are a preppy freak, you are the office pariah, and nobody likes you.
traitor!
oh, ok.  why did not you call me?
open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
you know what?
okay, let us get this started.
crazy.
because you do not call them collared people, that is offensive.
we have almost got it.
diversifying.
what are you doing?
i can not get a stripper here.
they stopped making plaques that year.
hey.
how you doing?
everybody on.
names, numbers.
what are you doing?
he changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk.
oh...  oh, my god.
nice try.
dammit.
... is there any news on the leads?
hello.
slander i say!
time to go get my improv on.
here we go, let us sit down.
she is pretty and appears intelligent.
they are not.
you can sleep up top.
you know, i would like to try the luge, through.
your ass is on the line, mister!
dwight!
I will let you in on a little secret: I have been very much looking forward to this moment.
i said that i would leave him alone, but i will not.
i got on that ramp and i thought two hours, two hours to go.
would that be such a bad thing?
so...  that is uh... thank god.
oh man.
i think we have done things a certain way here at dunder mifflin for quite some time, and - ok. i feel very strongly that you can not just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever.
well, it was a thought.
i very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.
if you can hear me, I would like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you.
so that just leaves dwight and jim.
time off for good behavior!
carol and i split up.
everybody look away.
i love you.
little sugar rush.
those slide moves are just bush league.
I am... excuse me.
so important.
good.
she has a pilates butt.
I have brought with me only the bare essentials.
yeah, okay.
oh, buckle up jim.
you are welcome.
they go, "god we have never worked in a place like this before.
do you know how to use it?
ty, i would like you to crunch those numbers again.
i told her i did not know whether you would want to do it... because you have always been so loyal to me.
please get that off the floor.
oh, we are playing phone tag.
clams, snails... it is real slippery out here.
that is a very nice way of putting it, oscar.
there is an emergency in the warehouse.
hey, justin!
now the chef special sounded good.
so I am thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live.
pam, can you come in here for a sec.
oh, hey, I will take a coffee.
oh, you know what else?
kind of an idiot.
this group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great.
what the?
i got floor.
well, jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
...danny glover.
i had a tickle in my throat.
well, whatever.
pudge has driven the forklift.
no.
it is a town car.
yes, your corner.
no no, no, wait, wait, wait  permission to join the validity committee.
i think lozenge was the one who installed it.
being the boss is also about image.
the best paper company in the whole wide world.
the it tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
i sent it to you at...  <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="84d4e5e7efe1f6c4c0f1eae0e1f6c9ede2e2e8edeaaae7ebe9aa" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection"></a> <i>packaging</i>@dundermifflin.com.
come on clark!
well, you should have a little.
no, I am not.
well, i just want to talk about what happened in there.
there is a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development.
and why did not ya stanley?
i learned that she has read "lonesome dove" three times.
why?
it has a little bit of a weird smell.
good.
let it fly.
the important thing to remember jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise.
i lied to kevin.
i can not.
there needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat.
do not worry pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... your long lovely life.
impossible.
maybe we are the kind of guys who end up with a tractor that is already been rode hard and put away muddy.
I am thinking about throwing it in the garbage.
okay, i do not have time for this.
fine.
hey.
I am here!
okay.
jim, I have given you this information, like, twenty times.
it is reversible, i think.
oh.
it does not matter.
but sometimes twos can be wild.
top 80 percent!
and she is here, like you, to learn from what i have to say.
everybody has to go to the bathroom.
dwight has a joke.
anything.
come on up here you sick bastard.
you have got to pick somebody.
hey jo.
boom!
walk much?
but it is not... going to take... a week or two.
this is me, january  this is me!
okay.
it was <i>so</i> good.
hey michael?
hey, carla?
whoa.
come on, everybody.
you just... you said it.
call you immediately.
oh, it is plenty warm, and i was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
ignore him.
no.
oh my god.
ryan, coffee.
stanley knows what I am talking about.
inspiring words.
thank you.
yeah.
no.
it is six a.m.  and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their dundie nomination certificates.
I will try and think of one.
my biggest fear is turning into him.
stand up, stand up, stand up.
this is angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
yadda yadda, then he is going to ask andy, uh, if he would like to marry angela.
i saw an ad on the sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division.
but i always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.
yes.
unless you want me to.
phyllis, did i or did i not say fruit?
oh, creed... is the old guy over there.
oh, i dunno, they are launching a big new business plan.
that is how your drinking affected me.
i have some bad news.
wow.
and the caption would read: in the dump.
excuse me.
are there two suns?
it is, it is weird, you do not, you just go by the x. the x means times.
andrew bernard, that is my name.
pssh.
wow, this looks uh, terrible.
they are not abandoning the party.
write this down.
you are telling me!
i just remembered, so, I will just ride back with you.
oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp?
it was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people.
jim and i used to clean up at those.
because a motel is dirty and it is sexy.
that is feces.
pam has been with us for...  forever.
dwight.
ungh, this is not looking good pam!
it is always a treat when <i>our</i> paths cross.
oh, i had no idea what a gift this line is." i will get the chair in.
koselli.
do you have a minute?
it is just that you were terrible at your job.
call poison control if you are bit by a spider.
no!
captain jack is a fart face.
the leads that sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet.
i know, grumble, grumble.
we all have a hero in our heart.
ambulances are emergencies only.
I will try brookstone.
yeah.
no, i realize you normally reorder in november, but what I am suggesti... you did what?
we are supposed to use toby.
april 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
here we go.
check your hair!
give it.
no, try me.
hello, this is dwight schrute from the dunder mifflin paper company.
mother- what did we learn this week?
okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.
why do not you tell jim where you were from ages 14 to 15. in juvie.
that is tina fey from saturday night live.
and you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
it started with..  holly flax, marrying me will you be?
like meredith or kevin, i mean, who is going to give kevin an award?
go on.
with really good bacon.
michael is on vacation and he is asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
nice to meet you.
well, i am taking responsibility.
catchphrase: "my horn can pierce the sky".
it is a whole new regime.
guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
let us table that.
jim can leave anytime he wants.
that is - you saw who did this and you did not stop them?
in fact, he is lied about every question.
i destroyed 15 young lives today.
now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer.
jim?
he defecated, aw.
yes, let us get right into the anderson account, shall we?
it is important that this company celebrates its diversity.
I am trying to write something funny here, okay.
after.
mhm hm.
ah!
pam, pam, thank you madam.
many schrutes were born here and many of us end up here.
get that over here.
just tell me it is not totally insane to try one more time.
yeah, you are right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?
do not worry about it.
nope.
these are people who care about you.
holly, i did not mean to do it.
just really grabs your attention.
we are following pam to the supply shelf.
alright.
thank you.
how about, ah, lackawanna county.
wow!
i miss you.
pam, translate.
you!
on the first day.
whoa.
hi.
check that out.
so, what about you, angela?
all right.
never mind.
you know, he is just a normal new york city cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up.
dwight schrute.
i just... it is terrifying.
and he is going to fire me?
woo-hoo!
self taught.
please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence.
i wanted this party to be really special so i sorta went above and beyond.
uh.
hey hey!
i was a hell raiser.
we are doing this because of you.
oh, i feel for you.
thank you.
can you imagine if i was deranged?
that would be exciting.
yeah, something happened.
I am on the phone, please.
oh, god.
okay.
that is not a baby.
i can not use phyllis.
one.
what was that printer we were looking at?
ippi would take you to here.
I am on it.
maybe if you listened a little bit, you would improve.
holly... lujah!
as ranking number three in this office, i am order - you are number four.
lacerated hand here folks.
...i say you will miss our service, and i absolutely guarantee you will come back.
none of your business, jim.
as assistant regional manager... look!
i am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
i know, i know, i know.
or have we forgotten the words of the reverend king.
right there.
wow.
cool.
poor hornet.
come on!
do sad.
thank you.
happy halloween, jerk!
i got a splinter.
and before that, i was of.j.
i came here today because i promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.
no.
in an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager.
captain jack delegates.
we had to let him go.
may i have your attention?
excuse me, everyone!
um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?
"scranton area paper company, dunder mifflin, apologizes to valued client.
whoo!
you know what?
I will show you my id.' she has not come back yet.
thank you.
oh, hey, ebenezer, boink.
alright.
soda.
you are welcome.
temp!
why did you just say he was the boss?
your old condo closing papers.
i could take or leave the perks.
well what am i supposed to do?
i did not say it!
i am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
yes.
we have got smoke!
and that is something toby will never understand.
look at all that sweet blubber.
i forgot to mention.
I will talk to you...  this is going to be hard for me to speak today.
that would be fine.
you sexy thang you." here you go.
uh... uh, i do not know.
did you hear stanley's having an affair?
I am going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
hey, everybody.
a dsi?
you could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet.
that is great.
fine.
god!
the grim reaper is here.
wait, shut up.
people tell me things.
ladies and gentlemen!
I am cool!
michael, i cannot tell you what i was doing there.
ok, buddy." any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.
that was the sick one, right?
but, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side.
it is not even a real snow.
tastes like cigarettes.
cool.
um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?
no it is not.
it is okay, she is cool, she also whistle-blew.
yeah, that gould is a real interesting guy, a gem.
it... for example, every year i get a $100 gas card... can not put a price tag on that.
if i just went away right now, would that be the best gift that i could give you?
yes.
i am kerrigan from starcraft!
and when clients call and you are not smiling they can hear that in your voice.
I am probably closest.
what did you love about it?
that was not what i was not, that was not... no.
um.
but then i got an e-mail from ryan, that he was coming back to town.
no, they are not transferrable just because i handed  them to you.
come on, here we go!
this is a lifelong dream.

ohhhh!
I am just walking around.
she is... we hooked up and... you know, months ago, just once, it is, just stupid.
so what i was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud?
this is just, a lot more of a laxative.
what do you want?
see, do not even need to make contact.
it is just a joke.
I will stall  them.

we need a new plague.
push it!
kgb.
retail consumer habits is...  the only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings.
i am so sorry that phyllis hates you.
no.
we think a lot alike.
and martin has had a bad influence, to think that i gave him the benefit of the doubt.
so roy is actually going to be marrying pam sometime this summer.
when jan and i had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called "survivorman." and, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
the girl in the video we are watching that corporate gave us... darryl banged her!
you do not, you do not know me.
it is not safe.
what did it say?
look I am just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things.
ready to do this?
happy birthday to you.
what is wrong with you?
what are you doing?
but i had to start somewhere.

recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
that marriage would be a sham.
you believe a computer can beat me?
you are kidding.
yes, i have decided to shun andy bernard for the next three years.
this is a surplus.
what if your girlfriend is 55?
all right.
but then dunder-mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there is little evidence of that.
no, that would not- no, you do not have to do that.
do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?
hey, watch it, watch it.
i have a lot of ideas for new directions.
you would not understand.

what did you get tonight?
what uh- wow, you are kidding me!
smart as a whip!
no questions.
and ... okay.

you know?
huu, what do you think?
what... what is happening?
I am not getting dressed.
"i am not going to discuss anything outside of dunder mifflin business, period." okay.
I am like butch cassidy, and michael is like mozart.
i do not try and be anything that I am not.
no, no, no.
so, anybody else?
uh, if they do not bobble, what is the point?
come on.
bloggers are obese.
animal stool.
come on up!
we are not.
tied to my desk.
oh, pam!
i actually wrote a movie.
it is just that i own the coffee shop.
abso-fruit-ly.
why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh?
mmmmm.
louder!
stop it.

i just got back from jamaica.
one minority from this branch is going to get into this program.

i do not know, what do you mean?
let us go.
final responsibility for watermark-gate has been assigned.
you look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
hey gang.
corporate really does not really interfere with me at all.
i wish i could understand you.

I am going to date them one year apart.
jim, do not interfere.
there is no time to explain.
of course.
okay, let us go to hayworth's.
awesome!
okay, you know what?
no, that was- I am just getting into the first act.
just dig.
ouch!
what is the best color?
well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of chili's.
but I am not sure he is a great fit for the office.
look, michael, i know you do not want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, god forbid, then i would need to know in order to take over.
ow, ow, ow.
as a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order.
hey, what is going on here?
all right, uh... me, stan the man, jim, ryan and dwight.
clear out, stat!
i need to stay focused, and i do not have to see you tomorrow or sunday and please do not call me, and we will see how things go on monday.
I am going out on a very important sales call.
i dare you to produce one credible source about this.
i wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in england.
convoys are really fun.
okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction!
may i have your attention please.
i know what angela and the senator look like.
snakes are waterproof.
yes kevin.

"dear mr. scott.
in the past year, i have consolidated the entire scranton paper market.
it is warm feelings.
bet you i got mine for less than yours.
aEUR  lit the whole thing on fire.
I am starting my own paper company.
why not now?
i wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when i got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them.
aaaahh!
so... dwight is not going to do a job.
this... just in.
okay?
oh come on, stop the fake prissy act.
you do not have enough water in there?
it is all about give and take, but mostly it is about pushing each other.
david told me on the phone.
no, stop it!
so i am out.
it is not even a twirl, it is a spin.
kay.
wait!
i love the guy.
gah!
not a wizard, a hobbit.
well... i guess we should go tell the troops.
seriously, i do not mind sharing.
i have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it.
but i made too many mistakes.
this is it.
jack blaise.</i> by far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie.
i am- oh, thank you.
so much for keeping our secrets up high.
watch out for snakes!
um... "hey meredith, liz taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." because meredith's been divorced like, twice.
damn it!
do not look at me people.
oh, it is okay, I am going down.
yeah there is a volume knob on that thing.
do you really want to know?
um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and i heard ya, loud and clear, so, i am instituting some changes to make this more like prison.
sorry about that.
anything can happen at the dundies!
you want to hit me, you want to punch me?
when time is not a factor, i like to try out three or four different ones.
yeah.
pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in tallahassee, florida where I am going to be living for the next three weeks.
those people out there are clearly afraid.
do not throw it!
oscar?
oh.
t.m.i my friends.
well you get the picture.
grunting is scientifically proven to add more power.
all right.
single.
so our tragedy is your good luck.
me walking phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding.
jackie chan!
they almost bought from us.
got enough, weirdo?
so, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows.
oh my god!
can you believe that?
big changes coming to the old desk clump.
jim halpert.
that is unacceptable.
i see what you are doing.
no.
alright?
free of charge.
uh... alright.
gotcha!
you could be referring to anything.
who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
i invented tactic number eight.

there is going to be a free room?
jim, you are up.
here is my toast.
no, no, no, you do not need to go anywhere.
he hated fun.
pam, when I am sitting at this desk, I am a salesman.
and actually, you know what we should do?
ha ha.
good guy.
I am not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse.
the bartender asked for her id which i thought was odd because i pegged her at like 35. yeah, it was weird.
I would like to be interviewed for the position.
stanley!
yes, andy?
there he is, there he is.
that is all sir, you may go.
just want you to succeed pammy.
i do not want this to ruin her honeymoon.
the wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.

great.
battle stations everybody, let us go, go, go, go, go, go!
henrietta.
I am just saying... they would flank you.
who is this?
i am going to buy a sweater.
guys, get on this.
i know.
pepto-bismol, in his hot chocolate.
it is not true.
just keep it.
any of them?
it is surprising, um... because you did not expect it.
was that u2?
hello?
yes!
by now you are probably sick of hearing about dunder mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.
he is outta here!
i do not understand what he is saying.
if onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be erntedankfest.
hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you dwight junior and how much you loved that?
i need clean urine for the lady.
hmmm.
and you know what i think is the most attractive part of a woman's body?
he is not necessarily an old guy.
i command you to just go down and have fun tonight.
you owe me one, remember?
jim.
shh!
if you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.
okay.
no.
it just... goes a cup could find its way under the urine.
yes!
ok, well played.
everything here was made in china, pam.
you guys just are workin' for the weekend, are not you?
thank you, angela.
hey!
a lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids.
we are all best friends - i love everybody here.
it is bad.
I will do- I will do the best i can.
oh, you do?
what will be your first priority?
no.
and, like saber, it is from florida, and it is good.
they look cute.
let us go.
you did these... freehand?
all right, you do not respect me.
and i do not have anything for you.
hey, that is good.
nice to have oscar back.
you know what?
to soak up my tears.
listen, scott... we are losing money, okay?
all right.
i made it sterile.
ok, a little too far, crossed the line.
gosh!
okay.
uh, ow.
just say you want to get back together.
jim.
it is going to be cool, sleek santa.
and today they are being distracted by the other booths.
website.
hey, what is up.
oh, look, a curb.
actually, they just do not get very much work done when I am not here.
appalling.
dwight, no.
that is perfect.
double it.
911. use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
they are testing it now.
how do you start?
ok. this is the last <i>thing</i> that phyllis needs to see right now, dwight.
oh, wow.
he killed an entire family of raccoons.
have i ever lied to you?
that is what faggie means!
did you like that?
might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot... no.
loser, works, on saturday.
so stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
should have done this a long time ago.
okay everybody, big day.
make it happen.
erm, that is one of the 'big guys.' been on hold this whole time.
i already sold my condo.
you know what, that is the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate.
gay porn, straight porn, it is all goooooood!
um, maybe put it back in the truck.
sure.
at least not modern cabbage.
yeah... did you see that!
because of the downsizing.
ok, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.
oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
ok, um... the sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy.
classic.
cool.
meet my eye line, jim!
no, it is in like ten minutes.
and i am happy and i am rich and i never die.
thanks michael.
no, no, no, wait!
no, friends only.
pam, say hi.
scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
comedy; it is funny.
wait.
time in!
we-- do not you want to earn schrute bucks?
wrong!
ready?
bfd.
my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
like we were doing earlier.
yes, you know what?
we should have your contract done by thursday.
there.
no... no, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he is just using this roy thing as leverage.
what is a dollar worth in your land?
the winner gets angela.
hey, pam, pam- with this raise there are strings attached.
"hey darryl, how is it hangin'?
it is my duty... ...to investigate the crime scene.
are you still taking the antidepressants?
but sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that are not dentist appointments.
ok, you know what, i do not want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it is not fair to people with rabies.
does it bother me that i was not invited to michael's dinner party?
it is not a b and b. agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest.
stop.
i need people who are loyal.
he would always get rolled over by something.
voila, right in the wall.
no more conflict.
what do i do?
limbo, whoo!
do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
here we go.
hey, what a game, huh?
give me the bottle!!
tell michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
rule three: do not fall in love.
the building?
you can not smoke anywhere these days.
no way.
you want a list of my clients?
hmm, probably, but now i know something he does not want me to know.
well you know what?
really?
we should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than madge or heday.
I am so sorry I am late.
i actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
...jim.
well... hey, can we just focus?
all right.
you are the love of my life.
why do you have a diary?
nothing?
and i do not want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, carol.
i will not tell anybody.
thank you.
are you really not going to punch him?
he used to fight dogs.
do not be shy.
and if they do... sign me up... because i am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
a gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do i.  no, seriously, guys, I am not, i do not want to go into it at all.
aah!
testicular cancer, god.
and at some point, the daddy can not take a bath with the kids anymore.
I am right.
where are they?
alright.
if you want.
i would like your undivided attention, please.
your quarterlies look very good.
thanks for calling us all down here.
what?
what are my expectations for the group?
regis and kelly!
and in this case i think we are celebrating me.
yeah.
they do not even have paper.
do you want to do another test?
ok. alright.
oookay.
that is... what do you mean, "michael"?
i know that you are going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
okay.
yes!
okay.
michael, michael, no.
go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
what?
can i speak to a manager then?
okay.
so, what am i supposed to do?
no.
i have.
as your leader and your friend, i sort of demand that you can all speak in public as i can... and did... twice.
baby carrots.
pam, it is very complicated.
hi.
why did you pick this place?
go to my car.
a la, tonight we will be hosting at louie volpies!
okay, close your eyes, we need you to think.
well rested.
it is just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so potential, lots of potential.
you have unleashed the wolf!
welcome.
on me.
my party pad.
this is great.
right.
dammit, phyllis!
what for?
ok. fine.
oohh.
good.
they are getting on my nerves mom.
the two levels being, uh, "welcome to scranton"... and "i... love you." hey, what is the group that was from scranton that made it big?
ho!
mmm, mmm!
angela, lay it on me.
you want me to keep going?
i have bags under my eyes, pam.
what is that in your ear?
let us' remember we are all here for the dog society.
on-time delivery is the soil!
hey.
it is a good thing russia does not exist anymore.

I will go summon the troops!
okay, am i grabbing this one?
phyllis, our resident senior.

a night... at... the roxbury.
michael's up on the roof and he is acting strange!
alright.
i got stuck in traffic.

you need somebody who- who understands your references.
I am kind of sick of the attitude around here.
i do not want to be shila, i like being michael scott.
she is my ex-lover!

he has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them.
guy goes fishing with hand grenades.
i wore woman's clothes.
how about this i throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' i lost my head when i fell in love with you.' it is easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school.
wet cement, outside.
i think this is going to be the best christmas party ever.
sure.
"sedes introiti." seat of entrance.
brenda, could jan and i have a moment alone?

i do not tell michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.
you are a jerk.

if you want to just, anything?
yep, i did.

...since the world was turning.
but that is my name.
ten years, you will figure it out.
$18,000 and a chance at the title!
can you?
tu esporte!
you know, as you do at weddings.
so business related, right?
you, you, you, you... who are you?
because, well, jim.
i literally- i put no thought into the wrapping at all.
i am not thinking.
that is so sweet.
you made it, suit up, you are on the team!
except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because i have started my very own paper company right here in the building.
you are seeing how the sausage gets made.
you got to help me here.
we are not worthy.
it is nuts.
what is that, pipsqueak?
yeah.
write that down.
james halpert.
for-okay, okay here is what I am going to do.
hey!
wow.
nobody needs to introduce this guy.
do not listen to her.
one side, as sharp as you would ever want something to be.
so what I would like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I will see what i can do.
after me.
hey.
so, mum's the word.
trying to get work done.
pam, are you all right?
to save on electricity I have installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights.
which will be fine.
hang up!
jim!
birthday time is over!
I am great.
it is britney bitch.
this is a good one.
it is really good to see you, too.
hey pam, did you see this?
yeah.
you know what; i bet she cracked it at home.
just no guests.
it is a character I have been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble.
okay.
yes, i am sure, jim.
oh, thanks.
alright, fine.
gah, the dreadmill.
and know what i did?
do i need to be liked?
a small box... not too confining.
join me please, will not you?
air force is cool.
if i was offensive in any way, i... humor works in... ...crazy ways.
should the hawk even care?
why have i stayed at dunder mifflin for so long?
is there a belt above black?
so be it, then you have lost credibility.
I am telling you, all i will need are my instincts and my will to survive.
the watermark... it is a one time thing.
i, oh, just, um, i know i was trying to, expense reports.
why pay more to sit next to old tranny claus over there, when you can sit on my lap.
what is michael seeing right now?
can we down the reverb?
like a... just a dead cat.
show of hands?
yeah, well my feet do not.
sounds pretty good, right?
so double offensive.
'I am so smart.
i am beyonce always.
oh!
okay.
they are only one of staples' top competitors in the area.
in addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of schrute farms, i can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications.

he says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff.
i know you like that store.
all right, happy friday.
good game.
i can see that is what you wanted all along.
you have got to tell andy about us.
well, I am writing a message.
dwight, you saw darryl move it, right?
i mean, most people do not even know that a candy cane represents a shepherd's crook, which i assure you does not taste like peppermint.
unbelievable.
it is important to go every month and get your prostate checked.
you know what?
they are a great audience.
slim jim.
i do not even... what is the point of that?
oh that, well, that is pam.
your proctologist.
thanks david!
total deaths belongs to gettysburg but when you are talking about d.p.a., that is deaths per acre... ...nothing beats the battle of schrute farms.
give me the job!
you are?
it is a ram thing.
not any of this.
even the hot ones are not really that skinny.
no!
delta burke, i do declare.
whoo!

i have crossbows.
that is what she said.

remember?
this is the way... i do not... okay, just listen.
and I have incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
you know what?

i always wanted to be hay king.
only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in russian.
whereas back here in scranton i am still top dog, in a fairly large pond.
"harry?" it was over quickly as it had come.
andy, listen to me.
see, that is what christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, "man, i wish i got that." i mean, that is just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else.
i just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
well, ok, you have just committed a felony.
no need to panic.
and it is the sincerest form of flattery.
if it makes andy angry, so be it.
you apologize to me right now.
you bet.
hmm.
it is true.
i just need a moment to consider your offer.
come on.
i know just the man for the job.
jim, come on!
but if something else came up, i would definitely not go.
he can tell when he is being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
I am so much better than you are.
I am leaving for the day at four.
cute kids, thanks for coming.
oh, god.
it is michael scott.
would not that be fun?
what are you doing?
because he is going to own his own business.
okay, okay,  stand up.
i think that was ... i was probed.
ok, wait.
sha-ka!
normal.
okay, hold on for a second, folks.
i will poison your food.
and yet I am hesitant.
i see the sales department as the furnace.
ahem.
i do not believe we have been introduced.
i have my book on business, somehow i manage.
oh, it is.
I am getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
totally got the best of that interchange.
yeah, yeah... uh, i can not do this pam.
con artist.
ahh, get away, cretin.
ok, dwight.
jan levinson-gould.
okay, you get out of here, big dog.

she is old enough to be your mom for one thing.
okay.
no!
excellent question, pam.
no problem.
can i... can i just do it please?
bury them in my yard.
what?
is mr. schofield there?
since then I have loved working with pam and she is frankly wonderful, but i hate her.
stop talking all at once!
hey.
well, i knew it existed, and i chose to let it die.
i can not tell you how much leftover guacamole i have ended up eating over the years.
it is yours.
yeah, but now his heart is in thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.
is there anyone else here that is lice free?
that is... that is a great story.
no billy, i have not done that dance since my wife died.
my god, dwight.

closest would be twin.
sometimes I will start a sentence, and i do not even know where it is going.
it keeps her docile.
nice!
you complained that angela's giving you dirty looks.
black.
i really messed up.
that was not easy because i really liked her a lot.
this not knowing, that is what is killing me.
oh, yeah, that sounds good.
let us see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
you are not.
she will not give it to me.
where are my leads?
"we?" kelly will be even worse than darryl.
she is our international sales consultant.
let us play with him.
usually hit those.
no.
what am i going to do with a removed uterus?
three hours?
go back to work!
great.
no, no, no.

she poses.
my gift.
my bad.
those are my keys.
can you read that back to me?

well how do you think i feel?
abort mission.
well, okay, in a nutshell, what I am saying is... leadership.
it is a tough one.
oh, you get kicked.
ok. hey you guys.
we said... i know there were certain things we said... hmmm, that is weird, that is weird... it is kind of weirding me out.
enough of this garbage.
i can not say.
do it.
you look great!
i really think that papa would want you to do this.
i love you guys, so much.
if... okay, if this makes the difference, I am going to tell it that you were responsible.
ladies and gentlemen, i present to you the dream team.
stay low... this is it... there he is.
hey, did you sms text message me?
eeee.
that is not part of the plan.
back to work, everybody.
hey batter batter batter.
apparently scranton has the best sales of any regional branch.
i am no longer your boss.
jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.
oh, man.
overall, I would say my first radio interview went pretty much the way i expected.
i saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
absolutely but not really.
give me the phone.
that is meredith, the birthday girl.
um,  taking her to sandals, jamaica, all-inclusive.
tomorrow's fertilizer, am i right?
oh- okay , what?
well, could you tell me something that i did <i>right</i>?
help me!
gabor, gabor.
it will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
there is roy riding the big rig.
inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
she is just not ready.
mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse... okay.
morning dwight.
you came into my office voluntarily.
no.
i wish i had your confidence, i really do.
no, i will ex-squeeze you.
you get something good this year?
it is just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
i wish i had a lair.
aw, that is so sweet of you!
ohh, no, no, no!
hey!
very good.
michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited.
well, that figures.
you are on.
no way.
mmm.. roy?
aggggh, that stings!
that is why i always whip open doors.
it was anonymous." "well, guess what,  that was michael scott."  "but it was anonymous, how do you know?" "because I am him." come here.
yeah, well, that is not going to happen.
I am trying to be a good mentor.
because you think you know everything.
i left packer alone with nellie for way too long.
that is part of my job as regional manager.
can you believe that?
and what advice has andy given to you today that you have acted on?
oh, my god.
but in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
so am i. does not matter.
it is really -- on the internet, it is a really -- that is a really good, good, thing.
oh god.
too busy knocking boots.
we had to come over right away, it is urgent.
what is this contraption, i do declare?
and then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image.
seriously?
yes, sorry too late.
fine, i chose the global relief foundation.
no.
sort of bat clean up and- that is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
and my hat's off to them.
you could pay off my debts.
how much you paying her?
i cannot tell you how i plan to escape.
i was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
it is where business happens.
yes, that is a good idea.
welcome aboard.
hey.
this is katy.
my mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better.
that is not true.
michael, i know what you are thinking.
what can i do, michael.
no.
well.
why are you late?
mmm-hmm.
so you... god, we totally got you.
yeah, we have to have it for the office.
wwwwiiiillllmmmmaaaa!
let me get that for you.
mmm, cookies.
if you ever need any help, i am just a phone call away.
it is good.
this big fat pig is beautiful.
well you should take a, a film education course.
wha-?
you are not dating angela anymore.
aah!
andy had erin.
what are you doing to my computer?
ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.
they say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast andy's play, they took mine.
have you seen her painting, jim?
jan's here.
excellent question.
i... okay, okay, okay,  alright, thank you.
yes, i did, for you, princess.
but believe me a lot of thought went into this.
you love him.
here we go.
i want to be here when you fire her ass.
okay, deal!
probably get on pam.
if i wanted to see a pissing contest, I would lock mose in the chicken coop.
my whole life, i have known two things: i love sex, and i want to have kids.
god, that is terrible man.
the only thing i have not managed is people.
but, we do not employ children.
okay.
good!
i learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
but we are all in the same boat.
that is why it is funny.
jim?
no.
that was great.
what?
seal it off.
I am going to need a list of every man you have ever had sex with.
listen, she ignored my ultimatum.
i made a family!
she will have a greekaccino.
what is the matter?
"oh buy me something expensive or I am going to kill myself."  that is not - i do not care about that.
y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to china, and that may be the true, but what they do not tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend.
so... best to just lay off.
yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
because me, and my, posse guys are going to be in your face.
failure of any kind is failure.
i only give my organs to my real friends.
shut up, shut up.
glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
you know, it is just, it is just fun.
pssh, stupid.
your spine is jacked.
this now i have an eye on.
I will make sure to write you a glowing reference.
oh, hey temp.
yes.
seventy, eighty, one, two three.
opportunity of a lifetime.
how do you know this?
what the hell are you reading to them?
I am trying to make him feel important.
i think it is tiny.
say what you said.
get in the car.
okay.
i got it.
chicken fight!
uhh.
what were you doing in there?
good.
I am not too fast.
okay, well.
find a killer joke that will just blow everybody away at the seminar later.
do not tell my fiance I am drinking on a wednesday.
i am.
you can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
and it is terrible.
or townie?
you do not even know.
there they are.
with all my heart.
the hand strikes and gives a flower.
no.
ah, all right.
what the hell is going on here?!
what if he is a murderer?
umm, can i pay you tomorrow?
uhh, cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him.
no, i feel it is my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
how did aj get in your house?
boom!
and her boyfriend will die.
what is your win rate?
so actually the hero got two girls.
it is got to be something else.
all right.
it is such a stereotype.
no, i went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.
anything in the world.
to a child's imagination that is mr. fork and lieutenant knife and... ms. fork.
no one can hear me.
need a thumb tack?
blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay?
forward it like it is hot.
fine.
dwight betrayed me once before.
five more minutes?
someone else.
everyone, may i have your attention?
let me see your teeth.
no, i think it is- yep.
I will set it up right now.
town cars suck.
crazy day.
i did not know we were in communist sweden.
guh.
mm-hm.
welcome.
with sex.
more of a, barbaric growl.
I am not usually the butt of the joke.
and who is this "the" steve nash?
couple weeks ago i went to get a new cellphone and i wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'who are your 5 friends?' and I am, like, 'uh... ' i did not even know i could not even think.
i do not know.
it is a costume.
you know?
but i do not have to give her the good stuff.
so, I am betting that it is waterproof.
that is it?
phyllis?
morning cheer.
you pathetic, short little man.
i know, because you have no role models.
nobody likes to be flashed.
and I am thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.
and the day he sells that business back to dunder mifflin.
erin, how many times do i have to tell you?
michael!
you are going to mess with me, is that what you are going to do?
so... what else is up?
yes it is!
it is hard to imagine you playing softball.
look at his face!
i go over other people's heads.
i can prove it, watch this.
a thousand times more.
you know what?
there.
and without paper, it could not have happened.
you said butt.
okay, he remembers toby, the most forgettable man in the known world.
you will have pancakes and you will like it.
ah, that will not come into this place.
oh,  lazy.
ohh.
it is only-- it is 15 feet down, it is at a 45-degree angle.
redact it.
let us go.
uh-oh.
five times.
find out if there is a way to tell by just looking at them.
what is?
i am saying... that... maybe i was drunk.
okay.
what about you?
well, you know something.
alright.
it is not the greatest one either... and it is clear we are not going to carry them.
I am going to prove it right here and now.
my proudest moment here was not when i increased profits by 17% or when i cut expenses without losing a single employee.
what are... what are you doing?
i can not do anything about it, i can not... you know.
jim!
idiots.
dwight's an idiot!
hey, what is up?
no, i do not.
hi pam, how are you?
i feel better.
i got it.
stanley, i got you some ganja.
okay.
i got a knock-knock joke.
time to make the donuts!
hello.
cool.
ahhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
stat.
do you understand how a deposit works?
wow, yuck.
yeah!
clearly, karen is trying to get back at us because jim dumped her.
all right.
why?
it is not a race.
hope you find your paradise... come tomorrow, feel no pain!
he is not much of an entertainer.
i know.
see, because i need you... to keep me grounded.
yourself.
when you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you.
it is good that its cold it will drive business inside.
i know.
this is a damn shame, but we are like a family here and that just, that will not fly.
you know what?
what was the point of spilling the drink on me?
phyllis?
how does that sound?
very good.
so you will be reporting to me, then.
not you, erin.
no!
no, no.
you just stick it- it is not really your choice, is it?
my sensei, ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a sempai.
push!
was it phillip?
there is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.
bickering!
i say no.
oh!
wear your wedding dress.
follow me to your desk.
how could... right in the middle of the carpet.
ah, you do.
that is his punishment for not being here on time.
and you already met her, pam beesly, office hottie.
okay.
before you guys came in, i was talking to the guys.
will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
ok, let us go.
nothing sticks to him.
great work.
because an office can not function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
hey, you wanted to see me?
step up there.
i would like to have all the racists brought together and take darryl philbin out to lunch.
well.
let us just talk about you, as always.
it is like...  you know what I am talking about?
shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 psi, bon appetit!
do not shave my lips.
chain of command.
oh, god!
no, i do not think they are.
that-- wow.
no, michael.
meow.
aaaah... weird.
kevin, where are you?
yeah, get them, creed!
I have never quit anything in my life.
you choose!
this is uh, concierge marie... ...who works at our hotel.
i have got big balls.
he always wears the ears, and i always give him grief about looking like spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be spock, for some reason.
look, i do not want to leave this branch that i love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round.
i wish i could make potato salad that good.
yes!
so how much are we going to lose?
cool.
yeah.
copy.
count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
in my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex.
ok?
i love you guys.
they are cool.
woo!
no, it is not.
wait, so you are the boss?
i would simply send him a different piece each day.
no, no, no.
hey, this is ryan.
calves.
yeah, well, i was told that holly would be here, single and ready to date.
I have fallen and i can not get up!
well, that is not going to happen!
actually, that would be a good salary for me, do not you think?
michael?
you kidding?
it is so much fun.
so stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
toby's going to fix you up.
what?
I am hurt, i have hurt myself.
listen, i know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here.
oh.
you know what pam?
it is empty!
guess what he is doing now.
i always... yes, i do.
who is phillip?
so, thank you very much.
and then michael scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
try me.
anything could have been in there.
i did it.
jan, we need to talk.
she is pretty cute is not she?
well, okay, i based it on what i felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this is not even about what ryan thinks.
abraham lincoln once said that, "if you are a racist, i will attack you with the north." and those are the principles that i carry with me in the workplace.
mo' money, mo' problems.
oh well, we will have to go someplace else then i guess.
are we ready to go?
hostile work environment, kevin.
temp!
these two people, they are living together, they are having lots of consentual sex- yes.
they sound great.
probably get some negative feedback on my ebay profile.
all right.
hoo.
here you go!
all right, just relax, keep your pants on.
come on.
you could not help your marriage.
yeah!
angela, your turn.
shall we?
i know you said no questions, but... i have an early dinner that i need to get to... with the chief of police.
because it is for me and michael only why is everyone clumped around accounting?
well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
okay, well, allow me.
he is my tribe.
easy no.
ok. i will make it quick.
that was the curse, stanley, and we are trying to find the because of the curse.
yeah.
you really do not get it, do you?
because I am the boss.
what is dwight up to?
me on the other hand, i would be lost without this place.
yes!
most of it is irrelevant.
oh really, jim?
let us go.
it was dark, warm, wet.
I am trying to confuse your sense of direction.
so alike.
okay, here is a tough decision for you.
i shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
sabre hq is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit.
ah!
okay, here we go, there is a cow.
better than most horses.
set?
ahh!
the people.
so, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
and i proves my point.
oh my god!
let us get right down to business.
psh.
they are extraordinary.
tit for tit.
i can not finish.
that is hilar... oh, god!
good for the world.
why?
pam, i do not make the rules.
great.
having fun?
where are they?
somebody get him!
I am not going to answer it, it is the kgb.
your journey begins now.
cool it.
and their jaws just dropped to the floor.
how is the workload on all of dwight's old accounts?
run!
yes, so, no thank you.
jimbo!
five more minutes of mega-desk?
i would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned french sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you would ever seen!
nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me.
oh, my god!
i thought that you were awesome.
okay, what are you doing?
hey, so listen, i was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and i formed an alliance.
there is so much more to it than that.
okay?
no you did not, phyllis.
yes it is a good idea.
alright.
give me my keys.
nothing, other than once again, i am just thankful that i am a paper salesman.
who is this dwight?
you and me.
i did not put a roof..."  ... we laughed so hard... it was hilarious... oh...  so yes, I am very excited about the diwali party.
what?
it is not real.
oh do you?
emergency protocol.
we are going to put our best minds on it.
nope.
and once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
hey, what was she like?
well, here is the thing.
such a sweet guy.
i love you.
so good.
shut it.
happy st. patrick's day.
like a grownup.
no.
what if i told you i had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
um.
it is got a little bit of a zing to it and i hope that it gives you a flavor of what we are all about here at dunder mifflin.
not my style.
i mean her hair, clothes, it is all falling off in great big clumps.
i buy my suits the old fashioned way.
does anybody out there have intuition?
oh... yeah... ugh.
that is possible.
dwight hit a bear.
yeah!
be careful what you wish for toby.
come on.
i am headed to philadelphia for the annual northeastern mid-market office supply convention.
this is where our love faces its toughest test.
i love you.
i got it.
i really appreciate it.
4:35.  alright, almost made it.
ok, I am sorry.
take me to robert.
jim where is pam?
we have already tried that.
i want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
and you burned over a thousand calories walking home.
cafe disco!
I am not going to be able to find my shows.
i do not think she would be missed.
if the boat's a-rockin', do not come knockin'!
that is the best thing?
ye- no.
bond.
we are going to make a statement.
hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video.
it will probably be on a boat.
oh, what?
so what is the problem, pam?
action.
about two more minutes .
and then i thought maybe by the time i was 40, but by 40, i had less money than when i was 30.  maybe by my 50s, i do not know.
i am bond fire, james bond fire.
six percent?
i will see you this weekend for the penguins.
that is my white out.
i will try to manage my excitement!
we had a 15 year on our beet farm.
like benjamin button in reverse.
ye - ok, yes.
thank you.
but you know what?
my shallow heart's the only thing that is beating... i have no idea.
easy there, old girl.
hey, hey.
mm-hmm.
wish i was.
um, i do not know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
what?
no, it is not.
oh, boy.
you successfully backed down the mob!
i mean I am in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you are in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.
really, they are bad.
um, let us see.
pays five million dollars.
yeah!
the employees went crazy, i got no help from corporate.
his cappa is detated from his head!
eager.
bend at the knees.
i need some meat.
this is hide toshi hasagawa.
so who is the real boss?
that would be perfect.
do you have plans tonight?
well stanley, maybe you are feeling that you do not respect me because you do not know me very well.
I will do it!
in the other bed.
i cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
well, do not do that.
idiot.
it was loud, but it was warm.
and she called it nuts?
push it.
yeah.
alright... oh!
yes.
shuffle up and deal.
i got egg all over my face.
do not laugh; please do not laugh this time dwight.
why would you say that-- get out!
how long has he been in the bathroom?
oh and i also built this table.
all we know is that a gun fired.
you are not perfect either.
give us some time to catch up, and... ay, kay.
that is how  the game's played.
but this is not a kid's environment.
oscar, good.
sound good?
that is good.
on the count of three we are all going to put down our guns.
how are you, janet?
here, tell us your war stories.
i care too much.
makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
oh, he is sure.
i tried hopping, kevin, and i bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
oh... narcolepsy.
yeah.
yes.
that is my stapler.
aw.
erin, back row.
you keep forgetting about him.
$2 billion dollar a year industry.
you wrote down those fake diseases did not you?
...or biologically.
come on!
1,2,3- what are we going to do?
who is this old fart?
hmmm?
okay- oh, jim.
you said the program is not open to caucasians.
what belt are they?
okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
is someone on the roof?
um, headed out.
I am like mr. miyagi and yoda rolled into one.
hey, buttercup.
oh, you are... you are dead.
i was right.
back to a convict.
it is like slapping someone with silence.
rolando,  I would like you to meet pam.
this is going to blow your mind.
other than me.
thanks for coming.
no, no!
oh good.
i like to think of it as a kids place.
today is a very special day for me.
that is it.
i have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.
ah!
the most important wedding until i get married.
i do not know.
luke, seriously.
just - sh - shut - shut up.
and that really inspired me.
I am going to call him.
there are four new deadly weapons in this office.
like, who do i call about that?
no, he is a little... little dim.
it is not a prank.
hey, josh, how ya doing?
you like lobster?
because i like to know.
so you know what?
well, i will be in my office making toys for the good children.
it was ryan.
bathroom.
yeah, i shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my mac.
uh huh, uh huh.
are you crying?
pam i have a loaded gun in my desk at work.
and i was just hoping you would give me your approval.
there are moments where we can affect change.
go!
well, things between me and clark are good, but not great.
what is it of?
well, then it will be easier for you.
bye michael!
blowing up balloons i thought.
okay.
its says here that it is a 300ft drop.
over the last few weeks, things have been changing here.
you got it?
yeah probably.
do not ask me where i got the invisible ink.
"hey, you think you can do my job better?" i do not know.
okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for.
hey, everybody, look what we have!
hey, hey.
right.
so what kind of farming you into, huh?
i always do.
my resignation?
i do not see it.
and i will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me.
no!
no, what did you say?
what do you want from this job, provided the company does not go out of business?
or we just go for the loft.
or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer?
500 and one penny.
ha ha, i knew it!
you are wearing eyeliner, jim.
that is the way you are supposed to do it, idiot.
i want you to grab it, i want you to get my guitar.
there is an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down... there is a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down... ...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... you know, i really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers.
because it is very scary stuff.
get that for you.
let that be a lesson to you all.
oscar, homosexual accountant.
I will give you a hint.
dunder-mifflin, scranton is being shut down.
hmm.
flesh eating bacteria.
no, no, i can do this.
kelly!?
well, okay... and andy, andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman.
that is what she said.
who would put a poison dart, well, i mean, i do not know that it is poison.
ok, I will punch you.
even though i only went number one.
he is what is important, whatever his name is.
yeah, i did.
do you think we are going to have sex tonight?
yes!
so when i heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, i thought  sorry.
let us gangbang this thing and go home.
yeah!
come on.
see?
i just got back from my procedure, so- how are you doing?
it is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
rule violation.
oh look at that.
oh, stretchin'.
okay!
let us get this popping.
where is she?
I am pretty sure we said slap.
okay uh, huh.
i got a lot of responses.
who stands to benefit from our downfall?
look.
everybody, except stanley.
those are collectible action figures and they are worth more than your car.
good day.
pam, would you care for a bagel?
oh, that is gross.
dwight, you have... no, you have something... god, you look like such an idiot!
let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern india, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
okay, all right.
lady!
well... oh, you got to be... josh?
my indian culture seminar was going great until toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images.
you cannot say "i was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, kelly.
i love you.
i think it is too small if anything.
oh, no big deal.
so that is the problem, is solved.
