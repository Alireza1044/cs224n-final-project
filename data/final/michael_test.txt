this might get ugly.
i stole.
ohhh, no.
I am not going to give it to you.
i do not own dunder mifflin, okay?
ok. four months ago, i dated a woman named holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I have even considered getting back into that arena again.
i do not believe you.
like that people are stupid, and that they are idiots, and that they are sluts.
i got turned around.
do you have any ice?

before we get started i wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies.
there you are.
no!

i cannot believe that you sided with charles.
well david, i will be honest with you.
all right.
before i forget, i wanted to let you know, if you had not already heard, uh, jan and i are back together.

you are probably going to get carded, so i can make you a fake id.
showing your colors.
it is so not fair that they want me to resign.

i command you to just go down and have fun tonight.
front and center.
man, did they move paper!
good.
flippity flip!
today is spring cleaning day here at dunder mifflin.

rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives.
usually a ten, but I am feeling like a zero.
i mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way.
fruit.
and suck it is one of  them.
you ready to do this?
i am here to see you off.
darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?
maybe I will stay.
damn it.
yes.
this is, this is totally on me.
this is going to feel so good, getting this thing off my chest.
how cute.
all right.
you know what i think we should do?
the reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.
i bet.
hello, i am here for the small business seminar.
like garbage?
um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our blue cross account?
hey.
okay.
hello!
you stupid son of a bitch.
i do not know.
well, now i can say that i went to a museum.
win/win/win.
you should wear this watch.
I am very sorry.
I have been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?
i want you to listen to me, friend, and i want you to listen to me good.
pam, you are a member of this family.
okay, I am not hindu, but... carol.
that is how your drinking affected me.
okay.
bill cosby.
i did not want to hear about it either, stanley, but i did and now i can not stop picturing it.
i think it goes without saying.
you made it, suit up, you are on the team!
and i was just hoping you would give me your approval.
I am not superstitious, but... I am... i am a little-stitious.
and i proves my point.
phyllis?
oh, okay.
ok, i am going to count down from five.
oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me.
okay, do not be nervous, just picture her naked.
hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest." he is totally wrong, pam.
i know, i know, i know, I am sorry.
thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing.
it is hot today.
hey mer.
I am sorry.
you know, that is the thing!
yes!
hi.
dunder mifflin.
thank you very much.
do not give me that.
oh, I will be fine.
i can not tell you how much leftover guacamole i have ended up eating over the years.
stop it!
shut up, nick.
great.
you did not know that?
all right, now, you are the expert.
that is so sweet.
dwight is confusing you.
go ahead.
how do i put this delicately?
really?
i think...  that maybe you should... what I am saying is that, ok, see what i did?
no, no you are wrong about this.
well, no.
and secondly, you need supply.
there is something wrong with january our first fight.
and you do not have my numbers on speed dial.
just this once?
so monetize that.
which will not be hard, because it is going to be awesome.
um, alright.
ship.
are women like that?
bwah ha ha...   ... ha ha ha.
obviously!
"office depot is an annoying store.
peace out, seacrest!
if i wanted to hit you, i would have hit you.
dwight, there is no way i can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
alright.
it is not.
could, could a row boat support her?
ooh.
i have an idea.
ahhh!
get it?
i want my old parking space back.
so good to have closure.
we need it yesterday.
you sit down, you are supported.
yes.
i tried hopping, kevin, and i bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
my whole life, i have known two things: i love sex, and i want to have kids.
I am just a little bit scared.
keep it moving.
either way, i am going to need some talking down.
we had to let him go.
because I am drunk, i can not even find her.
interesting.
huh.
but I am sort of the conductor of the office here, right?
read it and weep.
to the right?
yeah, good job.

yes, i did.
mmm.
that look?
hey, mikela lasker, how are you?
uh... .
i do not know about that.
i want to do it today.
it is not a jewish joke, so do not worry.
that was, that was slick.
i was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor.
50 cents, yeah.
we are not selling.
that does not make any sense.
welcome to my convenience store.
okay, first, incest is bad.
everyone, now  calm down!
and you know where milk comes from!
long day.
just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want.
thank you very much.

how are you, janet?
could you just please wait till i go get it?
that is what you said.
down here, she is got a boob job.
we are proud of you.
why can not boys play with dolls?
come on.
no, no no- that is a good gift actually.
I have been trying.
noble darryl.
and I am thinking that uh, next time you are in the shower, you should check yourself out.
i do not want to say this twice, it is too painful and I am too depressed.
are you kidding me?
what if pam was a lesbian?
I will leave right away.
welcome children of the scranton industrial park community.
whoa.
so this is one of my favorite places in the world.
you know what?
jim!
you know what?
so go to your corner.
show of hands.
here we go.
this is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.
it does not have to just be the idiots.
the biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
did anyone get drunk already?
hilarious.
you are the voice of this company, right?
really?
great.
no, it is just mileage mostly, but there is one chapter that i call wisdoms.
if the salad is on top, i send it back.
do you understand that jim is like a brother to me, and i would never do anything inappropriate?
oh, so an aquarium.
no.
thank you!
just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.
everyone inside the car was fine, stanley!
that crosses the line.
right?
just like i believe in all of you.
it is going to be a bumpy one!
how would you have wanted to do it?
alright.
I am actually having trouble focusing on my job.
captain jack has a problem with authority.
you read my mind.
so, it all starts with a handshake.
so that is no help to us.
hey.
you know what jim, there are two santas in the room.
hey!
because i know it happened.
this whole thing just kind of stinks.
red cross, you know, racket.
well, can we overcome these differences?
what is the office actually goes under?
pros: he is classy.
all right, see you at one.
let me ask you- ok, let me ask you this.
man, i worked hard.
okay, all right.
no i will not!
when you use something to block- i think everybody knows what i am talking about.
video games.
there is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?
no.
stay- oh!
why did you send her away?
you people are revolting.
they hooked me up with an attorney.
well, it is probably because you do not get  them.
oh -hoh!
lots to do, lots to do.
hey!
that is crazy talk!
and then when i actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show.
because you are invited and you are invited and you are invited and you and you and you and you and you and you- what?
okay.
yeah?
i got dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do.
you me?
and on my drives back, i am going to learn spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.
no, you-no.
hmm.
so he is really not a part of our family.
give me the details of how that happened.
um, but i am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success.
um.
we have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white?
good morning.
uh oh!
or at least business associates who get along.
it is been four months since i was with holly, and she was way hotter then stacy.
so close.
goodnight, jim.
we are going now!
lazy scranton, the electric city.
i want you to grab it, i want you to get my guitar.
i... yeah, yeah.
but jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?

uh... uh, okay.
comments?
let me present you.
and i am that big man.

i am king of forwards.
good morning.
you are english, correct?

yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.
accounting?

i am upper management.
a guy on a train with no answers.
dwight, dwight.
you are welcome.
ow!
yes, and i am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days.
everybody!
there is a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.

giggle-giggle, juji-juji, i get it, i get it.
i, uh... we are just clicking on every level.
thank you.
yeah.
i did not know you played soccer, dwight.
and when the right guy comes along, you will know it.
i will not.
talk to you monday.
thank you very much!
well, there is no easy way of saying this.
but toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.
no!
but i figured I would rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.
do you understand how a deposit works?
go ahead.
ok, oscar, i do not need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
uh-oh, who is in trouble?
and i feel like i need to go to nashua and get closure.
is that a wig?
i used to sit right here.
i can make a difference, remember, I am the one who started this whole thing off by hitting meredith with my car.
on a boat, who knows?
i know, i know.
which one of these is coolest?
ooh.
why do not you guys deal with it?
nothing.
this is the novelization of the movie precious based on the book push by sapphire.
what did you really think, honestly.
i mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this.
but we are all in the same boat.
want to hear it?
it was not that long ago.
oh god!
deactivate the car alarm.
erin, listen to me.
okay, just close your eyes.

oh, no, no.
my point is i said what i wanted to say and mema, i hope you heard every word.

so just cut me some slack.
practice olympics.
well, this year's going to be different.
i had to use win/lose on that.

i used to stand in here and wish i was out there.
yeah, you are a real pain in the ass.

they punk'd us good!
oh really?
if there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
no problem.

you want a big bowl of ice cream.
yeah.
stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks.
and yeah, jim this is the time to stop putting dwight's personal effects into jell-of.
maybe because she is my girlfriend.
but then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion".

"in addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schrute." who wants to take paintball lessons?
that was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs.
and by the time i got out the pony was already in the truck.
in that case, war was the right choice.
i just have had a bad day.
you are worried about the party?
or, like stormin' norman schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it is over, we will not have to deal with those iraqis anymore.
that was good!
try my googi, googi.
okay, I will talk to you later.
right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting.
what is it?
this just... it is the sales... i see the sales department down there.
and this is roy.
sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads.
stanley!
you are not going to be able to talk back.
what is glee, some television program?
let us do this!
although, it has been chaotic lately.

the shield.
meredith?
i went -- i once went 28 years without having sex.

you have done enough already.
do you know what just happened?
time after time my branch leads in sales.
okay, see ya guys!
who is there?
like me and january  or oscar... and some guy.
yeah, i think that is pretty boss.
packer and i once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that <i>they</i> were crazy.
um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
we are going to do a fun one.
it is casino night like las vegas.
t.m.i my friends.

the office is being pulled apart!
alright.
where the hell is andy?

this strappy young lad sitting here is phyllis' father, albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, are not you albert, hah?

i mean, come on!
i hate shushing.
yeah.
it was a lot of snap decisions.
hi stranger!

it will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
you down with the dundie-" alright, alright, joke landed.
dwight, just... look, i just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake.
how you doing?
let us do it.
i already have the ring.
well, this is not about work.
mike myers, snl.

this party is actually a really big step for us.
night after night, town after town, all across america.
good.
i love it.
woohoohoowoo.
cancel it!
this is going to blow your mind.
i am michael scott, co-manager.

in a good way!
man!
oh.
i did.
jackson five.
oh, yeah, that sounds good.
oscar, enough with the girl talk please.

but do not take my word for it.
ahh.
you having a wardrobe malfunction there?
okay, moving backwards, our i.t.
so do i sign?
and it should not stop us from having fun.
okay, i have immunity.
do i feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that i was invited to?
they are out there thinking, "wow, my boss really cares about me.
no, no, no, no.
what?
hey, uh, no, please?
wow.
oh, that is great.
i can see why he and jan are no longer together.
that one makes me think... of death.
no.
what did you get tonight?
ah ha  yup.
and then it needed a jesus.
what?
hey.
go puck yourself!
all right, those might be his.
hooters?
creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel?
oh!
are you kidding me?
i know everything there is to know about paper.
and after i finished vomiting, i was more relaxed than i ever have been.
pam and jim are together.
come on everybody!
dwight.
by far, the least popular people here.
god, you look like such an idiot.
hey jan, speaking of stamford, hannah brought in her baby.
um... so are you in down this weekend?
you?
i have not talked to her since.
i can not force you to go down but i can entice you.
a disease that has largely been eradicated in the us.
i know.
real sports with bryant gumble.
yeah.
and we need to do something about it.
okay, everybody, shh!
this does not feel as important though.
oh, ok. there were a bunch of complaints about dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
i do not think that i can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.
oh, that is brilliant!
relax.
january i think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
good night.
where you at?
alright, you know what?
do we save customer service?
you are welcome.
mr. grotti we meet again.
this is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that i wish to share it with me, myself and i. when i return, i hope to be a completely changed human being.
our company is worth nothing.
i would like your undivided attention, please.
okay, okay.
ooh!
erin... what are you doing?
um, do not get mad at me.
i guess they got what they want.
give me some.
give this a try.
even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity.
let us see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
just bragging rights.
if you need to know somebody is name, just ask me.
really terrific.
i know just he place.
hey.
what happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away?
okay, go, go, go, go!
no way.
and you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
i-i-ugh, ok. all right.
what do i have to live for?
it was not.
he said, we have been sold.
well... what are you doing?
they do not care.
pam, show's just getting started.
... ryaaaaan ... ryyyyan!
under this regime, it will not leave this office.
would you go find jim, and send him in here, please?
aaahhh I am burning, help me!
mistakes are just successes that you mess up.
i was... i really was not going to flaunt this.
and that is when his head was separated from the rest of him.
sorry, too busy can not even come to the door.
ah, no, no, no, no.
corporate has given dwight two strikes.
that is why you suck!" no.
packer.
so, when, um, can i see you again?
what is up?
and ohh, look who is here to sign off on it!
great.
that would be bad.
anyways, if i was mean in any way to you, i am sorry.
as you can smell there is a lot of different odors going on in here.
sight unseen.
andy's mom.
pam, just be professional.
pam-pam!
the day he starts a business.
that is nice.
shut up.
well... mm, the big apple.
it looks cute though.
i think the problem is the chicks.
just do it, okay?
as it turns out you can not just check someone into rehab against their will.
he is not necessarily an old guy.
i can not see because i am in a-  gah!
ok, third wheel, why do not you do that?
what is wrong with dwight?
you did it!
show me that farm.
please!
ok. thank you all for coming.
what is that?
working on it.
how did- how are you inspired?
keep massaging please.
i have to hear it from her.
i think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
no, hey, hey.
ok?
i have to go.
whoo!
oh, oooh his mistress.
okay, here we go.
i will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
this is moe.
it is complicated with january  and i do not know where i stand, or what i want.
ok, change shirts with me.
you can dish it out, but you can not take it.
I am certainly not going to do it myself.
yes, I am bringing darryl.
this is important.
case closed.
"... to remain friends.
no, i do not!
that is outrageous!
no.
because you have no skills.
I am friends with everybody in this office.
first off, i want you to be comfortable, because you really can not grieve if you are all tight and buttoned up.
i want you to enjoy that cake because i have something terrible  i need to tell you.
oh, it is on, phyllis, it is so on!
no, i want you to pick me up.
sorry?
well, shame on you.
keep it in your pants.
do not think a woman can be a man?
it is okay.
so from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, i am sorry.
excellent!
i want you to write down everything that people are doing all day.
okay, ryan.
earlier today.
have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the mormon church?
what is this contraption, i do declare?
you are second mate.
why are we here?
you know what?
hypothetically, if i were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means?
okay, this is the fine work award.
um.
it is fifty degrees outside.
i, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
oh.
really nice job.
well, when you least expect it, expect it.
thanks for your help.
you know what?
i did not want to cast a pall over our fun beach day.
what is wrong?
with the eye patch.
i could not sleep last night.
you missed my song, buddy.
why do i have to do everything?
you are moving... to the annex.
brought you some balloons.
get set.
you guys got it soft, and cushy!
so... holly's my family now.
because i am so angry over all of this.
good luck.
and that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor.
and we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it.
if you do not get no respect, you might be redneck.
that is the difference between you and i.  business is not about money to me, david.
and i am never, ever going to leave.
um, I am  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand.
i pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." open-mindedness, is that even a word?
he wrapped his belt around his own neck.
but you know what?
you know what the problem is?
thank you.
you have to tell him what you did.
his salary, that would depress them.
you have got it, you have got it.
yes, yes.
everybody, i want you to look at holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what i see in her.
she has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in scottsdale.
oh, my god.
come on.
scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day?
can you confirm that the straps are tight?
well, it is not a little foggy there is actually something going on here- do i?
domo arigato, mr. scott-of.
no, i do, i, i wear men's suits, ok?
do you?
pam, clearly, has just given up trying.
okay, well we will work on it.
how there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but what the hell everybody!?
something to work toward, being here more.
at a gas station?
how are you doing, man?
all right, let us head out.
okay.
hello.
and today, both darryl and i took something.
alright.
walk with me.
he is not your five year old brother, dwight.
okay, since this is the disputed poster.
and her boyfriend will die.
soda.
really?
i am michael scott.
no.
i know.
um... no, we are not married... yet!
my lips are sealed.
oh!
you are right.
oh!
thank you doctor.
okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us?
if you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.
sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man dwight just to see what was shakin'.
next person on the... ...calendar.
oh god... okay alright.
what?
jim, do not take this the wrong way.
thank you for your time, and drive safe.
oh, oh, oh!
um... tell me.
you know what they say, keep your friends close.
you are not.
I am taking him out to lunch because i can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
oh... here we go!
you know, david.
we are very excited too, are not we guys?
jim, you are in charge.
can not really trust my feelings anymore.
my compliments to the chef.
but someday i think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids... all right.
i need to purchase something.
and scene.
oh, i have gifts as well!
you want to go for a ride?
all right.
hey, what is going on here?
that is my foot.
the 'michael' all cursive, the 'scott' all caps.
can i kiss you?
that is not what wallace told us.
what i want to do right now is try something a little different.
there is no such things as monsters.
everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I would like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes.
and that way, we will be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored.
half an hour.
i have a small problem.
i do not need the woods.
oh, look at that.
darryl, what is your biggest fear?
it is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title.
no, i will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
do i have what it takes?"  and i think we both know the answer.
try my googi, googi.
back to the future?
we are following pam to the supply shelf.
oh.
classic gang only.
nope, nope, nope.
all good suggestions.
they look cute.
pam, you are trustworthy- and a woman- and i want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.
well... okay, i was just kind of getting it going.
what are... what are you doing?
i liked my lunch.
you guys would love it.
why did not i get it?
that was not a shake, dwight.
i can give you an extra laptop battery.
okay.
why pay more to sit next to old tranny claus over there, when you can sit on my lap.
just trying to be your friend.
all right?
you can make another dress that goes past your feet.
it is not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
danny, i want you to look at me.
every single last one of them.
oh, ho, ho, ho.
it is not like gay... shame festival.
so i killed, almost.
could have used some of that famous hispanic cleaning ethic.

let me see  them.
hold on, hold on.
no, no.
rumors.

ah yeah, that is nice.
i do not need to tell you that.

oh, sorry, mate.
all right, yep.
alright?
why do not you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what is your cell?

jan is at home.

what... all right!
jim i need that thing stat!
so it is not a free fall?
my last pay check?
just sit there and think about michael jackson.
everything's going to be fine.
okay.
those are the ad guys right there.
alright, I will do it.
all right.
and i grabbed this suit.
we are going to make karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
he put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams.
come on!
thank you.
why?
well i think we are past that now.
he is... you know what?
all right, come on down meredith!
i know.
what is that?
does anybody out there have intuition?
hey!
done deal.
no... cleaning... up.
need somebody else.
really?
no.
turns out meredith has been exposed to rabies.
just up here, getting used to the altitude.
not in my house.
it is such a stereotype.
hey, hey, hey stop it.
maybe I am hindu after all.
...it is a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies.
dwight, oh ho, dwight, dwight, my loyal compadre.
am i wrong?
400, 400 hey batter batter.
this is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.
right over here, let me show you this.
ahh!
we all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like dunder mifflin... are going to fall by the wayside.
gruel.
nana.
party's over?
rollercoaster ride!
all right.
hey!
you are right.
and i will be taking questions.
and you must always wear the safety mittens.
what does a great manager need most of all?
great.
oh, ok.  why did not you call me?
i would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to jan about what happened between us.
cock in the henhouse.
star trek.
you do?
you are what, like, 12?
i made a family!
this is a little something for you to remember your time here in scranton by.
poor people love pizza.
it is okay.
so if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, i am the captain.
yeah, i just remembered that i have to go to the bathroom.
okay, no, you encouraged it.
what?
people are mixing, a lot of hope.
if there is one thing i hate more than the mafia it is a liar.
gimmme, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
halpert.
he is tall and yellow and very nice.
and they are all worried about their jobs, you know.
oh my god.
sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
then i guess i should give them out.
oh, oh it is awful.
jazz people know who he is.
um... andy.
we still do not know who the murderer is.
no he is not right.
that is the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
there are four kinds of business: tourism.
oh, you sigh like january i broke jan's heart, david, and it was awful.
here we go!
mmm-kay.
What are you doing?
I will talk to him.
very good, nice doing business with you.
except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, i need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
did you also know that china has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal.
yeah.
my other boss, mr. figaro.
i can not serve you.' she might have been.
I am michael scott.
thankfully.
alright.
willing to prove himself now.
also he is divorced so he is really not a part of his family.
are we too cool?
what?
anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list.
this is creed, and he is in charge of... something.
and in this case i think we are celebrating me.
and, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.
uhhh... blow out the candle.
is that like the robot?
shirty, mole, lazy eye, mexico, baldy.
you know why?
ooh.
I am not going to lock my door.
come on.
early worm gets the worm.
oh, i still have more.
and before that happens i need to get laid.
okay, let me tell you a little story.
how... how did he take it?
well, thank you... thank you a lot.
what did you do?
hey.
'scuse me.
slow and steady.
for 300 dollars to me!
they are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, michael scott is freaking cool.
really?
smokin' doobies.
I am doing it.
i need this job.
and now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can not be peeing all over the walls.
come on.
hey goldenface.
so check out how we live they call it scranton!
paper money.
ah!
there needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat.
there are certain defining moments in a person's life.
i am going to go with the best, january i am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
hey, i hired them!
no you are not!
i watch, queer as f***, so... what?
thank you.
but i do want to talk to you about something.
he has the award-ah!
his chair at his desk.
that is a good point.
well, bigshot, 'if you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
hey, nice to meet you.
of course, if you beat us, you are fired.
i do not know either.
kelly.
that is impressive.
what?
no, this is romantic.
oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
so I am thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live.
that is great and we still have most of our stuff.
here we go.
i just had the best, most romantic week of my life in sandals, jamaica.
actually looks bigger with people in it.
here we go, knock, knock.
good.
pam, would you smell my breath?
you should be teaching me.
i did not, i did not know.
dogfighting.
okay, no, no, no, no.
i have not signed them, ok?
yes.
the problem is that i am the boss and apparently i can not say anything.
well... i do not know if that is a good idea.
oh!
it did not.
you know what guys, she will be out of the bathroom soon.
dwight is an idiot.
you forgetting something?
dwight!
i did, indeed.
that is easy.
no, no!
i am.
great twist.
you are head-hunted.
it is.
i am here to tell ya.
why am i so sad?
i do not want to fire stanley.
okay, all right.
badda bing, badda boom.
it is not even to "y".
a.j.
toby, just do it!
um, before i tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
please i told you to get rid of the cell phones.
oh, creed... is the old guy over there.
not about taking credit.
worth a try.
i was with jan for so long.
yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company.
how would that help creed?
whoo!!
i am going to throw you this ball.
hey, I would rather kill myself.
thank you.
and then i had an awakening.
you can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
jan is calling me.
if you think that is going to have any effect on me, it will not.
too much information.
i can not go back.
oh!
so!
yeah, kay.
idiot!
are you sure?
she hit me?
whoa there you are, i did not see you there behind that grain of rice.
yeah, middle school's amazing.
you know what?
that was four years ago.
i do not know, your frame, your build-why do not you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you are not a diabetic.
oh.
the show's not over.
i forgot about packer.
no, that is enough.
and they have no arms or legs.
yeah, just this whole toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
had to come in on a saturday.
i do.
this here is savannah.
works like a charm.
do you, donna, by any chance shop at victoria's secret?
why well, if you had not stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
blow for luck!
actually, kevin, you might like it!
um, why do not you wait in my office.
that was great.
yeah.
oh!
yes, hello mr. flax this is michael scott, your daughter's boss.
and at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab." i do.
good good.
you have to agree with me.
hoo-ooh!
well, i know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did i...and the only reason i got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
oh, copy that breaker.
it is sad, though, because i had a great summer.
margaret the land lady?
no, i mean afghanistanis with aids.
yes i do.
holly... you know, if we hung holly from the ceiling, we would have to kiss underneath of her.
it is sort of our perk!
it is set our industry back quite a bit.
where?
this is spinning out of control, pam.
kelly, i want you to stand up on your chair.
no.
okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.
you should have an m&amp;m, they are really good.
do i know what?
what is up?
that is my drakkar noir.
what does what mean?
I am already on the bus.
ah.
oh, after you.
to be safe i should learn everything about everything but i do not have time.
hello?
I am sorry.
give me the ball!
for you... jerk.
no flowers for us.
nobody cares what you think.
ok. hey you guys.
i used to be in hr.
and... also, phyllis, stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
um, not everything means something, it is just a joke.
let me get this clear!
can not we all just get along?
do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy?
come on, come on.
400-450  sold!
wow.
hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if i were to ask you?
no, I am going to have the gourmet hot dog.
fine.
i just... right.
i knew that.
boom!
no.
solamente en espanol, por favor.
hedded take hedded of.
andy, you go.
now these are limes, lemons, onions... oh, yuck.
maxim?
let us just say we all did it.
um...thanks for listening, those who listened.
yeah, but i destroyed it, it is not even useable anymore.
i want to break up with january wow, i cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
and then i met helene.
I am thinking roy?
movie monday!
okay.
i said no.
this is a damn shame, but we are like a family here and that just, that will not fly.
luke, seriously.
jell-of!
because you got a good life!
here we go.
put it on your fore... do not look at the card.
with dissatisfied clients, it does not matter what you did.
she will have a greekaccino.
did anybody see a package here today?
gays are not necessarily who you think they are, people.
and know what i did?
what?
holly?
curse is broken.
good.
we have nowhere else january this... ok, ok, fine.
dwight.
I am not giving that to you.
they inherit things through the breast milk.
ah, yes.
do not take it out.
i learned a lot about women today.
would she get into trouble?
you know what?
oh, okay.
no, no, no, I will talk to her.
yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks.
we have jim.
oh, that is not, yeah I am not... ok... so you get the rent checks every month and what happens next?
question, should i get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
i was thinking , you know andy is having a seminar today?
now see, that is not so hard, right?
i think it is going to be any minute now.
throw them away in the recycling bin.
does she ever mention 'michael scott?' does it feel good?
we regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment.
no, computron, actually i think cooper's is the best.
not in a speech.
oh!
are there any questions?
ohh!
huu, what do you think?
not the way i taught you!
you got burned, because packer's back!
that is part of my job as regional manager.
jim, please no loopholes.
well, that is how we do it in scranton.
nothing happened.
this is wrong!
five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.
come on, it will be fun.
the scranton strangler is.
i have taken a unique part of who you are, and i have used that to memorize your name.
oh, wow.
it is the perfect way to start the day.
no, just power it down.
that is what I am talking about.
he would land on his feet.
i like donna.
i had a fish stick sandwich.
just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
have it your way.
happy bird-day.
barbeque at jim's tonight.
i do not- oh my god.
toast!
which type are not you are not?
there is a lotta pressure on me right now.
twelve miles an hour.
because i want to play ball with my kids before i get too old.
buckle up.
let us face it, most guys are from the dark ages.
i do not know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I am sure that it was clove cigarettes.
and you know what?
ah, what is hanging?
no.
so why do-- it... folds up.
let us celebrate.
i have been here a bunch of times, so i know where everything is, know everybody's names.
it is weird.
that is hilar... oh, god!
a sensitive email has been released to the office.
i want to break up with january wow.
so i wanted to give you that.
why?
get this... kevin thought i was going to sell my bowflex for 200 dollars and i told him 'dude this was a prop in my movie.' ok it is because we have not sold anything.
come on down here.
i was just going to...  i was going to talk to holly, about her hygiene.
oh, why do i feel like crap?
so... right.
do you agree about what?
was i?
yes.
the dealio of life.
no... uh, also, because that is your alma mater.
that is... horrifying.
david wallace told me!!
I am going to cwall jan revinson-gould.
okay.
kelly.
and it was either living with myself or... being happy.
so... jan and i are lovers.
i love you, new york!
kinky!
toby flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry.
no, no, no, i finished all of that.
okay.
ready?
go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
uh.
yeah, baby!
uh, yes.
really?
anything.
this is a little gift bag for you.
just, you know, find it.
I have got two tickets to paradise!
is it a group of people?
i will not sell.
they do not have cookies like the girl scouts.
hello.
not at all.
"okay?"  we used to go for "pretty good." yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.
well, the clock says chatting time, so.
i do not know you.
in nature, there is something called a food chain; it is where the shark eats a little shark.
alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
'wow!
oh, oh, almost dropped you!
oh, boy.
what is the deal with grapenuts?
that is the image, i think we can all agree is very disgusting.
do not look down.
and i do not even care who wins.
the plo, the ira, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse.
jim?
and that is why, i am going to jump off this roof!
what is it going to be?
so what, if we have to stay late to do inventory?
ah, right here.
ok?
would you like a sandwich?" these people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.
well, times have changed.
wow.
now open your eyes.
it is intimidation mostly, it is the awareness that they are not me.
so check out how we live they call it scranton.
let it fly.
kevin.
that was the news.
laying a base.
reverse psychology is an awesome tool.
i will cover his ass like moss on a mississippi tree stump.
oh the anti-christ!
stop pam-m-s-ing.
what is happening?
give me the phone.
no, toby is terrible.
mike myers, genius.
god!
I am an adult, i do not have to think or do anything.
okay, everybody here?
because nobody here is willing to help me.
well, we all know it is hard to be a boss, right?
no cuts.
ok, you know something, dwight?
and i am like the cool teacher.
okay... I am going to toss the ball to pam.
what are...?
you have a bad imagination.
wow.
you know what, here is the thing about die hard 4. die hard one, the original, john mcclane was just this normal guy.
count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
for what?
maybe.
we could go back and forth all day.
right there.
i spent all morning on it.
good stuff.
okay.
just... try to be cool.
that-that was maybe too much.
that is it.
yes, of course.
oh.
it is going to work very smoothly, because pam and ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from michael scott paper company and- no, you lost those clients.
whoa.
yeauck.
packer.
how is traffic?
we are here to not judge you.
let us hear it for darryl and his band.
very cool, very cool.
okay.
well, you do not even have anyone to go home to, toby.
okay?
we have bubba gump shrimp, red lobster down there.
well, you know what phyllis?
do not worry about phil.
hi, I am michael scott, dunder-mifflin.
which is it more of?
how about later in the week?
i do not want to appear ungrateful for everything sabre's doing for us.
you are the best.
you have to just push it out!
horrible.
i dunno.
i want to come to work.
look at the outside of this building.
we already have that.
yeppers.
all right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
like everybody else.
okay, here is the thing about january she talks such a big game about, "oh there is nothing between us and stop talking about it." and "border-line harassment when you call me at home." but let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on valentine's day?
one.
i will see you this weekend for the penguins.
i just have not hugged you in awhile oh, good.
i wished for jan to get over me.
alright.
what does that even mean?
you can keep that.
there is no movie called willy wonka.
oh.
well, you kept- going into nuclear something; that is not where the scene was going.
hey.
i literally- i put no thought into the wrapping at all.
oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation.
you know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
uh, stanley is having a stroke.
all right?
close your eyes.
who wants to fix up .. toby.
alright?
"too soon for arabs." maybe next year.
everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.
if somebody does not tell me, I am going to start screaming.
can not talk, saving the planet.
i do not really know what to say.
oh, yeah.
there was a show called 'fundle bundle' and i was the star.
good.
i always think better when it is cooler.
we had some fun.
pam, pam- I am really sorry.
we had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
it is a 45 day/45 point.
okay... yes.
all right.
dwight.
and now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts... ...the "busiest beaver" award goes to phyllis lapin.
not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.
that my friend, is your victory.
he worked at that telemarketing place.
wait, you still do not know... you still do not know.
this place is freaking awesome!
okay.
i can tell.
let me show you how this works.
that is what she said!
it will not.
it is the best.
hey!
baby carriage.
what happened?
okay, you know what?
the other branch managers are total morons.
toby can i see those?
tah, come on dwight.
it is an awesome place.
let us give him a minute to settle in, shall we?
oh, wow, sleeper hold.
respect.
that is weird.
yeah.
a ten inch black and white?
now i need a plural noun.
so I am... okay, well, we will figure something.
the stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
now, we are getting three people each.
oh.
terrific.
he is kidding.
a fairy princess.
not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
i am going to call and find out... I am just going to call her.
and if you so much as harm a hair on stanley's head, we will burn utica to the ground.
what can i do?
but they did not complete their task, pam!
senor, are you happy with your-- have you-- have you considered satellite television?
you go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
case closed.
in the end.
life is good.
twenty-six.
try my googi, googi.
james halpert.
i just, i need something kind of embarrassing, you know.
not too big, not too small.
cri-man-squa.
okay.
well, people hear a lot of things, man.
i understand that he did not receive the promotion.
and your ebony tower.
i need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
no.
this will only take a second of your time.
lurk much?
so you have it right?
um, cool.
oscar, got big plans tonight with- kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?
no, you said something, did not you?
you told me, that i lead a... cushy, wimpy, nerf life.
you were playing too.
like, with who?
i really can not say.
the gabba-gool.
they have one of those?
yeah.
you are not going to lose them.
yep.
on your left!
what is wrong with you people?
the grim reaper is here.
and then i call froggy 98.7, the request line.
okay i just cancelled my afternoon.
oh that i plagiarized i think.
well, they are good snacks.
no?
how much do they want?
dwight!
it is called willy wonka and the chocolate factory.
yep, yech... no.
business is always personal.
"hi.
please.
only other people.
so?
what... what is that?
nice to meet you.
it has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
all right.
that will damage ya.
pull up next to each other, give each other the finger... moon each other.
and right now, out there, they are all denying the fact that they are sad.
very, very sublime.
really?
that last thing they did was great.
thanks, bye.
i have a girlfriend so... yeah she probably, yeah she would be.
the office.
let us just crawl out of here together.
buildings here in scranton are literally powered by coal.
just put it on.
no.
i got west nile virus, lost a ton of weight.
scranton is not lame.
t-no.
what do we got?
i know you did not intend to, but i just i got the idea and i, uh, i just do not it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something.
what, what happened?
i have my book on business, somehow i manage.
mikanos and... okay.
right?
comes with a shampoo and blow dry.
no, it is in like ten minutes.
i can not tell you, so... nothing, pam.
just about everyone in this office is single right now.
okay?
i want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
oh, you know what?
do not-all right.
that is a car that can talk.
josh porter, high five.
sure we do.
wrong.
okay fine, i get it.
did i say that?
not necessarily.
so, how do i do that?
do not - do not do that.
we did not get it.
oh, we are playing phone tag.
try and destroy the old ways, gabe, well i will not let you.
boom.
dwight.
160. uh, just a few more items.
very good.
that?
got to be a lot better than a deathbed.
it is spppplllibbb no, here is the thing.
that would take precedence and i would expect your support.
you know, this office sort of has a perfect feng shui to it, so... you know, let us not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I am still here- i still have to look at this stuff, guys.
it is surprising, um... because you did not expect it.
christmas is awesome.
no, i got it.
holly, carol, january helene?
let us get back to the matter at hand.
goodbye tooo-by!
give us some time to catch up, and... ay, kay.
classic.
your job is to make the office lame.
okay then who wants to watch the rest?!
i have not been squeezing it.
i need something fun.
I am sure whatever you did it was not your fault.
still my office, ryan.
ok, dwight.
it is up to you to change his mind.
we are only 10 minutes from the lake.
today i ended up seeing a lot of women that i used to date, and in my mind they were all great.
i just do not want you to.
i got to them.
did i motivate you?
so... no, toby, damn it, come on!
ok, good good, so we will just all go down there together at lunch.
not pam.
but the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
uh-huh.
can you believe it?
something to win their affections back.
come on.
so, the next call we get I would like you to smile.
sits on a copier.
so if you think you are hurting... oh, wow look at those.
that is such a scam!
it is not the only drug that speeds people up.
mr. franklin, i would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
i, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
i just looked a man in the eyes and i shook his hand.
you do like hard boiled eggs and i got one a those melon ballers  and i, it is just like a little ice cream scoop, and i just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.
no, you were not stupid.
i am not being sexist.
I am sorry, could i have your attention, please.
parkoooooour!
ok, here we go.
so how much are we going to lose?
because phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as santa.
hey, josh, how ya doing?
ok, 1 sikh, and... you spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.
no, i did not.
it is just a really important day for me.
i feel like it but i am not going to.
okay, everybody come on.
you know what?
that file had been falsified.
what?
just let me do it!
what i respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how antz was just a rip-off of a bug's life, he stayed true to his films.
we have been thinking about where packer should sit... and we can not just sit around and wait for creed to die.
they are in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right?
man, i know how you feel.
i thought your name was pudge?
no, no, that does not make any sense.
he scores.
types; result pops up] oh my god, wow!
all aboard for sales!
okay.
was it the cleavage?
can you believe it?
i wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from men in black.
um, no, not... no.
and sometimes i can be too invested in my job.
hey, look at me, I am a baby!
america.
both.
jim and karen are here, which is cute.
we need someone who is actually made a sale.
your face.
okay.
i was in that marriage arena, though.
alright, come on.
yshhyah.
answer, maybe, but maybe not.
okay.
here you go.
we are going to make a statement.
what.
pow!
you can sleep up top.
just-what is going on?
i listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
okay shut up.
it is always a treat when <i>our</i> paths cross.
i insist.
you know when they say it is so crazy it just might work?
snack attack time.
oh, no.
yeah.
no more conflict.
boo!
ohh... ok. i know why she is calling.
no, no, no.
got it.
wikipedia... is the best thing ever.
hey, buttercup.
that is not funny.
although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
oh... oh, and you have a woody.
ok. thank you, stanley.
i am going to be... kind of a daddy.
carry on.
you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand.
i know.
dwight, dwight... football is like rock and roll, it is just bam-bam-boo... and basketball is like jazz, you know?
and thus, michael scott sealed his own destiny.
my biggest fear is turning into him.
do not.
no, that was- I am just getting into the first act.
dwight.
five of the clock sharp.
do you think that this is a game?
ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
yes my hero!
black people love pizza.
did you have a... did you like your lunch?
and you know what i think is the most attractive part of a woman's body?
go, go, go!
well, me too, I have done something stupid which i would like to share.
you know what the craziest part of this is?
is this what you are saying, grasshopper?
no!
yes.
shuffle up and deal.
good news.
dunder mifflin is about to be sold.
it is just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.
this is too important.
okay.
yes, yes.
when you got transferred, and i drove you up to nashua, you said, "michael, i love you, but i can not do this." but then, with this other guy, you do not have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you?
you will not die!
but i did see jan there.
ah.
even if he does not, i would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway.
mmwa.
so everybody has a different race.
what is that?
dwight, no.
now, who likes dane cook?
so what?
stanley?
kev...  nice.
pretty funny, huh?
it is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty.
guys, guys.
she is an anorexatic.
i mean, you have got it all.
three, two, one.
what am i going to do with a removed uterus?
and within each clue is a lesson.
they are on a date.
that intern we had a few years ago.
he was... he had an inability to communicate, shall i say?
but you know what, meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.
hey scott!" oh, oh, i was just watching that.
i have something i would like to give you.
woo!
money's no object.
and it rhymes, and if it is not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp.
thanks.
adolf hitler.
could i stay in your room tonight?
and it is my second favorite movie.
so we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
up.
we are all a family, right?
oh, shiii... ladies and gentleman, for the first time as a couple, mr. and mrs. bob vance.
lampshade on head!
it could be a pedestrian.
rain check?
higher salaries.
the merenator, sleepin' with suppliers!
i did say i would, but i was wrong.
can he do it?
no.
like, watch this.
all right!
and you know what?
and i am street smart.
i want a sebring.
no dwight, not everything is a threat.
sorry to interrupt.
no.
this is about doing, not thinking.
drama.
and i am the regional manager of dunder-mifflin, michael scott.
where is my numbers man?
do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody?
i am chandler and joey and, uh, pam is rachel.
i have plans that night.
how is it going?
two points, three points, four points.
it is time for grapes.
i sold it on ebay.
yes.
yeah, that sounds amazing.
no one's even going to notice.
and in real life it is disgusting.
who wants to give it a shot?
oh... well... stop it!
wuh... come on, january this is important.
the man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
pop that in.
jim, you are 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, gumby has a better body than you.
in jamaica, i took one.
you sent him cards?
ok. kevin is a great guy.
i share my birthday with eva longoria.
yes, but you had me so worked up that i made a mistake.
fire you?
sir, would you do the honor?
co-ed naked strippers in this office.
oh, I am just so sorry that i threw the thing out.
wow.
so see you later.
i will grab you here anyway.
because i like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
all right, everybody... oh my god, pam, those make you look so ugly.
oh, really?
god!
part of my busy day, you know.
found log." "10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points." that is on the wrong page.
i see you have met computron, our virtual helper.
god.
maybe there is prizes?
um, pam.
I am like mr. miyagi and yoda rolled into one.
yeah.
na... no.
oh, somebody is got a new phone!
please.
well, who is that one?
why would you say that?
no!
kevin, do you accept the apology?
fresh and new.
you are good, they know it.
okay, okay, phyllis this is what i want you to do.
yes, listen, um...  you cannot tear stanley from his family like this.
oscar, homosexual accountant.
it is not amazing... at all.
i am not old.
meredith, you have slept with so many guys you are starting to look like one.
like a cow thing.
I would like to go around the room and have us each express to meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.
oscar, what were you going to say?
explain that.
okay.
i thought i did.
some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
what am i supposed to do with this?
but the next day they feel great.
it is complicated, pam.
we were joking around.
so... what is, um... what you eating?
anyway, it is a tragedy, really, because the paint is not going to come off the dog until it sheds... so... well.
yes who?
oh, god!
I am going to have you listen while i steal your biggest client.
just... yeah.
and it just stopped.
so why do not you just go stand somewhere else.
i work too hard.
give me the bottle!
say hi to pam!
sorry your party's so lame.
step up.
you are cheating on me.
and if somebody were to be bait it would be jim.
ok. no, no, shhhhut it.
oh my god, dwight.
you hear stories about dunder mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was.
that is... a psyche.
so let us go!
i give them money.
paul newman, robert redford.
and, um, one down.
and i want it someday, but just in the future.
are you going to make another pro and con list?
go to him.
give me the phone.
no, i got it at tj maxx, four dollars.
also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
"you are foir-ed."  i think if i had a catchphrase it would be, "you are hired, and you can work here as long as you want." but that is unrealistic, so... get set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott.
that is a nice attitude, ryan, I am just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
everyone seems to get along!
you know, i will be honest with you... about something.
no more knock-knock jokes.
pam, pam!
i just want to be treated normally today.
let us do.
let us go!
so I am back.
or a woman.
hr pufnstuf.
i guess i get it.
all right.
I will call her later.
no this is holly.
and home is where the hardest.
'k?
do you know that?
you know?
i, just... play fair, you know, play fair.
i tried, i tried.
nope.
and I am surprised that you did not question me in the first place.
all right, next suggestion.
here we go!
good speech ryan, you are a good guy.
my mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better.
and he is also clever.
I am going to skip forward to a relevant clue.
toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and i am now his cruise director, and my name is captain bruisin'.
but, i am not going to take this lying down.
by the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I have forgotten about?
but we are going to let this one slide.
yeah, a little bit.
i can not do this.
i love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved.
never missed a day, my ass.
goldenface, this makes it personal.
now is really not the time, meredith.
try "profits".
i am already walking.
alright.
no.
what are you going to do if you are by yourself and your heart stops?
like tide.
i know.
I am just walking around.
well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame.
okay.
you would hate it.
it is like, a girl says she will make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
I am in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton... keep the camera steady please!
i am going to give you a raise.
come on stanley.
oh.
is josh funnier than i am?
somebody help her.
what i do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
charging.
ok... meredith,  ooooohhhhh.
see, have not lost my sense of humor.
ok. yes.
no, dwight.
follow me!
and you are okay with that?
that 's bull crap.
and then it needed a second santa.
so um... i think I am going to go back with darryl  okay.
ummm-hmmm... very easy to clean.
no, today at work.
hmm, well that is interesting darryl.
good.
chapter one.
that is all.
forgiveness is next to godliness.
oh!
figure out carpools.
day 44, go.
i probably will, why do you ask?
okay, you know what?
no, no.
okay.
why do not you want to go tonight?
dwight and i are going to the big thing.
and we are in.
so, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the mcdreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he is in love with her... really?
what?
ok, you know what?
i bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.
he goes to bed early.
it might be an accident.
you bring dip?
hey, that looks good.
what?
good to see you again.
we are not in the playground anymore.
sure.
and i hope you are as gracious during this next part.
get on down here!

it has to bother you.
um, yeah, no, well... i mean better.
we always invited them.
here we go.
hi.
i do okay.
no!
well, you know, money is not everything jim.
could he help us with some parking tickets?
come on.
ohh, i do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what i have to tell you.
i will tell you there has been work everyday.
hi, sorry.
I am sorry.
and now he is probably going to get fired for it.
right here.
that is over $200 a year.
yeah.
you know what, we are going to tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
...danny glover.
alotta rules.
yeah, do not do that.
pull it over.
you know what, holly?
and I am looking for some talented salesmen to join me.
you know, we are going to have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
let us keep it moving!
yes.
just the woman I would like to see.
i wanted to pay for your education.
they need this game, jim.
oh.
what the hell?
do you know what I am referring to?
how did you know that?
look at me, phyllis!
how are ya?
i buy them from discount stores... or on ebay.
man, they got us so bad.
thanks.
and it is terrible.
what?
and if a friend can not make you feel good, then i do not want any friends.
totally your call babe.
that was good!
hey!
far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
i will don it... and oh!
cool, so maybe hook me up  with some fleebulls and some hive.
hello, hello.
and she took a bite, started to choke.
i did!
yes?
thank you.
he is just good.
john favreau, tall guy from dodgeball.
what?
we have a little song prepared for you.
we tell them the plan, right?
kevin!
it is football cream.
oh, no, everybody; oscar's gone crazy!
do you think you are taking it a little... literally, dwight?
guilty.
that is what she said.
let us go.
here comes stanley!
thank you, dwight.
i know, i know.
you know what guys?
yep, i did.
i just want you to treat him like my nephew.
the point is, do not listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
you scared?
see?
so, kevin and creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
you guys looks great.
thanks a bunch.
I am going to be thinking about how many friends i have, and my children, and my comedy albums.
umm... let us see... choo choo choo.
packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, andy.
jan?
pam, i do my best work when people do not believe in me.
i need you to go back to bed.
god.
gah.
are you eating popcorn?
no, no, no.
and i am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.
that phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
that is what she said.
i can not prove it but i think she might be trying to poison me.
he is ruin... he is butchering it.
i want you to know.
okay, rude.
i understand.
yes.
ach!
i did not say it!
I am right here.
the winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
see ya in a bit.
so, deangelo!
new website, blah blah blah.
actually, i think roy is their best player not lonny.
thanks.
you know, here is the thing.
100 dollars, great.
she was wrong.
those have been my goals ever since i heard that song.
yeah, pam.
that is what he said!
you know what?
that is not nice.
let us see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
no!
"michael, buy a motorcycle." so i put the money in my shoe, and then i forgot about it until now.
good.
that is adorable.
no, his work family.
thanks.
you talkin' to me?
did you know that in china there are fifty six cities with over a million people?
ugh!
oh those are the best.
well, okay... and andy, andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman.
guys, look.
ok. put them on speaker.
yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
hey, you know what?
rrrr.
how do you know that?
oh, well.
so, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want.
guys, let me ask you something.
sign the papers at the condo.
like the old lady from titanic.
i am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
because, I am not-I am not... I am not going to be in town.
now studies show that today's woman, the ally mcbeal woman, as i call her, is at a crossroads... no, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.
so let us get cracking.
oh, oh!
if she is not engaged, in all honesty, i may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness.
congratulations karen.
with that i can buy... half the menu.
not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
am i going to ask for big, crying apology?
mom, I am getting married.
ed's tires, huh?
that is the fun of this place.
after all we have been through?
be cool!
ayyyy!
as my associate.
relax, spazzy boy.
i think i got something pretty nice for my guy.
yeah, i know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I am turning to you my friend.
from 2:30 to 3:15.  it is the only time that bob was available.
listen man, i, i got a problem, i think I am in trouble with the mob.
if you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
what do you mean though?
you are going to be my accomplice.
whatever you need, I am right on the other side of this wall.
it was ryan.
and i threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish.
what the hell is that?
boring.
you ready for this?
get a room santas!
I am not really sick.
everybody else is past it.
we are going to zone!
this is pathetic, is not it?
well, I will land on my feet.
everyone, now count down with me.
please?
"hidy ho, you sexy thang.
no, I am talking about your personality, dwight.
just try not to be too gay on the court.
rain check.
oh-kay.
i love that song.
oh... oh!
friday?
[everyone groans and girl turns around and walks away.
so when i heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, i thought  sorry.
uh-oh.
yeah.
it is just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor.
come on, you are obviously single.
number three, and this is a fact.
i do not get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids.
ok. ee... i was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
it is the most sacred and honored hindu holiday in the world.
oh, oh!
carmel dip.
i accept that.
it is a ram thing.
it is a big dream of mine.
where is the funny?
huh?
i just need a minute, okay?
do not touch the food.
over the shirt, my elbow, but... um, yup, wait, yes.
mm-hmm.
angela where is angela?
you saw the plaque, right?
kelly, you are hindu, so you believe in buddha.
no, i do not think so.
just make that copy okay?
i have been a loyal employee for a long time.
this one is with a little twist.
contraption!
well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the gilligan thing, so... right now, i was thinking.
does anyone need to smell my old carpet?
pizza by alfredo.
nobody?
aaaaaaaa!
oh, well, I am glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I am down here it does not seem too busy to me.
that is smart.
that is disgusting.
sounds pretty good, right?
i think you are really going to enjoy it down there.
we have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
frankly, you have a job because ryan and pam are starting with us as salesmen.
let us go.
i wish todd packer was here because he would love this.
phyllis!
of course we are going to have a party.
just know that if i could have fired you, i would have.
no, of course you did not.
i have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign.
it looks like there is going to be downsizing.
yeah.
walking through fire!
right?
i want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and i share after i have passed on to new york.
you got to do something- how much time do you think you will need?
god!
okay.
that is a shawl.
well, why have i been separating the trash into whites and colors?
i am going to give you... $25.
traitor.
i still try to be a friend first, but... you know?
I am telling you, all i will need are my instincts and my will to survive.
it is show time!
sort of bat clean up and- that is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
oh do not.
kelly!
did you see what... wow-wee!
it just says "creed." let us hear an opening bid, everybody.
all right, this is it.
yankee swap!
they are beautiful.
that is just not the way a dunder mifflin manager should go, I am sorry.
that is not big picture.
god, yeah... ah!
today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
very nice.
do you have a coat?
well, might be a ride home.
that was very nice of him.
so I will just think of something else to say.
let us put a pin in it for now.
come on, get in here and have the baby.
whew.
umm... this one says chair model... that sounds good.
what do you want me to do tonight?
no.
that was a very good point.
ten, ten months?
I am going to be in mexico for my half-birthday.
what do i look like to you, paul newman?
you are not a veterinarian.
please.
tell... tell her, i ran out for cash.
i think i know where he is.
wait a minute.
and because you are gettin' old.
that is cool.
wait, wait, wait, come, i just, i just want to know why?
well it sounds right, but is it?
have not you seen ghostbusters, pam?
creed, you are teeth called, your breath stinks.
i do not understand.
right there.
ok, alright, enough with the jokes.
and finally, to... a quitter.
i just do not want you to lie to me.
have i slept with a woman?
you are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "nummies," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widiculous," and "wode iwand." you can not be a baby in the office.
it is for a good because.
my girls.
I am hurt, i have hurt myself.
okay.
you are so welcome, mon.
i stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt.
and now, presenting...  yes, i am.
this goes to stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.
i... really want to keep you.
i walked into the wrong building!
hi, I am just going to get this for a sec... just a sec.
i know.
in... films.
it is very simple.
well... that is random.
jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is jim and pam... and me.
!" bail'er?
please put on your blindfolds.
do i need to be liked?
come on down!
jan levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which i have a vested interest.
do you understand?
why?
what does that even mean?
you are not his friend, you do not know.
thank you roy.
and you might want to develop a couple of characters.
500. get lost.
front row.
no, no, no.
geesh, dwight!
ok!
no.
pam!
one for me one for january you guys should come over for dinner.
here we go.
whoo!
beow!
much advice you seek.
do not you dare.
i could have done better.
you know what.
he is hard of -- he is an old man.
you misconstrued me.
everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other... si senor.
still not seeing the problem here.
what?
free underwear!
have a seat.
"k" karen.
no this is holly.
do i rent devil wears prada again?
it is sort of hard to describe, but really its- it is a coming together... it is a surprise party for people who are- who have addictions.
my whole life i believed that america was number one, that was the saying.
you know what we need to do?
it is... it is very courageous, very exciting.
that, that, then why would, why would i not like that?
i call the middle!
number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it.
i still would have seen it, but that is not... the point.
i am going to buy a sweater.
they taste so good in my mouth.
yeah, but it is not brain cancer.
okay, so dig this: you are on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
still have my job in scranton, though.
i respect him because he reminds me of somebody.
you guys hungry?
nobody in here is suffering from depression.
that was the curse, stanley, and we are trying to find the because of the curse.
all right.
call poison control if you are bitten by a spider.
david told me.
it is not scary.
holly!
$645?!
and, uh, i know everybody says this, but i-i want to remain friends.
pam, i do not make the rules.
ed truck, who i liked, got decapitated.
you do not have to convince me.
I am ok. I am ok.  you guys... what are we going to do about jan?
it is not.
because i have, these memorization tricks that i use.
buddy, jimbo?
is this what i drink out of?
you honor them.
can i stay in your room tonight?
now this could be anything.
good.
it is from james bond.
what?
blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay?
lists are good.
and this is, do not tell me, martin... ne... ne...nack.
because she is not our customer anymore.
I will get the pizza!
talk!
because today, is the day that jim and pam become one.
we do not know if it is dead.
where is my go bag?
is josh busy?
it is for the time that i went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly.
runaway train, never come back.
it is a colonoscopy.
it is a club called chatroom, and there is a password to get in, which is actually password.
i never recommended you because i did not want to lose you and i did not want to lose pam,  and now i do not want to lose the baby.
i want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
looky-looky-looky.
right, right.
berp.
ed truck died.
wowweee.
who wants to help the world one step at a time?
yum!
if you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.
do you know anybody in the mob?
your food is no good here, my lady.
good.
because at dunder mifflin scranton, we are not just in the paper business, we are in the people business.
things get ruthless!
be careful what you wish for toby.
are not we great?
is he alright?
this is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours.
that was not what i was not, that was not... no.
i umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point.
and so on and so on.
yeah, definitely.
he is kind of a weirdo.
so... least i could do.
yes.
what is that thing that dwight always says?
wow.
bo banley.
so... okay... what?
like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
how do we stop it?
and, you want to take that away from me?
i just needed to hear your voice.
I am going to kill him.
which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what i just did for dwight.
you should have gotten credit for that, man.
so i could tell them apart.
stanley, you love your sudoku and your puzzles, i bestow upon you, my felt.
oh man, you seem to have caught jo's eye.
I am going to set my watch alarm... and... first thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of toby's going away party.
i want to show you some stuff.
i know.
like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion.
winning the lottery.
tonight has been one crazy night.
ok. alright, he is on his way up.
party central!
what is going on?
perfect.
oh, my god.
mmhmm, china.
i do not have eggs.
mmm... no.

you know, jan has my credit cards, and she is using them as if I am made of money, she thinks I am a human atm machine.
neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition.
like the movie, mean girls.
when they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that i had a good idea.
you will find love.
dwight will be driving me deep into the pennsylvania wilderness.
so costa rica that was - did you have fun?
you are not leaving.

airplane food.
no.

that is ok. this is bull****!
I am jesus, david, and you know why?
it is sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not i had them- okay, i think we are set.
ok, i want you to look at her.
a little friendly competition.
okay.
and you know why?
i auditioned for this.
na... yes.
it may be the person you least suspect.
but the best thing about it is that we are not going to have to give you any severance pay.
and that is what i thought that erin and kevin were going to find today...  i think I am going to be sick... hello hello.
ok.  healthier.
well, just shhhh... just just... look, i just... i do not understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
but, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.
da  na na na na.
i do not see how he can.
hello, everybody?
oh, hey temp.
i think we have done things a certain way here at dunder mifflin for quite some time, and - ok. i feel very strongly that you can not just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever.
okay.
ah, well maybe you should spy on him.
yes.
ah, the old "leave behind." oldest trick in the book.
no, no.
i think it is a success and I am the one who ended up with dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
i think we could.
thanks.
that is it?
it is how i like to do business, everybody joking around.
double or nothing.
mhm hm.
you ready?
how many of these are you familiar with?
that was a waste of time.
get that over here.
and this is erin and she is going to shave my face.
stand up, stand up, stand up.
we did not need them touching our asses.
well, we have learned that you can not teach an old dog new tricks, because it is illegal, and you will go to jail.
yes.
you would not arrest a guy who is just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
hey, did you miss that day there, ryan?
well, you said i looked thin, so what does... does that mean I am like thin weird or thin handsome or... yes, well, of course.
at this time, we are issuing a full recall of all sabre gh400 printers.
now as for bob... bob vance... is a guy that... he works... okay hold, hold on, hold on.
oh that so - that was really messy.
uh, because you have been on the lam?
when i was five, i imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn.
um.
just, i went to an alicia keys concert, over the weekend, and i think i may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
can you get it back?
please give me it.
being the boss is also about image.
hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video.
well, i guess this is it.
disruptive.

hello, stanley.
how?
i ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
my god, oscar.

i know, i know you have a phone policy.
oh!
my own.
i am flipping out, man.
holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself.
we kissed.
when you have somebody is attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and i experienced that firsthand today.
good, let us check that out.
well, could you tell me something that i did <i>right</i>?
okay.
um... i wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union.
is it?
see how i did that.
hey, you could transfer holly back from nashua.
he loves to surprise!
ask me.
what kind of toppings would you like?
what time we got?
so ironic.
yeah I am good.
so why do not you have everybody work on their expense reports and I would like them in by the end of the day.
so i thought we should have cpr training class and of course you can not get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it.
no, that is not... no, i went to the mall and i picked that out especially for you.
yeah.
push free play til tomorrow morning.
mmm-- mmm...  um... close the door.
yep?
we are office drones.
the person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.
so maybe i do understand.
i hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, i think our blood bags touched.
you told toby that creed has a distinct old man smell?
uh, pam?
all of you feel like my family.
"oscar.
too bad you did not have sex like seven and a half hours later.
want me to prove it to you?
of michael scott!
dwight, your feedback is horrible.
yes.
bill.

this part goes to the, uh, girl.
you learn a lesson, and then you find a lead.
we are very excited about the merger with sabre.
okay.

i have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
and i-- well that is ridiculous I am not going to make-- ah, so...  all right, levinson.
stop talking.
your kidding?!
i have some very great news from corporate.

the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
okay, all right.
give me a break, man.
you are dead, my friend!
i do not know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
oh, god!
do not, do not.
so... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire?
hello.
could ryan... tell ryan to bring toilet paper.
and they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants.
there you go.
here is the door.
ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
hello david.
great.
no... no, it is all right.
dwight, little help with the bags, please.
it is a trash can.
actually, I am sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, casino night.
and it is all inclusive.
why do not you just cool it, okay?
hey... guys, check it out.
bury them in my yard.
this way to the party bus.

we are talking about office stuff.
all right.
um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
do not say cocks.
you should not rush into this.
i just want you to treat me like you would some family member who is undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.
and i turn it on and i say 'prepare yourself for the utica chainsaw massacre.' you remember holly?
okay, okay.
he slept one night in your car too?
all the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
what do you want?
screw you, halpert.
i just, i need to know a little bit more about my friend.

okay, nobody touch pam's nipples.
oh no.
it was an accident.
and you tried to get off the party planning committee.
no, captain.
everybody's getting their chance.

ok...  well, i need to put this bike in there.
the truck.
maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.

give me the bottle, dwight!
let me give you the tour.
what about... ...january
i can not take it anymore.
it is been sitting in my car all day.
and you can not work for it.
um, actually you are not a client... so... we will just split it?
you know what?
i started by looking for a brownstone, like the huxtables had,  but instead i found this very, very, nice place in jamaica, queens, mon.
just... just fill up the cup.
it is christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy.
yeah, yeah... you know what?

i do not know what they are made of.
yet.
that is a little kinky.
hey, girls.
let us gooooo!
taking care of business.
okay, put it on my card.
and if it could not go to ryan, you are the guy I would want it to go to.

but you had to have the afternoon delight.
and also, i want you to spread the word that i will have my digital camera.
you were lying.
let us go!
i do not want you to ever lie to me.
I am having a huge blowout tonight, room 308. hope you can come.
yes, this is business.
yes, good.
so how you holding up?
oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down.
great work.
you have to tell him.
okay.
no, the country.
no, that is a german woman named urkel grue.
even if it did not, at least we put this matter to bed.
listen, listen, stanley.
no.
yuck!
I am getting a call.
he would know what to do.
beauty.
what!?
i will divide and then count to it.
let us do this.
this was a fake firing.
what we have to do here is go to run, and then you look up to powerpoint.
what is going on?
with really good bacon.
oh, yeah, put her through.
hey, oscar.
pam, can you come in here for a sec.
dwight, jim is sitting next to me.
dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
so let us make this the best dundies ever.
yeah!
why do not we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually.
rock n' roll!
inappropriate.
that is... very kind.
now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.
sorry man.
the refreshments?
hey, oscar!
and jan was really happy for me.
yes it is!
a knife, roll of duct tape, in case i need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel.
oh, my god!
joy.
this is a dummy, a la ferris bueller's day off.
and I am thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.
you know?
right... what is wrong.
hello, january well, i was letting everybody go to the big diwali party.
i was going to, i wanted to.
practically lives there.
i got a big bonus because i fired devon, and i used the money to buy something awesome.
and my hat's off to them.
feel no pain!
pam.
ah, too bad we do not have the good stuff here.
no, no, no, no, let us not talk about that.
yeah, i tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected... oh... oh, umm... yes.
mmm.
i am your boss and i may someday be your father, so get out.
thanks.
yeah.
no.
look at where you are going to be doing the cartwheel.
you guys think prison is so great?
sorry.
i like  them.
is that what you are wearing?
sorry, I am going into a meeting right now.
ok?
i was probably going to break up with her anyway.
one, two.. did not say three, did i?
no way, no how.
yeh.
that is what i thought.
and now he hates me.
how can you be sure?
because they are un-understandable.
um... and yes, it is a big speech.
me you?
someone else.
okay, so killing yourself.
oh, great, put her through.
take a seat.
who here has done something stupid in their lives?
look, dwight is a wuss.
but it was not a fair fight.
and i know it is illegal in pennsylvania, but it is for charity.
it is all downbeat, it is in the pocket, it is like...  dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah... du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do.
and... I am... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment.
no.
you.
ahh, still lame.
who wants some munchies?
not there.
yeah, i bet you would.
so ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond.
and i know what glee is, I am a total gleek.
i found it at spencer gifts.
eh.
okay, are you cool, really?
all right, how about some presents?
and i like it!
you really do not get it, do you?
i know all that.
I am leaving for the day at four.
I am sorry.
what?
actually this is good.
okay.
really?
is it <i>real</i> good?
yes.
alright!
so, what do you think?
um... okay, "meredith is so old..." if everybody... could do it?
what is happening?
shaaa-shut up.
thank you for coming.
because I am having fun?
i just want to hang out, just be one of the guys.
what you do is you put  them in a room, and you just-  hey.
come on.
thank you very much, everybody.
something about that seems inappropriate.
look at what you are wearing again, pam.
no.
okay everybody, big day.
well i will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
no!
what the hell is going on here?!
my bad.
some sort of pendleton crap.
unh!
he is scummy.
mittens.
i do not want to take credit for this, but roy and i were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices.
technically, we fell asleep in the same bed.
i said nothing specific because i was so busy.
get your own white out.
da  na na na na... this is going to be awesome.
can not do it then.
you will never find love.
is this about me and jan?
okay.
try "michael scott".
this entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order.
so... oh-whoa-oh!
we are not fired?
um, pam, i hate to break this to you but dwight can not stop you from being mugged.
by wanting it more.
do not drink all of it.
I am kidding around!
irrelevant.
okay.
there they are.
i will finish that later.
and my house is my house.
this copier... is...  working perfectly.
nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we are going to be doing separate checks.
let me know if i miscalculated the size.
that is who i am.
I have never met anyone who does that.
nice to meet you too.
twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm.
you mad at me?
when mary was denied a room at the inn... jesus was born.
you will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
we have a song to write.
go to a party really early.
argh, why are you all... shut up.
oh!
well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than i thought they would be.
all right.
stanley knows what I am talking about.
who should it come from, then?
you must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
they are correct, sir.
marv something?
I am eating tiramisu.
hey guys.
um, listen.
no no no, we are not going to see-- we are not going to see the four toed... creed, okay?
get in here.
and the reason you are here is that i need ideas for things that donna and i could do on the weekend.
wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around scranton.
i thought i could see dunder mifflin.
same answer.
when i was sixteen, i was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named julie.
it was not easy.
okay.
goodbye toby!
and then i thought maybe by the time i was 40, but by 40, i had less money than when i was 30.  maybe by my 50s, i do not know.
oh!
what are they?
jim halpert, welcome.
just... let us do it!
maybe, i do not know.
and she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, i guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of dunder mifflin, scranton.
i do not know how she dealt with that as long as she did.
no, no, toby.
you are very helpful are not you?
everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here do not get trophies, very often.
david told me on the phone.
it is the sandwitching hour!
but, I am sort of an expert at photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end.
kelly, i want you to do makeup.
you know?
i always thought darryl and pam might get me fired for something i said.
here we go, he is early with the cue.
hey ryan, can i get you a pencil from the warehouse?
its not just a van.
really?
pam, would you stand up for a sec?
okay.
I am just thinking about what you said, about karen, about closure.
jan, i defend your honor.
I am kind of sick of the attitude around here.
hurry up, let us do this!
no, i am, it is all about the personality, jim.
just had it.
you clearly do not care, so why do not you just leave?
he could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil.
"i feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business." yeah.
okay, alright.
crystal clear.
well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
who is getting married?
do it!
yeah, i know.
it is not that children make me uncomfortable, it is just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle?
hey.
oh... try not to be so hurtful jim.
want to bring it over... here, make some room.
that is true, that is true.
i know you are dying to say it, so just say it.
ugh.
yes.
but would i put him in charge?
alright, since i am the boss i will drive as well.
it is subtle.
carol?
that is what she... a lot of places are like that.
... wow, that is good timing.
they feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.
boom!
a place where unattractive and attractive people can get together.
yes, i am.
what?
well actually i can not cook, and i am starting a restaurant.
oh good.
that is a really pretty song.
well, you know something.
what?
hey, look at that.
i would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here.
a-holes.
I am going to, for old time's sake.
jim?
it is... way better than prison.
yeah.
let us call him and get the website.
well, i call it fun!
is that how we are going to get past this?
ahh, get away, cretin.
okay?
i feel proud.
well, i am in america and i am online, so i do think it involves you.
right?
that got a big laugh.
seriously, how did you do it?
really?
that is what she... kind of in the middle of something here.
come in.
peach iced tea.
very much, jim is my best friend.
little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she is in the desert and the field is an oasis.
no, i did not.
that says that you women are up against it.
hey, how you doing?
so, that is cool.
dogs, you know, you should know me better than that.
you know, this is not just an exercise.
not everyone took one.
right, so- why do not you explain what that is to- so that they can under- just explain what that is.
oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
hello.
please.
oh,  lazy.
stanley, may i talk to you for a second?
these people are my friends and i care about them!
hmmm?
all right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready.
that is a good question.
woo hoo.
...i do not hate it, i just do not like it at all.
deangelo, what are you doing?
you give me a good raise, or no more sex.
do not go.
pam, I am headed out to another meeting.
oh, no, no.
and, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy.
under your tongue.
reminds me of college.
what are the pros?
birdie.
dwight, please, please.
those people out there are clearly afraid.
too slow.
and the seats go all the way down.
no, uh,  seriously, i am on a lecture circuit.
i do not even, i do not even use a plate anymore.
a medium amount of good pizza?
why am i telling you my strategy?
what is taking that guy so long?
she is so young.
...or biologically.
may i have your attention please.
do not look all the way up.
just .. i mean, it is a party.
no costume?
angela, you are mrs. howell.
creed.
campus.
why... i mean, you just come in and you are just negative... ...and you just walk negatively.
and everybody thinks he is a tease.
what, are you talking about me and holly?
i find out everything about their prices and policies michael scarn.
i do not know.
i am on my way.
i guess we all kind of consider her a mom around the office.
how do you make depression sexy?
we were all chatting and i made a joke, a really dumb joke and craig the idiot took it seriously.
yes, say-ber.
here they are.
i do not want to hear about it.
you are right, you are right.
what?
gyaaah.
instead, it has become like when my mom moved in with jeff.
and i just want my nephew to work in my pool.
going to be fun!
banana fana fo fanley.
yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots.
i do not know how those got on there... must be hackers.
we can not start without michael!
you have got it.
um... "hey meredith, liz taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." because meredith's been divorced like, twice.
pam, i have ideas on a daily basis.
oh, really?
give me one good reason why i should fire you right here on the spot?!
ah, no.
oh man.
no respect at all.

hey everyone, can i have your attention please?
okay.
i do not know how.
just... all over.
it really does.
kenny g. is... if you knew jazz, you would know who i mean.
looks like santa was a little naughty.
when michael clump wants to remind you  that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.
listen, dwight.
this is just guys gently ribbing each other, it is what it is all about, just hangin' out.
okay.
that is enough!
you said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.
yeah.
yeah, that is right.
so, i-- okay.
everything's under control.
are you kidding?
oh.
so I am wise, and i have worms.

could you hold on?
andy, would you like to have my baby?
I am sorry.
