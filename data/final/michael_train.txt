going.
and... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I am crying, and nobody can hear me, because i am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
i love this.
curse is broken people!
and you can learn lessons about life even if you do not win.
adapt.
she is... we hooked up and... you know, months ago, just once, it is, just stupid.
because we work together.
do not try to follow me.
and i want you to say something different.
nice, huh?
i just did not inflate it all the way.
oh, you know what?
no, because we are the three amigos.
oh, no, that is a male model.
okay.
hello vancouver, this is michael scott calling from the united states of america!
here is the thing.
how many of you know the meaning of the jamaican term, hakuna matata?
little kid lover.
this is fun.
ok. you will do.
they are such babies.
because look at this normal sized coffee cup.
the old one two.
and he sat at my desk.
i just like you.
stop it.
whoo!
you said you did not have plans.
very, very much.
ohhh!!
oh, you are... you are dead.
I am greek!
oh, okay.
oh honey, i have the best trophy right here, aside from my dundies.
okay.
if that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
why privately?
i mean, i like ice cream.
and... uh, she is our receptionist.
why?
what is your problem?
help!!
sounds like fun.
here, shake.
nicely done.
today, i am in charge of picking a great new health care plan.
yes?
besides a monorail.
let us just run away to jamaica and live in a bungalow.
my little gal over there.
no.
oh.
look at him.
that girl's going to turn my hair gray.
no, no, no, no.
just like me.
yes, it was that.
drugs destroy careers.
would you like your confirmation number?
I am sorry, toby.
ok, let us go.
i really do not.
hello, mr. egghead!
what?!
no.
it was beautiful.
i could have helped.
I would like to see a menu please.
and are you, argh.
no.
you know, ryan, it is all about the benjamins.
you are right, you are right.
did he call?
cool.
ok, yup.
well, that is what scranton is all about.
jim.
i can not do thursday.
do you know?
but it would not be the worst thing in the world... if somebody... it is a big red trash compactor!
dwight!
well, yeah, but you do not need the brochure.
when did the cast list go up?
of course.
what?
ohhhh!
because I will do it.
i have four kids.
jim!
we can do... oh.
because you have really done some great work.
yeah!
pam?
i think she is being very unprofessional over there.
there will be food.
you can go mess with josh's people, but I am the head of this family, and you are not going to be messing with my chillin.
it was a lovers' quarrel.
mmm.
but i just... just want to keep it within reason.
oh, it is really cold here.
he is a good guy, not a terrorist.
no no no, no, new suit, please.
dwight, i was open.
no, no no no no.
this is going to be good and everybody's going to come.
and even though we are still a family here at dunder-mifflin, families grow.
keep.
it blows, man.
i think ryan has a gay crush on me.
all right.
thank you... dwight.
well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like jordan and pippin!
pretty pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one.
i learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
oh ok, all i know is i would like some chicken fingers and a midori sour.
ed's tires.
ok, I am going to ask you something and i want you to be honest.
i hardly know her.
it is just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
hey!
a dead body.
yes.
no, i fired them, and your next.
yes.
explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
so that just leaves dwight and jim.
i do not know, it could be any number of people.
you know, you are totally harshing the office mellow.
can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences?
now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
you and dwight were close.
you are on a roll.
may i borrow someone is textbook, please?
like i begged you to?
yeeesh.
okay, no no, I am going to pass, I am going to pass.
and, yes, I have heard women and children first.
yes, you know what?
haha, i do!
no, no, no, no, no.
that jim is also a friend of mine, and i would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.
get me!
he is in love with a girl he works with who is engaged.
no, no, no... no, no... i do not like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
did not work out in the end.
what are you... nothing.
that is rule number two.
no, this is completely the time, this is perfect time.
ok, here is the dream team.
wow, i am blown away by this.
this, my friends, is the master bedroom.
ugh... all right.
best salesman I have ever met.
and how about casual friday again, huh?
that is, you know what?
no.
wow, man.
uh huh, uh huh.
and I will go back to jan, and i hate jan!
thank you, ryan.
now, when dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, i think he is speaking out of turn.
i did a lot more than wave.
i have a nice wood desk.
that is what we said last time.
"old school".
okay.
thank god, for everybody right?
no.
better than that.
but we are falling behind, did you know that?
a cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or... no, no, obviously older.
"hello.
we are doing this thing!
that plus jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
we are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives.
and i was sitting at this desk when i called you to tell you that i had herpes and that i was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you did not love me.
yes, it is.
yes, i will.
yeah?
i am not going to do the twirl.
I am embarrassed it was even that close though.
no, no.
you are making it sound kind of lame.
watch out for snakes!
to greet.
jefferson.
hey, guys.
also, try to discuss it over indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
it is all connected.
you do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
and i have to get into my head and focus.
we are going to come back with a plan for you.
oh!
well, hello to you, too.
and because of that...i want you to work for me.
wh--  you sabotaged me.
ed?
hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
thirty.
actually, it has been withdrawn.
yes!
i guess you said something weird about your daughter?
oh, do we?
just get me out of here.
oh, wow.
kevin, stay.
dwight... no.
aaah... thanks, dwight, for a crappy plan.
darryl.
oh, right, I am sorry.
jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk.
we will be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
just stop it.
you will see.
uh, uh huh.
ok. ok, yeah.
i got a big box how 'bout you?
because i value your opinions.
it is that one.
they do not know that!
i will do better.
look how cute.
i think she just wants to hear my voice.
okay, we can start.
so i guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have?
are we not, are we not, are we not?
"did your mom ever see you naked?" so you can molest me?
do not run.
or sooner.
you... you would both lose.
who saw that coming?
wow.
i talked to her-holly.
somebody put a piece of gum in there.
just keep pushing... I am right here.
there is coffee in the kitchen, pam.
you are smart, capable.
i do not, i do not know.
if you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room.
yes.
that is neat.
no.
you are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me.
this is my conference room.
good.
he hated fun.
ah, the volunteer sheriff station.
okay first, i would like a whereabouts on pam.
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
umm... i have done some very bad things, things of which i am not proud.
"you guys suck!
ok, good.
everything!
great.
sure.
pam, please clear my phone lines.
no.
oh.
okay, I am aquaman.
rich people love pizza.
deal or no deal?
saunas.
give me the bottle or you are fired.
how do we combat this guy?
charles got fired.
you should not have taken it.
hey, hey jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.
ladies and gentlemen, i have an announcement to make.
but i think we should hang out more together.
how many is that per hour?
i do not want you to fall.
yeah, blah, blah, blah.
what is going on?
bad advice from my number two.
david's gone.
you have complained about everybody in the office, except dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with dwight.
i think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah?
please stop popping my cast.
i am getting out there.
yes, we did.
i would have never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
yes you will.
it is not like I am begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants.
i love it.
he was here?
so stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
and if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.
because your bros are always there for you.
and somehow I am supposed to put on a costume and smile.
with a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there.
okay.
because of the downsizing.
well, if you could do me a big favor and tell mr. schofield that michael scott has tickets to the wilkes-barre penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... hello, daniel.
why do not you take a picture.
chuck e. cheese?
but sometimes the ends justify the mean.
just dig.
this is the party.
me, me, me, me, me, me.
ask the climate.
the answer dishes to the question.
science fiction convention, nope.
hi.
um... i kind of wish I would been hit by a car.
ooh, someone is freakin'.
everyone, i am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation.
yes.
i think so.
shh... I am really sorry.
hey, call my cell phone.
the dundie award for "longest engagement" goes to pam beesley.
sounds like your classice big-picture decision.
and that is   hard.
ah.
i need to let somebody go today.
that is lemon.
i could manage my way around that.
oh... wow.
i say seventeen squares.
it is not my decision.
shake it up!
yeah.
it is disgusting.
so far, these are my leads.
everybody, we are at defcon 5. i am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the wbre news site.
there would be no government, and things could get terrible.
it is a way to  okay, there is a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
hey, everybody look, pam.
and then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling.
agreed.
no, no!
uh, aaaahhh!
you are safe here.
of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
i am going to steal all of your clients, and then i am going to kill them in front of you.
good to see you.
yes!
ah, damn!
dwight, I am the boss.
great.
i did not give you $40.
i honestly do not see what the big deal is.
imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand- oh, okay.
you know, dwight, sometimes... i do not know, i think you say things just to agree with me.
oh well.
let us go.
if you gain weight, you will die.
good.
i want you to take a card.
what the hell are they talking about?
this is what a true survivor man does.
awards you like to hate it.
except for pam.
it is like christmas, easter, and halloween-- --rolled into one.
tails.
no, no, no, just... that is not his real name.
does not matter.
everybody, i will see you tomorrow, saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that i am wearing right now, if you catch my drift.
you sorta disappeared there for a while.
this is my last dundies ever, if i want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
now I am going to have to go online and look at turtles or I will be off all day.
like... i do not... i do not know.
arrr, dooby dooby do.
and gromit.
ahhh.
everything else is up to your imagination.
and you are going to put on your dancing shoes later on!
i have to say, i am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
why do you think so many businesses move to the caymans?
oh, that is my favorite ocean!
i get up to the building, i get to the revolving door... broken!
i am going to come at you, and i am going to come at you hard.
okay, well... jim?
we have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.
so david wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except nashua, still a little bit raw there.
it could have died of natural causes.
okay.
nike.
there is some seed money for you.
did you know that lincoln's secretary was named kennedy.
hey, what a game, huh?
we do not - it does not have to be paper.
packer is a survivor of divorce stanley.
todd packer, ladies and gentlemen!
that is why i always start with a gun, because you can not top it, you just can not.
i want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a mtv on crack kind of thing.
okay.
i am a huge woody allen fan.
yes.
you should go to the glider diner.
now hit me.
hey, watch it, watch it.
well, I am not gay jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
dwight, do you mind if we talk?
yeah.
hello, holly.
you have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
oh, what?
come on in.
i always have.
that is great.
we have a meeting in the conference room, as soon as possible.
excuse me, everyone.
she said that?
we shall see.
a bargain at any price!
dwight does not play a robot.
grapes.
because the michael scott paper company is about to open a big old can of whoopass on dunder mifflin.
i do not know, i offered him his temp job back.
that- that was a bluff, um...  listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I am going to poach one of yours.
an hour long shower with guys.
just stop it.
all right.
we can now sell hammermill products.
all right.
no!
excellent.
thank you very much, sir.
okay.
holly, this is not ocean's eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and do not care about how it turns out.
you are making some very dangerous assumptions oscar.
and i nevah got caught, neither.
maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
hey, there is like, 300 more of these.
the human being man's name was devon.
well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can not even find their way to work?
just whatever comes to mind.
dwight, what will happen to that family if i call david and give him this information?
that is ridiculous.
well, it is nice for you.
h&amp;r block?
where is my little nibblet?
and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss.
hey!
any message you want me to relate to jim?
yes it is, well, w-w-you need someone in the middle to facilitate... I am not just a middle... man... you are describing office depot, and they are kind of running us out of business.
yuh, yuh, yes!
oh, great.
i can do that, it is my office.
but there is a lower half.
I will give you a hint.
these meetings are useless.
i love it.
and a lot of people do not give shakespeare enough credit.
and if you tell me, that i have to drive back to scranton, to the satellite party, i am going to throw up!
pac-man.
uhh, yes, i did, here is the dizzle.
uh-huh.
why thank you very much.
right?
I am thinking we will have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison.
I am not busy at all, I am not doing anything.
what?
i see the sales department as the furnace.
yeah.
how is the party coming along?
ugh.
okay.
that is still going on?
boom!
come on up here you sick bastard.
and i always have.
let us do it to it!
just be more scared of me, okay?
oh.
no it is not.
nah, he is an ass.
assistant to  the regional manager.
went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive.
yeah, i do not think that would happen.
boom!
yes.
thanks.
that is great.
well the invitation says vip's only.
no, you do not even know what stupid is.
good.
they are smaller than we are.
wuh-- that is crazy.
yes, you did.
i want to get personal and i want you all to really open up.
bye.
there is this resort called sandals.
michael scott paper company only.
do you want some coffee er- or some tea or hummus or something?
no.
it is important that this company celebrates its diversity.
hahahaha.
ok, yeah.
oh... wow.
we would be married.
I will just wave and introduce myself.
forward it like it is hot.
thank you dwight.
why do not they just make the plane out of the airline food?
no.
oh!
i think it does.
what do you do?
ohhh, what?
funny thing about it, we do not even need him.
i can hook you up.
i did?
yes it is.
i did it with january yeah!
why are not they building it themselves?
maybe they are shrinking.
that could be a little confusing, because in sales a-b-c means "always be closing." shut it.
how are you?
i show you to your desk.
you are close with pam too.
ok. hmm.
<i>I am</i> the head of the company?!
i want you to role play firing me.
an intervention.
ohh... ok, everybody out.
ladies, let your hair down.
this is mandatory.
congratulations!
i know, i know.
i do not think we have finished with my inbox.
not a contender.
this- my plan- a man- panama.
if you are going to do your job well here, you got to get used to being embarrassed.
must really have you thinkin'.
wow.
there.
maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.
ryan, you want to stretch?
so double offensive.
okay.
just eat it, eat it, phyllis.
right down the hall is a bed room.
big plans.
i miss the old dunder mifflin.
accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
just act normal.
it is every parent's dream.
come on up!
shrek, I am a donkey!
this is just a fight.
would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?
yep, we will get to you.
do not.
you are lucky you have me here.
i am not michael.
when we leave here and go up to niagara falls we are representing dunder mifflin, everyone.
and here we have stanley the manly.
hey hey!
leave him alone.
it is not ready yet.
holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker.
i have an appetite for life!
I am cool.
good.
uh oh.
let us gangbang this thing and go home.
i was in your heart... and next to your kids.
and that is something toby will never understand.
why not just sweet?
that was really good.
it was topical.
yeah, why not?
talk to you later-  okay, you did not let me say good-bye.
a thousand big ones.
i need a smart intern.
ok. that is to broad.
people, listen up and listen good.
we should have a party and not invite them.
he is not the worst.
but, one question at a time please.
ok, great.
shh!
well power through the arthritis phyllis you can do it!
right there.
i do not know how i feel.
me too.
yes, it is mine.
come in!
it is got to be something else.
drugs.
amazing.
that would not seem genuine.
i want my baby back, baby back, baby back chili's baby back ribs... woo, well, this brings us to january  truth or dare?
mmm!
we crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of cindy crawford nude... that, but the women I am getting fixed up with are, egh!
no.
ah!
hello.
it is like another seven hours.
but this is not a kid's environment.
ha ha, you got that right!
and... when we have a good quarter, fireworks?
no, we do not actually cut the paper.
zone, phyllis!
... what, nerf is not cool anymore?
cafe disco is dead but i can still hear the music in my head.
but what?
happy birthday, buddy.
ok, I am fine, no i know, I am good, I am good, it is just.
i do not know.
i wrote letters.
that is what she said.
look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
no.
oscar, here you go.
these are people you can trust.
well, pam is cute.
roasted.
because i loves to party and I am going to be partying my butt out at this place.
hey.
yes.
dwight, get the door.
yehhh, okay, shuuttt it michael.
he is outta here!
so well-loved.
that i was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich.
today is not a good day for a sales contest.
i will use your talents come baseball season, my friend.
but had to end, because the summer was over.
this is ryan, the new temp.
no.
she suckered you too.
he is not going to college.
that is the american dream right there, right?
look at him.
come on- here we go.
I am kidding.
and unless you have a better argument than that, i suggest you leave.
is not he big?
no.
yeah.
why do not you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
all right!
well, that is not going to happen!
yes, i promise.
so, what about you, angela?
poor little guy.
because of the downsizing.
let us hear it.
and talking to them today, i do not feel for them anything like what i feel for you.
what is the matter?
so you do not want to end our relationship?
i... we are going to have to... you... you want something better.
time to bring out the big guns.
from me.
and I have dated four women in the last- not last - no.
you get me.
you are so brave.
you are a liar.
have a good night.
really?
la telefona.
I am sorry.
what is that?
oh, come on!
anything your heart desires.
she brought it into the work place so i feel like it has to be dealt with here.
all right.
hey dwight, he found it.
what?
you would better try it on, make sure it fits.
when two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
oh, hi friend!
but a pledge?
so here is to conversation.
huh, what?
drinks are on me!
pfffffttt.
the main part with the buildings.
you may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
this is a business scenario.
I am very fast.
i can handle it.
consecutive.
fake tree.
no.
'kay.
bah!
nothing?
traitor!
i try not to think of it as lagging behind.
can we down the reverb?
am i going on go?
oh, it is okay, I am going down.
really?
you never know about the press.
ohhh nooo.
follow my lead.
what?
ok, everybody.
and then i say, "hey!
jan and i broke up.
who is to say?
no, no.
still do not know who i am?
these are your best friends.
no, no, no, no.
i did.
and if toby is a part of it... then it will suck.
right?
well, you know what?
or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you have been... ever.
we will give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
today is about family.
you know what they say?
what, uh... .
yeah.
i dunno, i think those it guys messed up.
what am i saying?
boner patrol.
your loss, stanley.
well, you do not have all the information.
no matter... where.
because I have got monies to move around.
where did you leave it?
da  na na na na!!
yeah.
it was right under his nose.
all right.
for instance, why do not you go to business... stop.
ok everybody, listen up.
all right.
there has to be a problem with him.
god, when he needed help on earth, who did he hire?
hey, good morning.
thank you.
stevie wonder is married.
there is nothing classier than boring jazz music.
aaand is about 90% sure.
and then when you said you defintely did not want to have kids, who had it reversed back?
well, you are wearing it at the office.
but seriously, what is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
no, no.
fine.
much better.
okay.
jim's a good kid.
hey!
what a nice guy.
why do not we watch that show that you have been wanting to watch, that stupid battleship galaxy.
um...    i can not stand it , i can not stay in here another second.
do you know who that is?
did you believe me?
hey guys, what is going on?
say it is not so, jo, we are going to miss you, we are going to miss you so much!
wow!
mmhmm!
we are not hiring, jim.
pamela morgan beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
yes, that is a good point.
I am not, I am not getting married.
i know you are.
so maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'stop because i want you to stop' or stop as in 'stop.
christmas has come early this year.
go ahead.
well, then i guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, does not it?
i just know that i am flying high and i do not even want to think about it.
think i did a good job?
dwight, dwight, great idea.
oh, yeah!
and the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother.
it is bitter because i slightly destroyed a wonderful little family.
come on.
i looked at wallace and i said "i quit!" and as i turned to leave i looked back and i said "you have no idea how high i can fly." why would i do that?
bye.
oh good, good stanley!
so, umm... thanks for coming by.
snip snap!
i do not want to be shila, i like being michael scott.
you are?
really?
it has a little bit of a weird smell.
we are not.
no.
that was terrible advice.
that is probably throwing you off a little bit.
i need to have her say... i need to say, "what the hell is that?
and prison.
just - sh - shut - shut up.
my lord my liege.
everybody, stop.
I am so sorry.
do you think that kevin is going over my head?
stop!
sales team, listen to me.
handed to me as i sat down.
well, hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order.
mm-hmm?
let us get back together.
i like starting each day with a sense of possibility.
stop it!
which one is that again?
you are a warrior.
we even like the same girls, some of us.
okay.
but it works.
say clump!
do you mind if i run out and get it?
shhh.
n- well, to be fair, jim... james... jimothy... to be fair, jimothy, the- ah, that sounds weird.
hey david, how are you?
they stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses.
carol.
women can not have fun if they do not feel safe.
what difference does it make whether your here?
you should have seen your face.
we are doing this because of you.
life moves a little slower in scranton, pennsylvania.
i... i have essentially... i have essentially.
you know what you should do to be hilarious?
i have a cold sore.
ok, sweetie.
yes he is.
it is time to be boss.
you are all right though, right?
take care of anything you forgot to do.
you ready to give me my discount now?
who else thought that i was leaving?
i mean- do you ever wrestle with each other?
the bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.
i hate it.
i make originals.
welcome.
we already have a sofa.
no, it is just us.
dude, I am going to nail it.
eww.
now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department?
it is already up.
i am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up.
because if I am not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.
and now he wants to know what i think.
okay, i have to fire somebody.
the foam ... oh, right.
oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
ryan and i are just having some fun!
ok, a little too far, crossed the line.
stanley, you know that is not true.
you know what, sometimes it is not about whether cinderella gets her slipper back, but it is about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.
they just relax, they party all the time.
what?
okay, i told you these guys had a sense of humor.
guys, just... thank you for talking.
i must cover it with my jacket.
hey david-  I am sorry.
woody your favorite character?
god!
I will take it from here.
oh, i bet.
let us do this.
three, two, one.
there is no toilet paper here.
no, you get outta here.
very good.
come on!
well, that was a waste of a text.
wow, you are huge!
and dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly i have misjudged you from the beginning, and i apologize.
wow, yuck.
it is too early to tell.
i just made kevin cry.
she would think of me as her friend.
you know what?
bye hello, carol?
no.
who else?
i burned my foot!!!
and i am baaaack!
that is it.
so i think i will just...drag it out.
"oh buy me something expensive or I am going to kill myself."  that is not - i do not care about that.
I am going in for a procedure today.
yes... get back, get back.
nice surprise.
that is great, because, you know, the paper industry's not going to last forever.
ok. i do not care how your day was either, january i was just asking you because you asked me.
i worked.
i am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.
are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
who would you do?
yes.
you should not have been, because you were dealing with michael scarn.
whereas back here in scranton i am still top dog, in a fairly large pond.
i am looking forward to lunch.
this, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
two dollars, three dollars?
i spent all day, trying to make her like me, and i forgot to ask myself something: do i even like her?
no, i do not think they are.
maybe next year.
it would!
okay.
come here.
yoga!
you know what, that is the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate.
come on, stand up on your chair.
kiss ass.
that was deer!?
not going to make this one.
how about this weekend?
we will get somebody to clean that up.
it is not a matter of more or less.
and the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.
the first style is lose/lose.
yeah.
marriage.
you want to talk now, good; ok, dwight, leave.
do not swallow it.
okay, okay.
I will tell you this, it is <i>not</i> because of the boob job.
am i shiny?
not!
he told me where his kids go to school.
you are.
i know, I am sorry about that.
no, you may not.
you did not need to do that.
ideas please, right now!
it is an outrage, that is all.
mmmm, no, no, it is... sedentary... no.
need anything?
the rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
not it.
alright, let me explain.
you have no idea what you are talking about.
they are nutritious.
that is why you made the decision.
i know.
I am moving out to the burbs... actually, I am moving further than the burbs, I am moving to colorado.
sorry andy.
there they are.
i want to smash it!
I am so, so sorry.
united in applause.
ohhhh.
what?
coincidence - i am going to go for a little stroll myself.
you know what?
those duke boys are at it again.
i think we are a classic couple.
scranton.
uhhh... nothing.
i just have a different life style.
a little over the top, do not you think?
they are men, dwight.
all right.
let us see josh find another stanley.
and frankly i think you were being a total and utter jerk.
see you later.
what?
if you are here for the grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.
namaste.
oh, that guy?
who had a big, puttifflin.
yes, is mr. hudson there?
i wished for pam to gain courage.
thanks.
no reason.
fillipellers, how is it hanging?
there is just one of me, and there is a thousand of them.
i want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... take a card, take a card, any card.
yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on pam.
you are auctioning a hug?
and packer told them that we were brothers.
body image.
thank you.
it is true.
well then i will not get a warrantee.
at dunder-mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and i do not know who instituted it.
our pentagon.
when i am backed into a corner, that is when i come alive.
shrunken chesticles.
haha.
what is the point of that?
yeah.
regional manager.
yes, yes, right away.
just compare last year's order to this year's.
what purpose did that serve?
looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
i was under the impression that billy would be more like that guy.
year after year, i catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year i present this award to a guy instead of a girl.
chang's.
I am digging.
your client, dunmore high-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.
it is ok. watch it.
okay.
and things were getting hot and heavy.
the important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win.
they are in for a bitter surprise.
what is it?
i mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on.
that is good!
hey, stanley!
that is my christmas card.
you are not going to paris.
you too, have a good night.
well, you did not, because i know where ya hid the diamonds.
and apparently, some people throw up.
we are not supposed to pda.
well, we will see.
yes, i know it is not on the coupon.
oh my god!
the michael scott paper company.
in a good way.
come on.
is this why you called me down here?
this is stanley hudson, one of our talented salesman.
just like the oscars!
acrimonious.
you need to be robin williams and m. night shyamalan.
okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please.
alright, michael scott paper company.
that is good.
as far as i can tell, I am the best-looking person here.
I am thrilled with the work they have done today, both quality and the quantity.
we will do this.
illuminating.
good.
i think the meetings are very important.
can you hold down the fort?
okay.
"dunder mifflin, this is pam.
I am going to be.
actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
you know what?
close the door if you would.
I am hearing you, meeting confirmed.
piece of cake.
she used to work for h.r.?
thank you very much.
we need jobs.
let us go out!
pam, it is michael.
i was talking about... what do- what?
ass.
come back and then go.
but you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and i just can not wait to see how you handle it.
it is not olden times anymore.
i do not think you do.
lynn, follow me, come on in.
dwight?
the word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation.
everyone here knows that i can not and will not keep a secret.
erin, would you help her, for god's sake?
that is not important, jim, i just think we should not listen to any of that crap.
I am not strong!
ok, ready?
two minutes apart.
what if no one named hanson showed up?
do not.
i need to have her tell me herself.
this is just a first fight of many fights we are going to have.
ah.
oh nonsense , no way, no.
oh really?
just the urine.
any messages for 308?
oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.
the cobwebs and such?
I am looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer.
oscar, you brought your speedo, i assume?
oh, my god.
you might take something.
and that is why god made so many.
change your mind, come back up.
just wrap your heads around the reality of that.
well here we all are.
go, oscar.
i think kevin wants one.
you work at an adult arcade.
hey there, jada.
he is fat.
yes.
i got his pants.
oh, wow.
there is this woman i met a few weeks ago.
we... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
stat.
little sugar rush.
hey, angela, rushy, rushy.
you are going to go back to nashua eventually, and i can not handle it.
can you smell the power of the halperts?
this is real life.
got to represent.
she is probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar!
jim is stepping down to salesman, i am going to be the sole manager once again.
i know a fair amount about fine food... and drink.
you can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me.
come on.
you know what?
or ryan stiles, something like that.
yes, jan, really.
you walk out that door and it is over.
well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot.
I am going to grab a glass of water.
geography joke.
ok. see you soon.
is that what we are going for now?
that is why you are not on the team.
yes, about that.
no.
ok, everybody have their towels and swim suits?
i got it on a website, that is not important.
take it from toby.
and i just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it is really beyond words.
people turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my nana's investment club can help the michael scott paper company become a reality, then I am sure that is what she would have wanted.
no.
exactly.
come on.
just a minute.
who suggested cake?
am i doing the wrong thing?
you like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like... sales is and could be very, very cool.
do not worry, i have got the tip.
he is a sports guy.
it is space garbage.
incidentally, where were you during all of this?
guh.
what am i supposed to do?
huge?
you do not know what it is.
what is this in reference to?
alright.
so...  that is uh... thank god.
all right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
what a weird thing to say.
you know we are just going to call a tow truck, so... no, no, really not necessary.
hello.
he does not need help, pam.
tell me a white person you trust.
but you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way.
i hit a deer with my car.
about the new company?
nah.
it is michael.
because it is better.
are you?
and probably god would be the fourth one.
hey let me escort you to your desk.
what sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that?
and i can not help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "how could they do this to us?" it is not... nevermind.
here is the ring.
okay.
well, kevin, i guess it is just me and you.
it was awesome.
i just have a few things i want to say.
we should give him a one-way ticket to montego bay, where they keep all the al-qaeda.
great equalizer.
we have to have the same weight distribution.
like umm... ten minutes?
hey, would you like to go to sandals, jamaica with me?
no.
ah.
if it is a medium i send it back.
it is amazing.
jim, let us go.
come on!
the whole thing's silly, is not it?
no way.
getting back on the market.
our first arrival.
I am getting a stitch.
okay, good.
a limousine is something that a company sends when they have because for celebration.
yeah!
but we were at the dmv waiting in line.
um, yeah.
I will talk to her.
you just took one more person's breath away.
and if not acceptance, then just depression.
she will be sitting home saying, "jim... take the baby to the zoo because i want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."   "and... and clip my toenails." now you sound like kermit.
ok. alright.
she is such a weirdo!
do not... is that dwight?
so.
i do not want to end up like sunny bobo.
think of pam's nipples as toby's grundle.
no, whomever is never actually right.
oh.
going to be very delicious.
jan levinson-gould.
umm... what?
how you doing stud?
i will see her every now and then, and... maybe one year she will be with somebody, and the next year, I will be with somebody, and it is going to take a long time... and then it is perfect.
smooth roll.
do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
stop it.
let me just start.
you are an idiot.
like we are going to the science museum.
you know what?
honestly, every time i try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way.
so, why did you and karen break up?
i am teaching them a lesson, so.
you are right.
she is dead?
dwight brought glasses and a person.
why did you go in there?
lowest in town.
no, no, no.
okay.
hello!
people who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves!
wow!
here is what I would like to do.
no.
um, i got some photos from costa rica if you want to see them?
uh-huh.
um... ok, "meredith is so old..." everybody?
you do not get it.
no?
hey.
okay.
how about this?
but you know, life is about more... than just salaries.
i will not resign.
i say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and do not say anything about it.
but it is not christmas, it is diwali.
names, numbers.
so without further ado, jim and dwight show us what you got.
really makes me want to go to italy some day.
I am going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.
it was so embarrassing.
I will talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
and, ditto.
the pressures of my office are insane.
here is to mr. iacocca and his failed experiment, the de lorean.
i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
i know the challenges this county's up against.
jesus!
all right.
narc!
is this it?
that is good.
why are you here?
i did not sign up for this.
you can not smoke anywhere these days.
it is like  dave died or something.
when you work for sabre, only one thing matters.
nope!
you moved it.
so... hey hey hey!
breasts: not anything to write home about.
it is actually a very cute story.
well, actu-too soon.
please let go.
but I am not.
creed... huh.
brainstorming session is now open.
whassup!
you know what?
take a sick day.
ah, all right.
barack obama.
all right, everybody in the conference room!
i know him.
do you mean it?
you know what, christmas is not about santa, or jesus.
although he is probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
now i know there is some rumors out there and i just kind of want to set the record straight.
you do not know anything!
no!
oh, yuck, that is worse than you playing.
pam, can you take this down?
no, did you?
you want me to be happy?
no.
hey!
okay.
why do you think that?
wow!
there is no- meet- ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
nice.
no way.
what?
what if this does not work?
anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
pukey.
you stole my joke.
okay?
can i ask you a question?
and that is all i needed; I am good.
there is another woman.
not playing favorites.
you know what toby?
i told you the titles are irrelevant.
on the other hand, i may have to deal with the dark unknown.
unless you and i decide we want to talk to jo, then we will give her a call.
how about a clear signal, right?
all right, fatty.
and i just do not think corporate is going to go for this right now.
did you see the game last night?
not me, him.
no!
settle town.
no.
if she starts having sex with me I will know for sure.
oh, how much does it hurt?
there are fire-eaters all over the place.
well that is a... pretty good reaction.
what is happening?
while we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, i wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
and if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop.
oh, pam!
that could not possibly be it.
we are thinking about it.
eeeh!
i... if i was going to put someone in charge, i would put burt in charge or i would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like maria or gordon, maybe.
thanks.
our balls are in your court.
now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important." great marks, phyllis.
where you going?
roasted.
his father ran the freaking country, okay?
michael, i know what you are thinking.
this is why i do it, that is what i have to come home to.
i just said it.
god, stanley, that is frickin' brilliant.
but, clearly, they make it work.
and they are wrong.
i just got back from my procedure, so- how are you doing?
why do not you just eat it, ok?
okay.
get away from him.
kid did all the work.
he just totally lost it.
stop it right-stop it right now.
you guys could double date.
that rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way.
what is the problem?
goodbye.
calling from... pick up.
that is what she said.
oh, the wall.
oh, most honorable pamera.
that was fun.
oh, well thank you very much for all of your help.
not really my cup of tea.
is this the cup?
yes.
why am i talking to you?
yes she does.
okay, am i grabbing this one?
okay.
i thought there should be an hr rep here for this.
stop!
nothing's stopping you.
except there is no grass out there.
so, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?
i will have a chicken breast hold the chicken.
okay.
shut up.
oh, god, darryl!
an a.l.f.
is it a priority?
i do not think you are doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
is there...?
nerd.
happy halloween, everyone!
i should not say that jokingly because she will sue me.
please, do not want to spoil it for anybody.
the only cure i know for the monday blues is... varsity blues!
no, i got to go.
that was fun.
hawkman.
oh, i see, you are chickening out on me.
mmm mmm!
hold it!
i want you in the school.
so, how you been?
oh you can not because i do not care.
somebody really put a lot of work into that.
his last name is christ.
go!
that is where we need you.
well, sometimes.
oh, shoot.
speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms.
i know the market, i know the price points.
go!
the odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.
ok. come on.
send me a picture.
alright, then we are screwed.
erin is just weird.
oh yeah!
there.
this is you.
cool.
hmmm.
erin would like a few words with you.
come on over.
next year?
we are situated on the northeast corner of scenic lake scranton.
okay, okay!
some of what we order depends on whether we are having sex after.
are we cool?
we did have a baby carriage, which i got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a dui.
um, good.
hello, dwight.
"california is bankrupt, and california, california."  what?
yes.
you are a a good guy.
i do not want to do anything... I am dying... right there.
that is - you saw who did this and you did not stop them?
ahem.
what do you know about conflict resolution?
congressman could follow.
okay.
yeah, well... that is not going to fly here.
they are doing fine.
well, it is mostly made up.
so, rules be damned, i want to have lunch with these people.
michael scott returning.
you know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them?
meredith, please, get bottled water.
scranton.
gay pride parade?
please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
i checked the, uh... i check the jewels every month.
see you.
not now, not ever.
well, i am just getting settled in.
you ever done this?
you guys are pathetic.
plus i just... i think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
and you must be punished.
i really think you screwed the pooch on one, creed.
what do you want from this job, provided the company does not go out of business?
I am not saying... a damn thing.
let me tell you something.
thank you.
it was a bad trip.
blah-di-blah!
all right.
oh, yes stanley.
no!
but then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what?
no.
robin williams.
look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.
come on.
this is how i want it to feel.
what i failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad.
always have your back.
that is amazing.
just.. we are not going to pay for a bathing suit.
assistant to the regional manager.
cake it to the limit.
i am a karaoke fiend.
why, you are some sorta wise guy, huh?
on the phone.
okay, well, a pleasure.
suck it up.
that is not going to happen.
no.
can not step away.
can you send dwight in here?
work with a bunch of idiots.
uh, i may need some immediate assistance.
that is not true.
phyllis is like our mrs. butterworth.
a what?
if a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.
and i have no savings whatsoever.
you use your brain too much.
hank, please escort charles from the building.
great boy.
haha, come on!
oh god.
it was one joint in the parking lot.
come on.
why is he even here?
anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and i never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one.
do you want this open or closed?
I am captain jack sparrow.
christmas is canceled.
i do not know.
well, i guess i forgot to give you a donut .
sure.
yeah.
okay, alright.
um... alright, well then, i will proceed.
with a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, i think i can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
what?
ok, you know what, i do not want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it is not fair to people with rabies.
and the little shark eats a littler shark.
I am a shoo-in.
thank you.
he has the best sales record in the office.
yes.
and walk away.
there is a guy, there is a guy.
that is not the way i heard it.
come on in.
and at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have.
stir the melting pot, pam!
you sure?
well, he <i>is</i>.
you are!
pam?
um... yeah.
and if i die i want my son to know the dealio.
well i have interviews.
all the time i was thinking, "I am sleeping with your wife." and you know who does that?
come on, let us get this party started, ha!
i know, i know, i know.
sandwiches.
ladies and gentlemen, i present to you the dream team.
apollo creed.
ohh, lunch party.
okay.
I am going to stall them for a little bit.
check it again.
my god, dwight.
pam, it is very complicated.
you know what that is?
...simpsons.
does not matter, because i am going to take a nap.
there was no other guest the entire time i was here.
well then, you are now acting manager of dunder mifflin scranton branch, and i... am assistant regional manager.
she bought it?
i do not have the relationship with these people that i thought i did.
just-in case.
attention, everybody.
so is this for a movie that you are writing?
but the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is january but the brain needs a heart, and that is me again.
who else has an idea?
i do not know, what can i say?
we will not rest until this problem is solved.
whoa!
i love ladies, always have.
i worked so hard for this!
had some problems, blah blah blah.
how could she do this to me, pam?
this is a keystone account.
ok, goodbye prince family.
um... you know, the ball's in their court.
it was... it was never my intention to ruin a life.
no.
what if meredith was taking her smoking break below that window?
pam, messages please?
and I am here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people!
yes.
dwight, i would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
yes kevin.
i can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour.
do not!
yeah?
pam left her ipod at her house.
yeah!
it is not!
well, I am sorry to inconvenience you, meredith.
how is this going to be any different?
she washes dogs.
this... um, here is the deal.
okay.
i got a big box, yes i do.
back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they would throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
yes.
no.
kevin has an enormous heart.
right, i know paper, i know how to manage.
ooh.
and it will not kill erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like i promised him...  i bet his heart is enlarged, though.
one more.
no, i was looking online about sebaceous cysts.
you are a good man.
that is my white out.
let us do a little something.
what?
dwight, do not!
yeah, baby, i am feelin' better.
you looked freaked, man.
pamela.
well, when she comes back we will do it again.
get set.
i would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
what?
is if we built a loft.
have a good weekend.
they stopped making plaques that year.
where did you eat?
... aww, that... sucks, great.
you are the one.
matchmaker!
thank you.
in your experience, what should i be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?
i mean, you remember my idea for the fourth pirates movie.
i believe in us.
uh, it is equal.
he is going down our street!
that is sorta secondary.
could we get a delorean?
too many words.
wow!
well, i just like to look good ok, so -- no, i am just coming out myself.
hey, hey, hey.
this is michael.
they would not make it unless people liked it.
okay, oh okay, okay.
because i guess I am the only aphrodisiac she needs.
hey, alright, you know what, clearly I am outnumbered here, but can i just say one thing, please?
what?
hello!
last gift.
yes.
i read about something like that.
uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
he did talk about a fire in the warehouse...  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
um, everybody, we are going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
i have work to do.
will you help her find them, please?
miserably.
whiner.
i did.
okay.
it is cheaper.
right?
you call that diversity training?
it is pretty funny when you think about it.
entourage!
in japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.
reinstituting casual friday?
on me.
lovely!
i love it!
and i decided, I am going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
here is the thing.
soccer ball and cleats.
yes.
hey.
he is everything I am not and everything i am.
what difference does it make?
and the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter.
yes.
how do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "i told you so."  gently with a rose?
just tell me what happened.
here he is.
a point is not a say.
this kid had the magazine i wanted to read, that is the only one i could reach and i read it and then i read it again.
see?
got it.
oh.
nope.
because with them, it is an everyday stand and i still know their names in the morning.
let us get it started!
but cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.
yes, this is beth.
whoa!
if you had one word you would use to describe darryl what would that word be?
want some pie?
let us take a look at what he is doing, everybody!
for me, too.
well if you take a look at this, i tented my pants.
part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
or obama twins?
but we are going on a booze cruise on lake wallenpaupack.
i have a lot of ideas for new directions.
how would you even know?
and this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
michael scott, regional manager, dunder mifflin.
it is very sad.
you and your wife, and you have kids.
so you have come to the master for guidance?
it is a miracle, you are at your desk.
time to stop being polite and get real.
and just to be sure, i asked her again afterward.
perfect.
i do not romanticize th-  no... he had no arms or legs, he could not hear see, or speak... this is how he let a nation.
no, it did not.
here is an attaboy for ya!
best night ever.
got my great pizza.
because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to.
hey, hey craigers, my man!
she was very hot.
i think i made that very clear in the fliers, fun, f-you-n. well, i think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
kelly.
um, sure, i will get you the best iced tea in the world.
you know, that is not what you want.
the purpose for this meeting is to take pam's mind off of what is going on inside of her body.
ok. good.
a month?
I am going to get married and I am going to have kids.
oh-okay, you are not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
i show her an image that turns her on.
sue me!
oh hey, i want to show you something.
very ambitious.
chili's is the new golf course.
and i picked... the... former.
seriously, do you want me to just cancel the dundies?
but, santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
right, snuggle time.
no you are not.
cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight.
would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?
yeah, I have been pretty much skating my whole life.
erin, i want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables.
let us go.
at all.
doobie-doobie doo.
the small business man?
they are into style.
alright, in my defense... shut up oscar.
oh, hey.
and that your glasses make you look ugly.
and we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.
come on, shake it up.
they will eat it up.
ryan has done a very good job, and i am not applauding sarcastically.
it is time to motivate.
yes.
yes.
oh god, oh, alfredo sauce.
hey.
ah!
as much as i might want to.
nah, you rock.
i do not know if i should say... stanly is having a midlife crisis.
or the other sandals, jamaica.
thank you!
hey gang.
ok. ok. hey.
if that is your real name.
blood everywhere.
hey.
family style.
here we go.
now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so i can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast.
ahh come on!
get out of the way!
i can not finish.
no, no.
is that pam?
um... that was not much of an introduction.
well, i think we all know what you are capable of meredith.
it is a setup.
i think you are underestimating pam.
i think we work better separately.
you are really getting this place.
ok. well, here i am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training.
they have their own little language now.
forever.
i destroyed 15 young lives today.
there is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head.
where the hell is that?
and you know why not?
you guys ever protect the president?
alright, you are going to miss the best prank ever.
who?
i lost everybody's jobs.
come on, everybody.
yeah, that is true.
you went over my head.
ok. bop bop de bope bop bop bop bop bop.
oh!
"name three businesses that have a better health care plans than dunder mifflin."  here is the problem.
ok, yes that would be bad.
it is a summer christmas sale-abration.
is there another option?
our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
of course.
i- okay, this whole going over my head-gate?
oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?
that is it.
all right.
next-ish.
you are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to angela that made her feel uncomfortable.
that is a pun.
and i can prove it.
you forged the forms!
I am sorry, just a sec.
growing up, i always thought i would become an actor.
excited to talk ideas.
it is not.
nonono, no, no, i do not want to hear moaning.
what this is is a business that i have worked toward my entire life.
i did.
mmm.
we are, uh, we are doing okay.
i know.
andy is like marv something.
america's eighth largest indigenous body of water.
plus, there is some other good news.
you said it!
okay?
kevin?
this is not a game, this is my life.
hey.
what if she makes me?
but seriously, if you break that girl's heart i will literally kill you and your entire family.
really?
do not talk about nazis in front of-- you know what?
what is a pap smear?
no.
hello.
let me see if i have his cell.
i hope it is understood that that will be our only topic of discussion.
: hey, you ready?
and if i know darryl, it going to be zoppity.
and i have another one of them in the nude.
well... you are...you know what?
thank you.
sometimes the smartest people do not think at all.
i was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
there you go steaming hot cup of joe.
so, she was like 'i do not have my id, please give me one.' and he was like 'i can not do that.
goodnight!
they are way too focused on work.
thank you.
thank you.
you listen to me.
everyone, may i have your attention?
no.
come on.
i do not think i did.
you are out of order, sir.
"a particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute--" yes.
a man you have missed with all your heart.
ok. alright, alright.
and also, chitty chitty bang bang.
i was hoping that i would have new york style sushi today.
wondering if i could, uh, get your help for something.
did you raise benefits?
yeah, you should see her naked.
I am doing this for you.
phyllis, i do not have acne.
you know?
it is just... there is no stalking it.
okay.
pam!
bingo!
good.
i am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts.
my feelings do not matter to you.
well, what?
i will go first.
my heart's still racing.
i do not get it.
come on!
they have him surrounded.
there she is.
i do not want to hear anything more from you.
from dwight.
i really messed up.
there are not no party like a scranton party, because a scranton party do not stop.
because I am the boss.
it is $1.99 to finish the article.
and it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.
and laughter... also.
oh, wow!
that is such good news.
that makes a lot more sense.
so, take it away.
i am downloading some n3p... music... for a cd mix tape... for holly.
we actually went to the poconos last tuesday.
woman in every port.
pam, please?
well, now I am in a terrible mood.
what can i say?
assemble a sales team.
she is a beaut!
oh, wow, wow.
attention, all problem sales persons.
it is not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents.
oh do you?
leave me alone, okay?
are there any words you would like to say, on pam's behalf?
i groomed him.
you do not have to, january this contract says it all.
look, about you and jim.
he went right by!
all right.
i understand.
if you do not have a pet, please do not feel like - ah, yes, the leads.
oh, man.
we are going to call them, we are going to put them on speakerphone right now... and we are going to straighten this out.
not... so, your desk is... right.
god!
ok, well payroll is in charge of all that.
catcher or in field?
yeah, i guess it is not so bad.
maybe all of them.
no, I am just poopin'.
who likes to water ski on lake erie?
so just tell her to go away.
pb and j, my mom's recipe!
hey.
i do not want to die!
wha-so-i do not understand, you want to see other people.
um, let us see.
no billy, i have not done that dance since my wife died.
so, phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now i am recruiting you.
do not drink and drive.
he is beautiful.
i do not want to get ahead of myself, but i think i want her to meet my mom.
aaaah... weird.
so you would not mind permanently relocating, so that packer can take this desk here.
yes.
I am on the phone, please.
very inspirational.
so did creed.
no.
hey.
she did it!
arrrgggh!
well, you know... maybe you should go to business school like ryan, then... then you would know what you are talking about.
yeah.
and another thing i did this summer, i hired my nephew.
I am trying to get everyone excited about phyllis' wedding because i want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.
listen, david, i would like to do this ad in house.
i would love that.
what is it, then?
oscar, you are- okay, you know what?
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
that is it.
what are you doing?
well, no.
let us try this.
that is me.
not great.
and hates your body.
yeah!
you would not understand.
yeah.
okay, we are trapped.
it could be... a... thingamajig.
besides my shirt tail covered most of it so... that is not gross, it is the human body.
that face, how ugly he was?
oh, that is not appropriate.
well, he is just mean.
feels good.
walk much?
what is better than giving presents?
i just assumed you would be familiar with it.
open for business!
come on, sales, over here.
well, all right.
get back to work, dwight.
nice outfit.
oh, have you not?
did not he say that?
yes, phyllis?
can you hear me, they talk about us... hey, What are you gettin'?
they put a hate note under my windshield wiper.
we have talking walls.
all right, ok. i love babies.
that is a lot of zeroes.
my mistake.
you think it was good?
I am not blind!
step up there.
go buy some more.
guy's gripe session.
it is okay.
I am going to go in there and tell her that we can not be together.
i was not attempting to compliment you.
target.
we need to sell her an elevator pass.
bye.
mmm.
I have been putting money into cds for years.
well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and i just do not... i do not know.
they did this great profile last month of doris roberts and where she likes to eat when she is in phoenix.
i live by one rule.
see ya.
oh wow another living room!
three.
grief counseling is not about, "are you hungry?
no, i know they fit.
you do not know.
what am i supposed to do with that, dwight?
how about that?
uh... alright.
actually, it is polite to arrive early.
yes.
mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
and then i spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme.
absolutely.
no michael here, my name is- no, you shut up.
here we go.
you are kind of... dupee-doo, dupee-do.
my boo, holly.
who is that sportscaster that bit that lady?
killing my hand, there.
I am not going to make this call.
bye.
day 45, company saved.
did you get the memo about dressing your best?
i know.
please, do not.
well, here is the thing.
i changed it.
moral.
yes!
i... i did not do that.
oh, how are you?
nah, I am good.
dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest.
let us, yes?
oh, okay, here is a good one.
i know.
oh... oh god.
i am.
let us do it.
where would we even drop it, phyllis?
ha ha!
I am just lucky i got out.
but i want you to get pumped about this corner idea.
how is this place treating you?
oh!
you want to hit me, you want to punch me?
your pay is just different.
because he is going to own his own business.
ok, alright.
wha- what?
wait, when did we start talking about the mob?
"this morning, i knocked myself in the head with the phone." "every time i typed my name, it said 'diapers'." "by the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier." the japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard.
no, i am talking about a roast!
it was my dream.
you are cured.
got one of each.
look, if i was gay, i would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.
please, just leave.
better put on your ski boots!
i like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.
borat.
that good?
god.
whenever.
what is a nazi?
oh yay!
what is wrong with me?
alright.
enough is enough, I am - god, I am so mad!
no, i think i would be bad.
and i bring to you glad christmas tidings.
yes, this is... this is looking good.
no problem.
just keep living your lives.
oh heyyy.
write that down.
okay.
t-back.
that is right, you worked with him.
plenty of space in the parking lot, spot.
okay, bye bye.
break this down.
i am.
4 times x 2. what is double 4?
terrible news.
you have to pay for the actual course.
what'cha talking about?
mhmm.
oooookay.
who else knows?
although last time... she pretended she did not hear me.
they were.
nein!
and that is it.
another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
jim, what you do not understand is that this company's worthl- no- we do not have- uh... yes.
oh come on, you are ruining it.
angela loves pussy cats, and packer loves- i was going to say dogs!
uh... try "password".
could you take-.
it- yep, recently.
he is just not tough enough.
oh... that is going to change.
carol, i just... i feel like... i just like you so much.
well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect.
they should not be given the choice.
oscar's a douche.
I have never done this before.
heart is.
oh, thank you.
do you realize what we are losing?
no no, we are fine.
i just um, i just want to let you know that i am going to go to your lamaze class tomorrow.
jim, right here, jim!
memo to january i deserve a raise.
who is there?
but then i got an e-mail from ryan, that he was coming back to town.
let us take a look at the tape.
then... youtube gets a hold of it... you are right.
it is the hindu festival of lights.
you are going to have some tequila, my friend.
no, no, no, you do not need to go anywhere.
all right.
we will talk about it later.
you need a break.
psst!
tomorrow i want everyone to have a good time.
oh, hey what is this?
am i michael scott?
we are not doing anything.
all right?
okay, you know what i thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
and i just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive.
how are you?
oh.
she would just resent me.
you can not outrun your problems.
i was soft inside, there was something going on.
that would never happen.
hold tight.
see?
okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, kevin.
affirmative.
no, no, no.
okay.
pam i have a loaded gun in my desk at work.
okay.
i disagree, i think it was very valuable.
if we do not say anything she is not going to get any better.
there is such a thing as good grief.
it is how they wrestle in a blow-up suit...  that will tell me all i need to know  or how sumo... david!
you know, give yourself an exam.
think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen.
i know exactly who he is.
come on.
but not very many people know that.
you suck!
stop it, stop it.
I am your party captain too!
I am with the fbi.
you are a good worker, and a good man.
i want to show you something .
because we quit.
pam told me.
no matter how i look at this, i am in the wrong.
okay.
this situation all up in here is what is messed up!
he loves... other things as well.
oh, okay.
because he slept in the car a couple times.
and we screwed.
do you think we are going to have sex tonight?
if it is consensual.
okay.
ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo!
okay, hold on.
I am sorry.
may i?
oh god!
i know, dwight.
hey.
he will be here in a sec.
that is a "t", and there is another one right there.
i sent away for it in july from a catalog.
okay.
yeah, well, at least he was married.
i am serious.
good!
because you are in a wheelchair.
how?
no, it -  what will be the state of this company if i am the only one coming up with the great ideas?
kind of a less urban aunt jemima.
because at the end of the night, brad or angelina would have to come and pick him up and i would get to meet them.
you brought it on yourself.
that is great.
if anything i gave it to her.
okay?
that is not how i taught you, right?
you give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would.
i do not think I am overstating it when i say that toby is a plague on this company.
where were you this morning?
and you will know, that you are home.
we are okay, jim!
the job was not mine to give.
it is a disgusting sandwich.
so without further ado,   i would like to start saying my goodbyes  okay.
so let us just go with mine.
do you?
that is bull crap.
ugh.
let us be professional, all right?
it is fun.
whenever you come into the office i want you to think about this.
you are coming with me.
no?
no.
i mean anybody could be gay.
yeah.
that is my car.
site blockers.
deck the halls with boughs of holly.
it is just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so potential, lots of potential.
we are going to... why are you the way that you are?
if it is stanley's, call the offices of james p. albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
oh come on.
find out if there is a way to tell by just looking at them.
they took my card away because i spent $80 bucks at a magic shop.
but it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.
hmmm-hmm-hmm.
did i ever tell you about the day that steve martin died?
well that is... because... i am a genius.
inspiring words.
you know who is the worst?
he threw  them on the ground!
on a friday?
ooo, bleh bleh bleh.
emeril.
we should really do something fun this week.
and a close personal friend of mine, jim halpert!
you are... yeah.
why do not you grow something that everybody does like?
all right, call- ok, no, no, no, no, no, no.
congratulations on being a grandma.
dwight's a jerk!
everybody.
ok, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.
uh, yes.
oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.
ah, dwight can i get you a drink?
but upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so i threw it away.
phyllis, we are going to put you in here.
you know what time it is?
that... is miss trudy.
it is ok. we are having fun.
i think you are doing a great job.
i mean, what sort of place is that to call home?
he is on the roof!
well, it looks like there is going to be a clean-up on aisle five.</i> I am not here to learn how to mop, I am here to learn how to play hockey.
is it stanley?
you knock and then you wait for the all clear.
right.
two ladies at once.
I am prison mike!
yeah, well, that is just a pick-up scene.
any messages?
got enough, weirdo?
so sue me... no, do not sue me.
jim?
i do!
we do not have the technology.
"you down with the dundies?
win/win.
here we go!
you are a good, good guy.
ohhh happy birthday jim!
all right, happy friday.
why do not you just go... away?
toby is the instruction card you throw away.
all day long.
no, no, no.
I am leavin' inside jim's car, i do not know when I will be back again.
can i speak to a manager then?
and thank god I am not darryl.
right now, get in the conference room.
I will find somebody i have not slept with.
you respect dibs, do not you?
i will give you that.
I am superman!
you know how i be.
thank you.
good?
really?
and.
thank you santa.
let us go in here.
sweet.
I am going to kill you for firing me.
well,  busier.
everybody settled in?
want to see it?
all right, listen up, please.
she was from europe.
ryan?
oooooh, my life!
do not be ridiculous.
the mind has to wrap around the foot.
wow, look at that fine craftsmanship.
I am going to start dating her even harder.
oh, sure.
erin, call an ambulance, please!
this thing... indestructible.
yeah, I am definitely getting in.
but you ruined it.
no, really.
oh phyllis, nice try.
here comes the airplane, there you go.
i can not... vouch for that.
no, it will not be.
no, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around.
stop.
we destroy the evidence.
bastard!
oh.
who wants candy?
i hate her.
i only give my organs to my real friends.
we are dying here.
i miss you.
that got infected even though i peed on it.
then, mr. driver, we are off like a herd of turtles!
shall we?
umm, let me ask you this: how many people exist in the world?
i think i know how to ride a bike.
you told me that several times.
for realsies.
oh god!
gabe, just go and have fun with erin.
I am on it, do not worry.
there sat jim.
how dare you sir.
that is full of soup.
goodbye toby!
hi.
bam!
do not bother luke.
we heard it.
it is my two-weeks... hank?
and i got us reservations at cooper's seafood.
you will have to be more specific dwight, i get like eight emails a day.
i just, i do not see the connection between a firewalk and management.
to see the ones that you love.
bad idea.
okay, ready?
this is mike tyson.
look at her.
who is playing with the button?
just take it back.
i wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because i was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
but, i would like you to take notes.
this is a lifelong dream.
movin' on.
dwight!
I am just reading it out loud.
yeesh... ok i want you to be darryl and ask me for a raise, because i want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
i said that yesterday.
i want these people to really pay, i want them to suffer.
jan levinson gould.
okay.
i am the big boss now.
you think she would talk to you?
you did not see it, pam.
yes you can.
yeah.
no one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
party.
come on man, that is disgusting dwight!
ah!
he is going to swallow is tongue.
hey, hey hey, calm down.
this is where i fell in love with you.
avrile lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
that you are afraid.
give-okay.
so, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
ok. this is the last <i>thing</i> that phyllis needs to see right now, dwight.
we will.
hey, oscar!
you... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by...  and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well... one more time.
i mean, he knows exactly how you are feeling.
that guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
eric likes megan.
come on!
what are you doing?
if dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance.
and the sexy looks between you and pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it is creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.
she is very conservative.
whoo kay.
corcroan dropped staples.
but i need you to come and pick me up.
the jamaicans do not have a word for "impossible." how hard is a luau?
are we, do you think?
it is six a.m.  and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their dundie nomination certificates.
people are tolerant!
nope.
okay, skippy, here we go.
here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
I am a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately.
i do not need your permission.
yeah, well, stanley does not help with anything.
come on!
hey, mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, brunch!
i have invited barbara allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.
ok, come on, let us get our shower on.
that is not- all right, all right... okay.
and they will control us.
lion king!
the boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised.
you are going to hate it.
look... hey, toby.
bah!
i want you to switch desks, I am going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything!
andy, what time's the show?
i mean this is really serious stuff.
conflict!
and then we can break out  my gift to you-complimentary white chocolate bark.
we have cable readiness.
hey.
it is comfort food, all right?
that is just what i call him, so... i am by far the most qualified person they are interviewing.
anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
what have i learned from all of this?
that is what she said.
because, frankly, it is just a different sensation.
you can not, i have a thing tonight.
mmm... dah.
i... and i, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
that was a little touch and go at first but i think we saved it.
you are very... .
but here is the thing: yes, we can.
and as much as i think you are a great guy, and i like you, you are... you are, goodbye.
I would really like some sushi.
would you like to come to work for the michael scott paper company?
working in an office can lead to depression.
that is all yours.
are we going some place far away?
you and me.
if people can not carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?
you know who my favorite character in toy story is?
hey, looks great babe.
sorta like...a little younger version of me.
no, neither am i. we both look good.
so you would think that is a good idea for me to do?
what is her number?
there you go, fresh from the warehouse.
alright.
meredith palmer!
gruel omelettes.
oh, um, well, we could have ryan take a look.
you are... it is, it is bugging me.

he was the worst.
it is hairless.

glee?
wow.
i am going to be better.
she has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.

the year before that, i also came as monica lewinsky.
please stop.
that is the inside of your vagina!
well, it is...  no, do not cry, it is going to be ok. i do not know.
not at all.
i want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine.
i think not!
okay, well, I will have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
see you later.
it may seem like a good idea, but it is not.
deangelo's great.
i liked her jumpers.
tonight is the dundies, the annual employee awards night here at dunder mifflin.
probably the best advice you ever gave me, dwight.
what do you think?
i thought i would be by the time i was 30, but i was not even close.
jim, big fire in your house.
this young man needs to learn that is not how you treat people.
no, no, no.
can you believe that?
unfinished.
very fair and very kind.
i just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
skeevy little perv.
green means go, so i know to go ahead and shut up about it.
okay.
300 going once.
that is... you know what.
no.
no, no, no.
um... ryan?
what bar?
it should just come about effortlessly.
like the movie.
what is the matter with you?
how?
felt much stronger yesterday.
alright.
i marked her arm.
we get the 45 points we are back in business.
ok. alright, after you.
that was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... it was supposed to be with bills and it does not work great with faxes.
do not let yourself down, andy.
what did he say?
what about oscar?
it is like, urine goes all over the place.
ok. not today, ok?
you do not have to stay if you do not want to.
oh, my god.
yes.
ok, be more specific.
society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong.
holly is right.
divorce.
and every morning i would watch the sunrise and i would eat a mango.
thank you.
nothing, i just... nothing.
do you think the world is crawling with phyllises?
it is probably the best idea anybody has ever had.
ok. thirty minutes or less, please come back.
that sounds pretty biased.
anything you want to tell us?
"dear mr. scott.
racial message?
do i just ignore it, or?
guys, guys... you can not believe everything you hear.
he either proposes by new year's or they break up.
shout it out.
you guys are all gigantic losers.
i ruv you very much!
boom.
here we go.
i can do it good.
it could be my race, could be the fact that I am so fit, or I am a womanizer... fair game.
intercepted.
phew, freaked myself out this morning.
why?
when holly gets here, i want you to be very helpful to her.
you are the best gd girlfriend in the world.
good luck.
i dare you.
do you think she is already dating a different aj?
so we are talking constantly all the way.
but i would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
hi.
but, it turns out, i was still a little angry.
thank you.
so... oh, donna?
no... that is... i do not... um... i can not hear your conversation.
let us just... all right.
ok.  where we going?
a man who has ruined all other men for you.
yeah.
she was kind of tripping me up, because she was, um, i was trying to get something going, when i was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.
that is a drive!
hi.
i am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet donna.
pam stepped up.
right.
yeah, ok.  well, he only gets better.
we are just office drones.
no, no.
the sales department smashed my sandwich.
hey, everybody!
whoo!
waaaah!

I am in the interior of the vast pennsylvania wilderness.
could you put these on the board?
how rude!
do not bring that lamb to work or it will poop on the floor.
oh, here we go!
we could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move... i think that is a great way to honor ed.
because that is how my mind works.
i am actually your boss, michael scott.
yeah.
i want everybody to take a look to their left.
enjoy.
finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing i have ever had to do.
play some games?
i got it.
you just said, let me uh... check my notes.

you want to see some really high caliber acting?
i think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.
alright.
actually, they just do not get very much work done when I am not here.
what kind of stuff is that?
where I am from, two types of folk: those who are not, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper.
idiot.
well, we are running a business, so.
ok.  phyllis, you say?
okay.

there is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea.
dwight, come on.
i believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as darryl.
that was great.
did he say something?
i thrive on it.
i wish the windows were not tinted so people could see us in here.
and that is not me being mean, dwight.
you are just going to somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what is going to be on your tombstone?
all right, well, go find some.
unicorn walks into the office, "oh, do you have an appointment?"  okay, look pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you are doing wrong.

it is not going to be tacky.
blind guy.
i mean, there is my... window, and there is my car!

i- i just want to say that i cannot believe that i walked into a koi pond.
who the hell is this?
so meredith and i have just started conversing and i will say, "so meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?" all right... okay, okay.
fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.

hmm?
tiny little crack in her pelvis.
this is so stupid.
what?
i say that is crazy.
and now packer wants to come home.
i am also considering stanley because of all the good that black people have done.
and you can tell all your friends that if i see them, then they are already dead." i said something like that.
thank you.
public tv is bust.
not even close.
that is meredith, the birthday girl.
i will gladly pay you tuesday for a hamburger today.
oh, time and resources.
how are your sales doing?
big butt, bigger heart.
yeah?
you see that?
that is what i said.
alright, let us get back to work.
did you see holly's butt?
my little heart can barely take it no more.
you want a real horse?
no, just get me a case.
so is there a guy or, uh, a person.
well, to have kelly explain it  it is ada blah blah blah, it is so super fun and it is going to be great.
so, like a freedom tree.
oh, these do not taste like oysters.
umm, can i pay you tomorrow?
ryan, you lived in new york, what do you think?
do you?
I am willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
well, then... consider it poisoned beef.
according to a 2004 study!
the story about me getting into improv was that i was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says "hey you are funny, you are the funniest guy I have ever seen, or my name is not dale earnhardt."   and that was an improv.
ms. beasley if yer nastay!
a gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do i.  no, seriously, guys, I am not, i do not want to go into it at all.
i have some bad news.
yep.
here is the thing.
i need you to see this.
holly thinks that this relationship is over.
no no, all right.
over forty billion.
like that, uh, dwarf from lord of the rings.
it is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.
ok, here we go.
yeah.
let us get down to business.
i need to find ways to push meredith to the bottom.
sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
and i am in the wedding party.
alright, alright, alright, okay.
holly broke up with a.j last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me.
find a box for him.
he is following up.
you think you would have done better without me?
nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best i guess.
p-a-m. p-a no it is okay, we are talking code.
this office is the american dream.
just the two of us?
no agenda.
you enjoy the second act.
um, yeah.
oh, my.
toy story.
not as good as you think.
because i assumed that you want me to be happy because i want you to be happy.
no, no, no.
yeah!
way to go!
oh yeah, i guess i did let him be a robot.
uh, you are foir-ed." it just makes people sad, and an office can not function that way.
a crossword puzzle stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
well then everybody'll chip in, it will be fine.
i think he is.
you are damn creative.
was this a sorority that you did not get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
you ever think of that?
c'mere, c'mere, c'mon!
the toast is really not supposed to be about anything.
no, god, no it is not!
i do not care whether you hate it!
jeez, that is good.
say-ber.
heck, pam would have done it.
ohh explosion!
she used to work for hr?
come on, stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
eat it!
whatever.
what is that letter, right there?
it was only five dollars.
every single one.
he has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that?
but do you realize that underneath us, there is another world.
'a luh-whooooo a za her'.
i will do all the talking.
pack your bags, we are leaving the day-after-tomorrow!
uh, nope.
is there something that you would like to say to me?
i will do it.
where is kevin?
well, let me check captain.
a horse.
can you imagine if i wrote something like, uh, "oh, meredith.
"...into the workplace.
okay.
so, i respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.
and i understand that you would want to just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
my name's michael scott.
did some research.
it is a terrible year for love.
ah, so when did you set up shop?
agreed?
you look like a clown!
umm, it is all-inclusive... william randolph shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I am paraphrasing here, "love doth be poison." brilliant.
oh.
ok, ok. you know what?
if my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt.
oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!
yeah?
jim halpert... dwight schrute... intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch.
throw a tv over, or... go buy some watermelons.
ladies and gentlemen!

triple your investment by january.
african-americans!
okay!
are you clicking a detonator?
I am really scared.
stuff happens, right?
ah, good stuff, good stuff.
no.
what does that mean?
he, well...  tell you about toby later, he is awful.
where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and i just did not feel like a priority.
got it.
"you need to do something about your b.of." ok, i do not know who this suggestion is meant for, but it is more of a personal suggestion and it is not an office suggestion.
it is like don rickles on acid, man.
good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!
because everybody says so.
all right.
oh.
this puts us at threat level midnight.
phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I am the real thing.
I am like, what?
the "hottest in the office" award goes to... ...ryan the temp!
well, it was a thought.
let us celebrate diversity.
ok, everybody listen up.
oh, you move on.
you have got the life, my friend.
this is what we are going to do.
what is wrong with these people?
ouch.
what?
you know what?
look.
look at him - t-shirt, jeans... i am flattered.
this morning, danny cordray stole a sale from me.
alright?

no, okay... I have had enough of you.
bop!
phyllis, jim?
oh good.
oh, this guy is out of control!
we have the dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it is sexy, it is sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?
simple...  kids love candy bars.

all i need... no, dwight!
that is not- okay- that is day-to-day.
try my googi, googi.
other than by using magic.
ok, you know what?
I am just going to leave right now.
and shake!
all right!
p's being a giant b. they always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right!
we are going to take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.
yes!
what do you mean by "these people"?
and in order to be healthy, you have to eat, kelly.
mmm... okay.
just keep it.
not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
you follow that guy to the people who is really really bad.
that was nice of you.
are we ready for the game?
let us stay here.
this is just the front of her.
do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?
I am not, i need you to act like i am firing him.
pam...you are missing things.
oh god.
wow, that is- thanks so much.

dwight, there was wind.
...poop my pants.

merry christmas!
unh-unh.
i say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension.
just talk!
okay, hypothetical: a man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots.
erin, look.
the key to a crisis is dealing with it right away.
i just miss you so much.
thanks.
i- a watch would be nice.
i wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars.
they had visual aids.
if you are watching this, that means I am already dead.
well, pam and i have eloped.
well, deal with this.
no, no, five seconds!
dwight.

no.
the electric city.
you must be andy bernard.
and today they are being distracted by the other booths.
well, that is probably from the test drive.
you have the day off.
i do not think i would have been able to endure my breakup with holly had it not been for toss across.
i do not swing that way.
yeah.
we are all best friends - i love everybody here.
i just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing.
fourteen years.

well, i am heading down there.
angela.
you have the floor, ryan.

after 19 years.
gould was stupid.
yes.
okay, you know what?
alright, well, i guess this is where we leave you off.
they are cool.
come on.
okay, good suggestions.
dwight!
tell me if I am smiling or not.
that makes sense because he has elfish features.
i would give that lecture a solid b+.
you are back.
only really good friends show up early.
ok, alright.
and now we are wasting tape.
snip snap!
kelly, look at me!
you are right.
and i would not let my family go hungry.
you do not have to tell them.
fun fact.
so roy is actually going to be marrying pam sometime this summer.
pam 6.0. oh, look.
for real.
runaway and I am never coming back.
he is doing just fine.
are you still here?
no it is not.
oh, well.
she made me do a lot of things i did not want to do.
and i want what i want.
when i said before that i was king of forwards, you got to understand that i do not come up with this stuff.
you... you get this check.
next suggestion: "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression".
well i wrote them down so i would not forget.
i am fast!
hey ryan?
you are bailing on me.
it is okay.
self fulfilling prophecy.
this is nice.
dwight, i will be leaving tomorrow.
no, no , no, you know what?
these are not my shoes.
um... that is what i was thinking, with the farm, so... you getting to wherever I am going to put my thing.
i just forward it along.
this is michael scott.
maybe i did.
too much formaldehyde!
you know, just a little bit of money.
michael.
ummm, well I would have to talk to my mother and my guy at h and r block.
it is bad taste.
you have to keep score.
this is not my fault.

buddha.
it is bad.
it was not pretty.
no.
so would you guys like some lemonade?
narc!

what do you think?
here we go.
glad i remembered that.
you are very charming.
so what you are saying is you kind of like it?
you know who my favorite character is?
buena vista oscar.
that is why there were so many people there.
may you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
I am pretty sure we said slap.
diwali is a very important holiday for the hindus.
am i correct?
vamanos!
sort of a brangelina thing.
boo!
roasted.
okay, hey, you already have the job.
not today, kevin.
roasted.
shhh hot, why did not you get an air-condition-- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
pillow talk.
if i give you your clients back there will not be enough clients for ryan and pam, and i promised both of them they were going to be salespeople.
that ties right into new attitudes.
yeah, i think we should head out.
because the book said it is best to wait till the end of the day.
i do not have to buy it.
oh, thank you.
ok, game on, man.
i am makin' it happen, sergeant.
i do not get no respect!
one, two... find a key.
all right.
hmm.
right?
snl?
i do not think so, no.
there are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.
i think it is very apparent.
oh, that is gross.
ok. hey, hey why do not you run it by me and I will run it by him.
ok, i think that is good.
there goes mister poop.
come on.
oh, that sounds awful.
i took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life.
I am just saying be careful.
no.
you are lying right now.

it is what is for dinner!
your stomach?
we are, we are a family.
good, good, good.
tell them that I am in a meeting.
nice touch.
ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: assst... ...trid levinson.
somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
dwight's going to be able to build himself a friend!
...i say you will miss our service, and i absolutely guarantee you will come back.
what uh- wow, you are kidding me!
we take separate cars.
stanley!
a murder, you say?
blessed be those who sit and wait.
ok. um, well, did you get the second email that i sent?
how about no arms?
where did that day go?
that is what we have been looking for.
no!
you tell him that you are his friend and that you are going to help him and that everyone is going to be all right.
so we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
oh.
i do.
pam.
nobody wants it!
500.

not really, look i do not know how to say this so i just will.
ok. so, let us dish.
now I am out there, and i wish i was in here.

I would go with the rows.
decisiveness.
we already have packer on the road.
lynn was as hot as erin.

i am jetting off on an international business trip.
i just have a very exciting offer.
prove it.
you call it.
time out, time out, time out, time out, time out.

i am saying... that... maybe i was drunk.
oh, all right!
today is safety training day.
close your eyes.
we did it!
come here.
today's a big day.
would you have sex with meredith?
stop that.
why on earth would we give you a raise?
they have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free.
they say that laughter is the best medicine so stanley, you can throw away those pills.
i had not planned on including him.
and at some point, the daddy can not take a bath with the kids anymore.
reservation for michael scott.
well how do you think i feel?
this would be a huge coupe people.
this is pam beesly,  receptionist extraordinaire.
it is the end of the month, and i was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.
uh oh.
life is precious.
i can not really explain it.
oh my god.
i will play the chris rock guy.
here is a kelly complaint: "ryan never returns my calls." ugh, join the club.
i recognize that.
that is josh and dwight and jim.
and the bottom line, i am in the wrong.
packer was here and so was your mom!
and i am in!
really?
easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
oh, what are those?

lost log.
it is hard for me to imagine a scenario, where meredith palmer keeps her job and david wallace does not - no offense meredith.
sorry to interrupt.
i want to buy them from you.
and kevin and stanley, if you do not stop worrying so much about what you are going to put in your gullet, you are going to die in about a month.
no, i think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
oh no!
I am just saying if they did throw their hats I have got a great line for that: "may your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... that was a pretty good line.
yaaaaay.
i come here.
yeah.
reese's pieces.
i need your sage advice.
but she is coming by today.
nick, i had a dream last night that i had two full time jobs.

i really like you.
so, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology.
yeah, okay.
you can not have it.
nice.
is this done?
and i knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense i had no idea what to do.
it was packer!
phyllis!
well, i am just glad this is all over.
i just found out today.
umm... alright.
and make it your own.
so stupid!
ah.

what matters is that christmas is fun, right?

no, it is for me, bimbo.
she was the love of my life.
teamwork!
or, it could be... a bruce springsteen fan - what?
look at his face!
we have a day honoring martin luther king, but he did not even work here.
well I am sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so i appreciate you meeting with us here today.
um... we have to watch, uh, toby's video that he is showing us in order to brainwash us and i was wondering if anybody would like to join in?
sound good?
what do you expect me to do?

that is what i say, so... meredith, bad breath.
i hope she does not call us up on stage.
i know.
alright.
i would like them to meet my new girlfriend.
that looked like it was going to be good.
they are a great audience.
okay.
you are invited to go as well.
i did not see it at home, i did not see it in the bathroom, i did not see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light... the big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?

that is what... let us do it!
i want you to meet a great guy, and i want you to be happy.

when larry king died they did not just cancel his show.
I am burned!

is there someone there?
are not you going to ask me how jamaica was?
oh, no, no, no... oh my god.
yes, it does.
they sit in big piles of garbage.
ok. to what do i owe this great honor, david wallace?
he is not a big fan of me dropping by announced.
wow.
well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why do not you just throw one away now into my mouth?
we will go clubbing with ryan.
i could frame yours too.
i did!
ok. who else?
hello.
oh, so this is what every day would be like if you had not left india.
nuhh... oh, ok. you are welcome.
you were right jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.

you know what?
get the car ready, keep the engine running.
alright, find a cozy spot.
did you check it?
but the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again.
tons of personal e-mails, huge time wasters.
you can not quit!
dwight, can i talk to you for a second?
i am a theatrical person.
i do not know.
i can also make it the sky.

you can do this.
no.
I have seen her seven times in the last few months, and I am growing very fond of her kids.

okay, you know what, this is over!
I am in the best shape of my life.
no.
now that is going on?
i think it is because they respect me.
it is not your business, dwight.
well... pretty weird.
i really did.
oh, alright, yeah.
and it is really not about me, it is about my grandkids, it is about my great grandkids... i can come back here when I am 100, and i can find that piece of cement and say, "that is me.
because you do not get health care.
okay.
oh, anything bad?

and now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale!
oh, man.
let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
fresh and new.
all right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative.
hey.
i want you to get in line.
how does this happen?
do my time.

when it goes off, no more kissing.
that is what she said.
erin, you are supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
no, no, no, no, no.
any suggestions?
you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand.

we are wedged between the copier and the railing.
but of that group, 782 have viewed it.
is that the beak!?
his name was devon.
how could... right in the middle of the carpet.
and this is the foreman.
eghh, she is crazy.
thank you.
shh.
i guess the atmosphere that I have created here is that I am a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.
i want to do all six hours today.
yes, yeah, absolutely.
look at that face.
shut it.
sue me.
yeah.
and we widen to reveal ancient rome.
now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.

i just, you know, times are tight.
nothing.
but i have learned even more about love.
ho-ho, man!
you guys have thought about this a lot more than i have.

i just want to taste it.
okay...  oh, no, no, no, no!
here is-here is my point.
ohhh, what have we here?
wow.
did darryl touch you?
whassup!
abraham lincoln once said that, "if you are a racist, i will attack you with the north." and those are the principles... damn it.
it was the warehouse guys... ... dwight, they embarrassed us... ... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
i have bags under my eyes, and i can not go to new york like this!
stanley.
call him in.
you work in paper long enough, you get to know the players.
show us what you have learned today.
i need your urine.
yes, well, we are not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
I will give you a hint.
is that too much to ask?
oh... meredith, why do not you tell holly... it is not what she thinks.
atlantic city, ok?
nope.
a company runs on efficiency of communication, right?
occasionally I will hit somebody with my car.
really?
yes.
put my heart out there.
could you come in here for a sec?
things with donna are so... oh-ho-ho!
sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
we are not done.
oh, that is a shame.
you will never get away with this!
thank you.
how many of you have at one time gone to toby to complain about another employee?
the triumph of the will.
your friend got engaged.
i have to know whether you are serious or not.
but here is what we are going to do.
must be thinking about retirement.
hmm.. well, look, i am in an assigned parking place in front, so... alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.
i think I am growing into a giant.
god.
dwight get rid of the tree.
and you are fun.
yeah.
i need silence or sam kinison to prepare.
it is done.
but in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
and i... i bet he has nothing to do with that!
good because this batch was awful.
i need you to get me the prices that you are charging ed's tires so i can undercut dunder mifflin.
i need three, maybe two.
yeah!
dozens of online iq test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing is not tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight.
tomorrow.
all right.
hey.
and i do not think she is ever pooped in her life.
no, you do not.
hahaha!... well... okay.

wow.
I am in.

i would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
why are you dressed like that?
well kiddo, i was there.
god!
jim has a very expressive face, do not you jim?
do not talk like that, stanley.
hey, carol.
just have a seat.
i would, could you just stand over here?
all right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today.
well, the other night, i was sitting at the table, eating my penis... i mean peas.
productivity is important but how can i be productive if i have this one little thing in my brain?
oh right.
well, okay.
what is going... what is going on?
i... i can not give you that, i-- i do not make this much.
that was offensive and lame.
i did not ask.
in addition to toby's urine being tested, i would like to test his blood and his hair.
do not make him excitable.
really phyllis?
yeah!
jim, this may be the last christmas that we have here, does not it make you a tiny bit anxious, me not playing santa?
mmhmm.
am i going to ask them to slit their wrists for me?
um... walking out of the room unexpectedly.
half pants, right mr. franklin?
can you believe it?
...  only on the rarest of occasions... ...would i go near-- toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.
post-it notes.
because that is gross misconduct and... just clean out your desk.
final answer!
oh, wow.
good, good, good.
you can be assistant to the team manager.
i would like to use the bailer.
heeeeeere's santa!
well what am i supposed to do?
perfect.
you ahh.
ok, see you later.
mmhmm.
mr. dwight schrute and i just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although i probably will never do it again, i had fun.
there is not going to be downsizing dwight, ok?
not.
what do you say we get our fris on before class?
the year before that, i came as monica lewinsky, and i wore a stained dress.
hey.
dwight!
hi.
chillin'.
oh, your face!
wild, and i have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well.
okay.
he gives me leads and i take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good.
pass.
would a liar bring mini mounds bars?
what do you - really?
yes you did.
what can i do you for?
she has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.
i can not relax in the same corner where i work.
that is what I am talking about!
kevin, where are you?
i was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
uh, oh, ok; if i step on a mine in scranton, pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?
you unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the... i am just saying that i do not think that you understand what i am saying.
well here we go.
no, i do not mind.
no, no, title change only.
they filled the balloon with pee.
we were going to go on the investors ski trip.
you know what?
I would come anywhere to see a turtle?
daddy's here for you.
she can not find those little colored paper clips that i like so much.
alright.
alright?
we start on a single blank sheet of paper.
hello, may i help you?
no, we can not.
I am mc mike scott, and i am hot.
gardner!

apres-vous.
ah!
hi, january  how are you?
it is very important to own property.
hey!
yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails.
that is... well... i got news for you, albert.
no question about it, i am ready to get hurt again.
so, unless i just go through with this, you are always going to look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
listen man, i am so sorry.
oscar, come on.
well-where is that bowl?
...we do not want them back, because they are... stupid.
double everything.
dunder mifflin, a great place to work!
and i just do not think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
take a sip of that.
well, okay... what is that smell?
that is a polaroid.
all right, just... smiles.
for kelly, that seems a bit much.
it is never whatever i want.
pro-am.
dwight, shh shh.
i had something very personal i would like to discuss.
that one says, "i am so lame." know which one i want?
god has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in new york tonight.
okay, the opposite of that?
here we go.
back.
it is still very cool.
if you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.
and he is a proctologist.
um, did you do the thing i asked you to do about the magazines?
absolutely but not really.
hey boo!
no, no.
in this way, i can truly be a hero.
no it is not.
um... yeah, well, if you leave we will only have two left.
really good.
keep working.
i know.
i bet, for you.
all right.
"meredith is so old..." "she is so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her." what is the difference between meredith and michael jackson?
oh, my god!
okay, sweetie, no.
no.
abso-fruit-ly.
well, that is good, he still has a sense of humor.
oh my god  oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey  wait, wait!
uh,  missterious.
thanks for your time.
okay, i have more of them.
and they had no yams?
or, uh, "super duper paper.
are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.
we did not actually plan that.
whoa whoa!
uh, yeah.
would you light it?
are people watching?
convoys are really fun.
first of all, you get to spend time with people you love.
what do you know about meredith?
you know what?
i got this so i can write down for thank-you notes.
325, 325.
when i was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... i got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and i had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and i never came outside.
i guess not.
and then it is like all regret.
you know what?
what does that even mean?
the two levels being, uh, "welcome to scranton"... and "i... love you." hey, what is the group that was from scranton that made it big?
who we got?
jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble.
you know what?
shh.
scream!
no.
have to think it through.
and nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
no, no no no... no, no.
it was beautiful.
oh, wow!
he was a good guy.
this is fine.
here we go.
this is all platonically, of course.
alright!
jim, take new year's away from stanley.
and i will never do that again.
i think they were stolen and they are gone forever.
oh, yeah right.
because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
this was no act of god.
heh.
i burned my foot on a george foreman grill.
you do not understand these people.
i mean, what, what specifically?
it is good to see you too!
you have nine days to save everybody's money.
it is very good.
well, yeah, yes.
so, most nights before i go to bed, i will lay six strips of bacon out on my george foreman grill.
i... do not see you.
ah, pet day.
not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.
me too.
the brochure is up here  and it is in here.
oh, there we go.
ah, okay.
eso es lo que dice, el!
what is up?
hey.
yeah.
wow, dwight, did you make cuts?
actually it is really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game.
if you break that girl's heart, i will kill you.
people are going to get sea sick watching this.
make the party.
come on!
my management style?
addition by addition.
only time will tell, my friends.
do sad.
oh shoot.
kevin?
i was a bad ass mo-fo.
this is the thing, i am a world class moron.
go to broadway shows, eat hot dogs.
what kind of car games did you play in the 'hood?
oh i love this song.
okay... alright.
and i really hate disappointing everyone.
one of the keys to success according to small businessman.
we could go there, sure.
move in here.
i like the way you think.
okay.
okay, um...  that is as clear as i can make it.
look, men are visual creatures.
well i hated it!
robert parrish!
good, cut?
okay.
you going to play it like this?
you are ruining it, already.
you know, i used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and i never caught anything that big.
i just thought you all should know that stanley hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend karen from utica is going to give him more money to work there.
but you just said 15. negotiation is an art.
iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches.
it is like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against aids, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
yes, the time has come to name my own replacement.
i think it went well.
I am writing one, yeah.
turn off the music.
oh, ok. masters of comedy.
alright!
but just know... if you ever lay a finger on phyllis, i will kill you.
you never met him.
um... oh, where is that?
drop what you are doing.
toby is the worst human being I have ever known.
that was a really sucky thing to do.
and there are not enough spaces on the lifeboat!
let us go.
how you doing?
react.
you got to keep yourself dehydrated.
do we save sales?
no, come on, dwight, i have to have 10 of these by lunch, i promised ryan.
actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam.
why are we going in the bathroom?
come on i need this.
look, i know that i screwed up in there.
i hope that you are willing to die in this office, because i am... hey toby, could i talk to you for a minute?
the fundamentals of business by michael scott.
we tell each other secrets.
i will allow that.
but did you see the way they looked at me?
that is like... a half an hour, every hour?
dun-der.
as a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
specifically, jan, i will make at least ten phone calls to clients.
here is the plan.
i think we are spoiled because we do not appreciate the things that we have.
never!
daryl.
no, toby.
i am.
would you please do me a solid and get darryl philbin on the speakerphone?
what was that printer we were looking at?
i forget, are you guys dating?
monthly dental appointment, soft teeth no, no.
is this the bus to mexico?
no, you know what is messed up?
good night vikram.
everybody takes the subway in new york.
because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
it was all the stuff that i said.
no one wants to pick me up!?
today's a special day, because i am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you... in business school, kevin.
well you thought wrong.
i will see you.
foliage.
oh, hey guys.
it will be a pleasure doing business with you.
where are you sitting?
no one.
which is you!
this looks delicious.
you know what?
oh, no, no, no.
are you?
oh, I am sorry, i thought you were , ok, i thought that was.
okay, look.
it is a miracle.
yes, sure they do, dwight.
johnny carson.
they are not easy.
they are going to call it mema.
and it is very painful.
we do not report it at all.
well, it is not ideal but you have to give me some credit because i made it into a word.
spice girls are opening for weird al.
yes, thank you.
anything that jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
give it to me.
i grab this , and i turn it on and i say, "prepare yourself, for the utica chain store massacre." no, do not worry, the chain is off.
are these numbers correct?
I am, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and i guess we are going to be neighbors.
son of a bitch.
there is the x-ax...icks.
ihop.
oh, oh, i see angela.
no, i promise i will not do it again.
i can not, no.
that is... that is.
i should not go in there.
you lose.
if not, what are all the churches for?
oh, i do not know.
I am in hell!
then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour.
and i would never take you for granted in a million years.
something happened!
get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
but, we have people with the biggest hearts.
here we are.
okay.
sounds good.
she would get this little foam mustache... and i used to say "hey, got latte?" and she would say, that is not funny.
no, sh- she did not.
i would not say that if i did not hundred percent believe it.
slavery versus the holocaust.
wow.
well we did talk about how handsome you are.
how about a group picture while you are here?
meryl streep is the bad guy.
who you dating?
stop it, please.
there she is.
can i use it?
michael scott paper company to see mr. david wallace.
hey, phyllis, do i need this invite to get in to the party?
you got to crack these things open.
I am trying to write something funny.
... people, ryan.
he does not love it that much.
bow bow bow!
i should have been lovers with her first and then friends.
here we go.
I will take a little look-see.
that is great.
hey, pam, pam- with this raise there are strings attached.
one for the road, gentlemen?
long story.
good for you.
i mean who are we, the girl scouts?
okay, part of the problem was that toby talked at you.
well i hope i make it.
let us keep it rolling.
i do ping.
okay, who said that?
you shaved?
what the hell is that?
how many plates are we getting?
just so you know, he is at his funniest when you have given him five shots.
you think this kid could be a fighter pilot?
ah, me so horny.
blacks do crack!
what about a raise based on merit?
you know what?
let us do your performance review- ah, why, that is great news?
and there is stanley.
mr. brown, if that was his real name.
so they may be looking for a little change in the cfo.
called my man, dwight, just to see what was shakin'.
the most sacred thing i do is care and provide for my workers, my family.
and that one little thing is a soft pretzel.
why are you so negative?
I am sorry.
admit it.
well, now suddenly he can see.
i gave up the only job i ever loved to do this?
you never touched my propecea, or my accutane, did you?
if you will have me, yes.
what is taking someone from behind?
you know who wished they could get back to work is ed truck.
not one of our harder workers.
alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.
we are the goateeless brothers.
well... no.
we will do it quickly.
you should grow candy.
railroads, and sales.
oh that feels better.
people who own houses and people who own condos.
yeah.
ok, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right?
i do not know if i want to do this.
no.
thoroughness is very important in an office and... yeah, yeah, of course.
he said, where is the bomb?
and we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place.
ok, good.
well, yeah, it is a promise.
clearly, i have had a very serious accident, but i will recover, god willing.
ohh, no, no, no!
some companies still know how business is done."  okay?
can you believe he would never heard that before he worked here?
yes.
that is just an arbitrary title.
now i have got their attention.
she, she looked a lot like tina fey.
well, they need our money.
okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
"michael scott paper company." okay.
is not it wonderful?
I am going to date them one year apart.
so please hand this letter of congratulations to dwight k. schrute.
i saved 3 years salary.
what do you know about management, dwight?
okay, alright.
or, should i say, the banquet hall.
is that all?
i am a bank teller.
it is certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so... ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time.
well i think we dodged a bullet there.
cafe disco.
yes, but, ben franklin was.
...jim.
i will meet with him, but I am not going alone.
i do not really get it because we are not doing that bad and our numbers are going to come up.
mmm.
because that is all it takes.
it- it- i already have my european girlfriend.
were there any connections between any of us?
andy bernard.
yeah, i will.
give it.
jim, jim, do not, do not... no, i can do it.
let us keep it moving!
now stanley is a dundie all-star, are not you stan?
but most importantly we need to get her some medical attention.
i present to you the kama sutra.
so, i, uh... well thanks for coming over, i appreciate - jan, you... complete... me.
what happened?
okay, dwight.
great.
why do not you enliven me?
I am thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we will go month to month after that.
it is not over.
this is going to be good.
oh god!
ya'll come back now.
wow.
we will still get to use the little cups, though, right?
it is the closest that the irish will ever get to christmas.
hello.
you know?
if you want to dump me, i totally get it.
oh... yes.
i... was just learning... to... love.
everybody, i have some good news, and i have some bad news.
why would you even ask me to - i, i mean, not that it matters, because i do not, but wha - ok, all right, fine.
let it go.
sex.
huh, math, that is not so hard.
nope.
look at this.
six-million dollar man!
it is none of your business.
dwight and i were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
just have a thought.
this was so stupid.
four.
hmmm... ok, well, it is after five.
absolutely!
what is the matter... haaaww!
it is, uh,  excuse me.
she was engaged to an animal.
all right.
that is just the first thing... came... in head.
like in a dorm room.
I will be down in just a second.
so i am going to hear her out.
let us get serious here.
best lunch ever!
take the rest of the afternoon off.
I will talk to you...  this is going to be hard for me to speak today.
no!
no you ahh.
me had an i-rey time.
shhh, I am just trying to figure out what is going on in that room, okay?
so say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers.
fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
mhhmm!
i am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.
how are you?
i want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
you do not know that.
oh, helene, hi.
i tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and i failed.
because people out there are expecting it.
you should!
carol and i split up.
what do you do?
let us all clap at phyllis.
I am just driving by, thought I would drop in.
look at that.
yeah... did you see that!
hey, you know who you should be jealous of?
which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis.
no, no.
alright who is next?
and i bought this condo to fill with children.
andy.
mmmhmm.
ok, alright.
i want you to know that you are beautiful.
i just have some questions that i was going to ask.

car starting.
not offensive.
ok, phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.
so.
stop and shop.
absolutely not.
who here is a history buff?
hello, hello!
yeah.
fine.
look at him!
i have not gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.

unless he fails, and we have talked about that already.
thank you.
so why do not i take you on a tour of past dundie winners.
wish me luck.
this is all we need.
oscar works in... here.

bye-bye.
okay.

yes, i did.
I am calling-  I am sorry.
I am just getting hardcore with him.
people work faster after... no... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.

uh huh, kenneth road, born and raised.
I will catch you on the flippity flip.
we are so rich.
not bad, not bad at all.
i mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
so i do not think i need to wait out dunder mifflin.
sometimes you will think something and i will say what you are thinking- umm, nacho chips.
thank you.
okay.
um... i think i can do it.
oh...my god!
hey, pam, what is up?
calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike.
two fifteenths.
he actually works in the indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.
as your leader and your friend, i sort of demand that you can all speak in public as i can... and did... twice.
you know what, we do not have to deal with this.
been watching the wire recently.
the trip sucked, david.
and you are engaged and I am sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so let us just clear out okay.
no.
exactly.
that was helping.
oh, you are kidding me.
he is a- yeah, he is alright.
if you had any friends, you would understand.
not with michael scarn, fbi.
because you think he is black.
mm hmm.
it does not matter what i spent.
i did that in the car on the way home.
you think that is funny.
that is, that is true.
yeah, actually, perfect.
happy holidays.
where is your costume?
um... yes, in a way.
quality assurance.
let us also give a shout-out to phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
no, i think they are talking about me.
guys, guys, guys.
so we will wait for our family members.
you know, not what this is about.
really?
this is what i get.

and good for them.
yeah, i do.
and dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.
that is silly.
hey, can i play?
what is our excuse?
you know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so i think, i think my odds are pretty good.
dwight.
alright.
come here please.
we have the professor and ginger, welcome aboard.
here she comes.
I am going to have to cut this all out.
yeah.
no.
mo' money, mo' problems.
i wrote down a list of bullet points why holly and i should be together, and I am going to find the perfect moment today and i am going to tell her.
so... did not you think 'lazy scranton' was funny?
yeah!
what?
I am texting about you, okay!?
okay?
pam has been with us for...  forever.
you know what?
well, thank you, andy.
too much for me to have by myself.
jim jim jim... we are having a company meeting here.
you guys just are workin' for the weekend, are not you?
pam, come on.
abso... you know what?
i booed someone tonight.
and gabe looks like lady gaga.
i want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.
unbelievable.
would you like some googi googi?
angela I would like you to come into my office in ten minutes.
"michael, what are you thinking?
that is what i want you to write down in yours.
hmm?
here is what we are going to do.
blegh.
oh, that looks good.
no, we can not.
i think that was ... i was probed.
all right, ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you?
she is an alternate.
making the time.
I am out of here slaves.
bringing home the bacon.
i do not deserve this, guys.
that is stupid.
put your lips on my lips.
okay, honestly, it was unlikely i was going to figure this out anyways.
always the bridesmaids, right ladies?
what am i going to do with a removed uterus?
love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of january just call me levinson in the morning, baby.
do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it is own sake.
great performance, very, very solid all the way around.
there is no telling what i might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
ready?
and i think we should celebrate oscar's mexicanity.
good, I am glad we are on the same page.
that is great.
pam, let us go.
the joke's on you goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.
everybody looks so jolly.
look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.
jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
now you know how i feel.
no, i did not intentionally get you drunk.
right.
she was a receptionist.
she said she was going to give it to him right now.
i was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
because we are no longer lovers, and she is just hurting.
thank god.
and our, all of ours joys.
well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal- well, i... it could be either of us.
its says here that it is a 300ft drop.
they are good sure.
jim and pam!
i want you to enjoy your cake before i tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
come on.
i will bring it on.
what he is doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs." i am ridiculously anti-drug.
yes.
all right.
see ya.
so hang in there, and i will see you at the end of the day.
why is today a special day?
hey linda, can i get a picture of you?
i... you know what?
really?
you can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
he is a fan of the outrageous.
yes, i am sure, jim.
I am caleb crawdad, i do declare.
you are a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he is better than everyone else, because he is some hot shot, and you do not know anything about sales.
yeah.
that is crazy!
um, i do not know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
no.
please grab a pen, because i will only be repeating this once.
or uh?
yes, she did.
please respect the lei.
which rhymed.
okay, see you in a bit.
if you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
sort of a "where is waldo." alright.
somebody in this office.
whoa, look at those vivid colors.
the big round things.
why would a dog do that?
i like you.
that will show  them.
i really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions.
do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
well... you... you... you are as creepy as a real serial killer.
you explain to me how that was fair, and I will explain to you how this is fair.
so all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
I am hungry.
eat it.
i understand that, dwight.
it is michael.
no, there were a lot of people booing you.
you know what, i feel like one of those old timey sailors.
so what, you are having a little spat.
there was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my tv.
how much do you charge?
can anybody guess who that is?
i love that!
see all these?
ryan is probably, like, a two.
do not look at him.
i just say it.
all right first name is tom- all right, okay, okay, you are getting inside my head.
okay.
what we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here.
should have peed before i left.
and, i am very... ... proud.
alright, I am going to be in my office if anybody needs me.
i need her name if I am going to return her glove.
it is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
pam.
it is just, i... i think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
you are all jerks.
happy?
is that dishonest?
okay... that is... that is the whole point, dummy.
that is very gracious of you.
look,  it is a pimple phyllis.
I am sorry.
that is me.
that is incredible!
that will not go over well.
i should leave.
please, thank you.
what are you doing?
this is a starbucks digital barista.
and that can not happen.
so how are things going with andy?
this is not some sort of construction site...or all of italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat.
what?
oh, actually, while i have you, not that i have you or have ever had you, but we are having our casino night tonight and i think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
ohh, i miss you.
never see it coming.
you do?
find out whose car that is.
hoo-hah.
yes i do.
should have had hindsight.
no gabe is... gabe is not the boss.
he is temping upstairs.
well, what should i do?
the electric city.
then it is no longer a mistake... gabe.
there were, like, 200, 300 people before.
sorry, oh wow, that is so rude.
i was thinking pammy but boys night out is also good.
other people's... something.
yeah!
of course, of course.
welcome, welcome, welcome!
i love the people here.
i could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay.
it is a defective ax, my friend.
well- it is- that is different.
knock, knock.
okay, good, a pact.
i do too.
are you crying?
nope, nope, i do not think anybody wants to see that.
god.
bye.
on one hand i want to be honest with jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I am afraid she is going to dump me.
no, no.
you have to close.
i went through holly's things.
that is not true.
here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
come on in.
i can not say.
all right.
well you know what, where is my golden shower, phyllis?
jan thinks hunter is very talented.
these are our demands.
this is the "amazing race."  and you guys are the retired marines.
all right.
barack is president!
well, then, why are not you bugging me to fire everybody who is bad?
and martin has had a bad influence, to think that i gave him the benefit of the doubt.
i think they would look better right here.
the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit.
busted.
we are all on the same team here, the dunder mifflin team.
then you are all punished.
no more brain damage!
okay, yes, sure, i will do that... ...because I am the first to to find out.
exactly!
you know where we are going to go?
i am well, sir, how are you?
you know, as you do at weddings.
it does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.
boom.
oh!
now i want everybody to take a look to their right.
no, well can you get on that, because i do not just read cracked.
four!
thank you.
what are we supposed to do?
wanted to get him oh the places you will go, but they were sold out.
if i am fired, i swear to god, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the f-word on it.
you know what would have happened?
what a douche bag!
you know what?
was john belushi fine?
yeah, you love him right?
i love you, meredith.
that is ridiculous.
not funny.
i am going nowhere.
it was amazing.
hey... mint chocolate chip, please?
you know what, i resent the implication that i would keep that secret.
is it like, uh... do you have laser tag down there or something?
attention everyone.
is somebody there?
start, like, right in there.
i hate you!
where is michael?
stop it now, god.
I am in the brig.
today at lunchtime we are going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball.
then you take these and clip them wherever.
the coach!
everybody?
because, if i do not have this, what do i have?
and i was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride.
is that what you are saying?
do you want me to?
nobody cares about your stupid beet farm.
actually, today's a good day to do that.
i want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the dunder mifflin warehouse inventory.
there is a lot of princesses out there.
I am unhappy when I am with her.
13 hot dogs, everybody!
mmm.
probably make  them feel like wimps.
it is not a limo.
wooo-yaaaaah!
oh, god, I am so sick of chuck e. cheese.
oh.
let us do this.
everything is wrong, dwight.
you know what, dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
so... no.
i say we just smash all the computers.
oh.
it is 8:30. and it is st. patrick's day, which is a world ethnic holiday.
great.
tony!
what is this?
i try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.
nobody needs your help.
i do not.
they got pierce morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, larry lives on.
just, uh, she did not want it to continue for some reason.
good work pam.
good morning.
it also explains why the name on his mailbox was m shulman.
do you want to do that?
this whole delivery slash sales idea?
raise your cups on high.
although i may have to break it tonight when helene and i tell pam over dinner.
wow.
these are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
i was going to call you in anyway.
i will have to answer.
ok, i see some people who like to buy things.
hottest in the office goes to,  danny cordray!
carol.
god!
but you know what is invaluable is intuition.
really?
ready?
just... why?
i am so used to fighting corporate that i forget that i am corporate.
mi-chael!
welcome back!
hey jim-bag.
what did they say?
i said it on the second date.
they use cocaine.
clean up on aisle five.
he would not give me a good discount.
because a lot of people think that models, even though they are very attractive, are somewhat vapid.
no, it is not weird, andy, and you know what else?
no!
lowest of the low.
uh huh... big... all right!
look at that!
"do not..." okay, that is blank.
4-9-1-7-4-5-1 they would never know it was me doing it.
good luck.
they do not even-  gah!
we are going to... come here .
was there any emotion going on?
okay, jim?
okay.
tied to my desk.
you look great too.
here we go.
you me?
it is a little bit bigger than i remember.
this is where the magic happens.
they are all over the place.
you never yell at the client.
.
i have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
it is still wet.
welcome, welcome.
yes.
stanley, you may go.
powerpoint!
your choice.
it is a letter of recommendation.
it is a rental.
it is true.
yes.
oh, good.
but you know what?
watch out, pam.
ok, do not get that.
i am going to be sick... I am going to puke.
you are welcome.
she was cute.
good work.
why hello everybody!
think these guys are nice?
oh my nose so itchy, why is my nose so itchy!
we will keep an eye on america for you.
are you still taking the antidepressants?
so, dwight, you uh, have the east german gal.
right here!
ok.  that is not appropriate.
who is dr. perry?
hey.
just say the word.
no, no, no, no.
pam beesley ladies and gentleman.
all right, are we ready?
could you tell her,  "brbrbrbrbr!" also?
everyone.
what are you going to do?
that was great, she gets it!
we have a lot of angry customers out there.
keep on point.
not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
I am scared, too.
I am joking.
and, um, some singles, if you will!
okay.
but freaky, man, you know.
ooh.
just kidding, not yet anyway.
you me?
why do not you take two?
oh, my god.
my mom, pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on I am, what is her face from quiznos, i see her four times a week.
i can not tell you.
i should be mad at you guys.
bom bom bom-bom bom.
they are good, huh?
jim?
hup!
i will open the door.
well, this is a work related matter.
oh...never mind.
and as for today, just a typical day.
ah, angelo.
well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are going to share the same menstrual cycle.
ladies and gentlemen, mr. david wallace!
great work.
i have no shortage of company names.
i do not know if i can trust you anymore.
so it is a matter of interest.
yeah, what?
ho, hol, hold on big guy, I am going to put it in the mail sunday night and you will get it weds.
by an alien life form.
look me in the eye.
he goes up to people with a camera and he is like "why did you do this?
very good, nice.
shut up, dwight.
wow!
what?
other than the fact that he dated angela, i do not think he is a snappy dresser.
no way.
dwight, you are going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult.
no, just look.
oh, oh, oh.
buddy?
well, sure, playing the field is great, do not get me wrong, but there is more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
you know, a little morale boost.
well, maybe those will help.
uh, pam, will you get angela and meet us in the conference room please?
you only have me for a limited time... yes.
i um, i spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, i guess they all flew west for the winter, and i, i just had some thoughts that i wanted to share with you people.
i should have spotted another addict.
well... i did not know they did not know.
you are hired!
but i have to go the bathroom real quick.
yes?
yes, yes.
let us go!
sort of a kapoor's list.
so, mum's the word.
this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts.
that is insultingly low.
and you know what?
you know who else did not go to business school?
she smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
i am declaring a moment of silence right now.
click on guest list.
because it was a good idea.
ladies and gentlemen, may i present to you for the first time as a couple, mr. and mrs. bob vance!
okay, sounds great.
so, get excited.
"i need to see this play like i need a hole in the head."  and i hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious aids joke.
alcoholic.
and... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?
you know what we should do?
okay?
wow!
yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah.
you are actually talking a lot.
if you want a truce, i will give you a truce.
oh no, no, no.
it is off limits.
and yeah, you know what?
blech.
this is considered to be polite.
we are going to take care of you.
really?
there just were not enough clients for the two of you.
why is my office black?
herpes duplex.
everybody's right.
my last dundies ever.
you look at her... and she is kind of matronly today, but back in high school, i swear, her nickname was 'easy rider'.
it is just... you are right.
okay, you can... fast forward.
ugh...  I am in.</i> oh yeah!
right here.
no, it is more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.
so these are pizza dogs, they are not pigs in a blanket per se.
we should celebrate.
ok... no, no, no, no, this is good.
do you need some music, or...?
good.
my head is in such pain!
just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules.
it is very funny and charming and heartwarming.
we will wait.
shh.
side of candied pams.
um.
i am incommunicado, capisce?
remember how you felt when you thought you would seen roger clemens?
like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.
i do not know what he is doing.
happy birthday to you.
jim.
all right.
thank you.
it is stupid.
go get yourself a monkey kidney." yes.
you mean cancer?
here we go!
i know.
it is so good.
he might do it... i dare you to.
give him to me.
oh god, rabies?
keep simulating.
i would like to have all the racists brought together and take darryl philbin out to lunch.
whoa whoa whoa!
okay.
and yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me.
the next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift.
they are like the golden globes but less mean.
no.
brain hurricane.
so how is that uh, coffee from earlier?
pow!
no, no.
check that out.
just do your best!
both of them.
wow!
huh, ok. now you and i have a conflict.
karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?
thank you, spoiler alert.
and you guys are okay with this?
that was really good.
here is a box, for your things, but i doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.
you saw the movie, those of you who did.
and they are expecting excellence because i did do such a good job.
it is two p.m. from now until four, your priority is knitting.
he is throwing it.
yes.
yes!
that could be you  if you had not forgotten french.
yes.
ow, ow, aahch!
in the islands, they do not make you do stuff like take inventory.
here is toby from human resources.
dwight, you got to move!
ok, ready?
I am scared I am going to love it.
i can not believe i get to be with you.
it is a big day for phyllis.
why are you telling me this?
come on in.
three, two, one.
anything goes.
no, no, no, no.
i wish every day was diversity day.
see this sign?
and... I am... pretty nervous about it.
no, of course  you can not go.
whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... and i was a peasant.
it was clerical.
hello, traitor.
follow my finger.
i should talk to her.
yeah!
so, uh, so what is the vibe?
yes.
oh my god!
yeah, have a seat.
uh, who else?
darryl, i did not walk out in the middle of yours.
that is not appropriate.
place looks great with all the lights on.
is it an idea?
hey!
i am?
$2 billion dollar a year industry.
all right.
you are welcome, baby.
um... and then like twelve other kids came forward.
sure.
aw, so good to be home.
and you know how all waitresses look alike.
dwight.
good.
walk with me.
do you need  them?
i do not want to know.
ok, it stopped.
james bond fire.
well, that is because you and i have very different tastes and you like lame things.
ok. why do not we just defer to mr... ah.
yeah, take as many as you want.
friends do not need to apologize to friends as far as I am concerned, so we are cool.
ok, so I am the guy at the station.
oh, okay.
can not you understand that?
they come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we are all gone, they jack up the prices.
it is like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away.
we start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes.
do good.
okay.
I am taking all the credit." okay, well, that is because he is paying their salary.
is that jim's?
oh, pam, i forgot to get you something.
um... who do you think you are?
so, basically, i am co-giving away the bride.
no.
so what i was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud?
it takes an advanced sense of humor.
nice!
hmm... that is a tough decision.
that... is for a good because.
all right, get out.
all right, let us go.
mmmhmmm.
so she is passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog... and the neighbors blamed january it is like, you know, the dog should not have been outside in the first place.
hey!
all right!
that would really, really have shown him up, would not it?
do not freak out.
it is diversity day, jim.
i loved them all.
please let go.
they think the whole place revolves around them.
thank you so much.
you are cooped up in there all day.
you are glad?
i am going to donate to afghanistanis with aids.
hi.
i watch the l word.
tell me dana, how is your chicken breast?
jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.
no, pam.
dancing babies!
...and products!
you found out?
</p> oh, john belushi.
that is not even my handwriting.
looks like you are going to a fish fry, dwight.
just unwarranted.
it is ah... god, these people are so... these are good people.
mm.
that could have gone one of two ways, but i never expected her to get upset.
you better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
i think you are wrong.
whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.
hello, dwight, I have been expecting your call.
why do not you explain this to me like i am an eight-year old.
he should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
yes.
and sometimes i can hardly handle that!
it is just coffee, guys!
I am still here.
well, actually, it is my warehouse.
yes!
wait, ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
set?
no, no, oh, my god!
they use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common.
i was ahead of the car.
look who you are talking to.
okay, it happening.
really?
i think i could back out of the sale.
i was asleep.
I am going to take a little breather for a second.
and the strangest thing happened.
it is grrrrrrape!
all right.
yep.
no.
that would be great  just a little something to remember the trip by.
that cool?
oh, hooters to go.
i know you are going to like this.
scooch.
great.
let us go.
yeah.
i want you to make the decision so I am not the bad guy.
and the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
the baby multiplies the fun.
it was insensitive and i am sorry.
dwight, you saw darryl move it, right?
the suggestion box that i put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?
i love you, angela.
i did not hire an ex-convict.
may he rest in peace.
well, I am writing a message.
why do you hate her?
you will not drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
is there a god?
six seconds, macgruber!
okay.
no.
mr. schofield's ready to see me.
did you?
oh... that is great!
huh?
can not wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.
also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
hey, have her come out!
really?
that is why you made... you kind of have.
well, he... well, maybe i did.
you have tv in the joint?
does holly feel that way?
i have a conflict with that.
he is my... ok. may i please just use your phone?
this is justin.
hi, guys.
it is a woman thing.
i going to stay up all day.
when somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.
why would we do that?
try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
shake hands, get over it.
to have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'wow.
you think stanleys grow on trees?
sure.
really?
we are all friends.
what happened?
i think we... go together so well.
not if the printer is not hooked up.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
that sounds good too.
and i always will.
foul!
all right, guys, come on, let us bring it in!
packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
my god, what have they been teaching you?
you are the silent killer.
that.
pam?
yes, it is.
okay, wow.
you are trying to trick me.
i have a laundry machine!
so I will know where-- I am asking pam to do it, please.
where is my girl?
thank you.
it is about the workplace.
this bird is dead.
that is not a baby.
boss just been ridin' my ass.
what was... if he had just waited and heard what i had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
alright?
uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme... yeah, i do not even know why i said booze cruise.
because i can grab that no problem.

i love jello pudding pops.
that is not going to happen.
but i was going to.
okay, um, alright.
but i feel pretty good right now.
so it is kind of our coming out party.
it was a trick question.
mm-hmm.
no, i can not drive.

your company is losing clients left and right.
I am pretty good on politics.
that means conference room, five minutes!
i do not want to get into this debate again.
you love him.
airplane.
help me out here.
you really hid it well.
we both reserve the right to go to jo if we disagree with gabe.
why did i say that?
oh this... call waiting.
i do not think she is going to make it.
seven deadly sins.
give me a hard one.
anybody have any ideas of what we could do.
i just love sales.
but there was another michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday.
no, no, no.
that is not the point.
that- hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
I am out.
no!
okay.
so... who do you think it should be?
good job.
forrest gump: mentally challenged, philadelphia : aids.
the thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
alright, well- I will work on that- let us keep going.
not the guy who was trying to be creative.
yeah- i think everyone has meet helene.
I am not going to leave until you forgive me.
yeah.
now, why would jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period?
you are next!
ok, feel better.
might as well be dinner.
oh boy.
one.
yep.
really?
this is where the magic happens!
no, no, we are going to have three closets, one for each base, no homers.
her words, not mine.
listen stanley.
i hate disappointing just one person.
hey jo.
oh, no.
good luck to you.
yes, it is true.
yeah yeah.
he is on the phone.
and it is part of my job, but... blah!
i want you to think about it long and hard.
i should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies - that is my wife you are talking about, man.
so anti-drug that i am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
packer!
okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right?
i know.
okay, oh!
sorry phyllis.
it is?
... how much?
pam, defcon ten.
oh!
been there, done that.
and now, i realize that you can program or download any ring you want.
go!
those are the facts.
we are doing i.d.
i think you go camping by yourself-- in the wilderness.
through these blinds is where i first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and i thought you were the prettiest mover i had ever seen.
over the last few weeks, things have been changing here.
she is not the only one that is going to be eating it, right?
it is more of a david-and-goliath thing.
yeah.
pam, karen, even phyllis.
i had a few more dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I am just going to cut it short.
I am glad we are finally on the same page.
this chat.
erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
you try to help everybody.
nudity required.
you know me very well, dwight.
i was scooperman, you were scoopy-doo.
yesterday i was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and i gave myself the nastiest shock.
that is why everybody... well, it is part of it, it is just the... uhhh.
I am pretty busy, i should just... oh.
that is what she said!
nope.
yeah?
oh, this guy in my neighborhood, tom dizemore.
oh!
you know what?
how many of you are salesmen?
well, please?
and i think i have come up with the reason why.
what?
or at least business associates -"  chinese?
come on in.
a black man?
ok. fine.
oh, shoot!
try my... all right!
it is about how you feel about the dundies.
you look great.
too much information?
there could be others...  i need to know.
we have been friends forever, right?
okay, okay.
dwight!
it could be an old person.
so, thank you very much.
hey guys.
ok, here is what happened, david.
i can test anyone randomly, and i have chosen you randomly.
probably been a lot funnier.
and here is pam.
it was official business, so just... yeah, paper business.
okay, everybody out.
i need help right now.
yeah, right here.
there he is.
how 'bout a toast.
oh, and hunter?
okay, well, i really think that... yeah.
you know what?
i just do not - i do not know.
messages, please.
do what?
conceptual!
good worker, though.
and their jaws just dropped to the floor.
we are going to go in here.
ok!
the waving?
pulled off an amazing '80s party last year.
let us get vanilla.
you can not pass.
...andy?
today i got up, i stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that is it.
game over.
singles only.
i should punch him in the nose for what he is making me do to her.
that would look terrible.
ok, purple belt, ok. i got him.
ok.  well done.
because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids do not respect the father who does not respect the boss.
because you do not call them collared people, that is offensive.
okay.
what a nice guy.
hoo-ooh!
right.
kevin, we are a family here and phyllis is a valued member of that family.
my bad.
ok?
there is been a murder in savannah.
did you sneeze it off?
this is a business question.
hello, oh god, busy work.
tmi.
okay, are you sure?
wow, really?
all right.
all this arguing reminds me of a very funny story.
okay, show of hands.
god!
slim jim.
uh, two seconds macgruber!
how did we do it?
steak!
remarkable.
ah, you are quite the gentleman.
I am not paying for the label.
it bothers me that you are not answering the question.
have an original thought.
and before that, i was of.j.
how are you holding up?
we need some couches in here.
thank you.
umm, hmmm.
oscar, why do not you come over here.
you may be asking yourself, "what am i doing on a trampoline?"  well, i thought I would bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.
does she do that all the time?
you can count on me.
umm... ok... ahh... alright, no more desks.
come on, guys.
hey, what are you guys doing in here?
and, I will be honest, i have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
why is this little 2 so small?
that is what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful christmas with no drama.
What are you got, What are you got?
nope, nope, nope.
over here, over here.
what do you say?
okay, everybody, listen up.
probably a smoker, so...  so that is the way it is done.
let us get up.
hey, dwight.
powerpoint!
if we ask corporate for that then... could go either way.
that was  us, right there.
what part of "i need to pee" do you not understand?
just stop it.
that is ironic.
and given our history, i need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
it is not been a blockbuster year for me financially.
life is short.
all right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and i will let you know when it is time to film.
stretch it.
just let go.
that is what i do, steal my trick.
but i do not have money problems, i do not.
call a client right now.
what is in here?
we have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
and expresso.
my golden ticket idea?
oh ho ho, yea!
if i ever start acting like that weenie gabe i want you to take that gun, and i want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I am dead.
you can... okay, i think we are good.
do not say that.
me chief michael scott.
guess what, i have flaws.
show time!
um... and i want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead.
i did not can i have a ride home?
oh, I am glad it timed out that way.
ooh, okay.
oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?
and we all got misled.
when phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute.
so, i think you could all just take off now.
i know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I am not here.
goodbye my friend.
oh man.
it is the easy way out.
okay, rhymes with parnold schporzenegger.
yeah!
ah, i know, everything really.
inventory is boring.
ok, i am really going to do this.
who is michael?
who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?
okay.
yeah.
you will find something else and... awesome.
that was a different guy.
cut out the middle man.
whoa!
um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
well, i guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and pam and ryan.
I am going to wait.
she is- okay.
that is- you did not- you were not hurt by that.
when a cat gets stuck in a washing machine.
no, no!
if you do not, that is fine.
that is what men say to each other, after a fight.
do good.
phyllis.
hey, you.

we have three scenes to film, big scenes.
maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
she is going to freak out!

dwight, come on... there is no downsizing.
best friends.
congratulations, bob.
oh.
no.
I am fine.
all day.
how long do we have to wait?
pam.
right?
yes.
no.
well, everybody, you remember holly.
oh, christ.
yes, she was.
and now dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
erin?
in fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met harriet and now she thinks she is better than everybody.
wish me luck!
hey, check this out.
oh my god!
well, I will be in my office.
no.
okay!

i could not do that, jim.
anybody making out in here?
yes i am.
yeah, I am glad you called.
... no, he did not!
i thought it might make me feel better.
thank you.
you do not have all the facts.
can not allow it.
what is going on?
if your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
have you seen that video?
it made me laugh when i heard it, but pam got really offended.
unless you like it.
see what i did?
take it back.
all right.
okay, well, that is just ridiculous, so just do not, i-i do not have time for this right now.

no... no, this is just a stupid formality.
you know, i made out with january.. yeah?
i will seduce her.
e.t.

but i thought that you were exactly awesome.
you nervous about seeing karen again, since she was the other woman?

bad boy.
they say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office.
please stop it, stop it.
dot com!
well, he, michael scarn, that character, orders people around, and that is, you should of just gone- well... i do not think there is any stronger choice than being a really strong character.
right.
no, no... run what?
and I am treating ryan the same way.
michael scott here.
okay.
you did.

corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me.

i am not going to tell you anything.
ryan... has never made a sale.

what?
okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
um... well, you guys, you know, I am the boss so... hey, hey... you guys believed me?

unless everybody can agree on something better?
i think i faked stanley out too.
i thought... i was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.

just stand right up.
i am so happy right now.
i told dwight that there is honor in losing.
angela kevin, you have to help me out i just need a few things then i will be gone.
i accidentally cross-dressed.
okay, hold on.
um... nope, nope.
you have only seen it flat.
you listen to me.
i call dibs.
we all have problems.
i have been calling people "faggie" since i was in junior high, and i have never made this mistake.

does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
I will start.
cool.
excuse me?!
excuse me, everyone... sex!

because an office can not function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
my girlfriend carol is coming to our party tonight, and i have a little surprise for her.

you are wrong.
solid fellow.
i can not believe you are not going to be there.
your loss.
um... well, that is probably going to happen, actually.
okay meredith, let us give it a shot.
okay.
we just punish her.
i would kill bin laden and then toby.
you do not have enough water in there?
do not be a caricature kevin, never be a caricature.
do we speak english?
and, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 grand .
oh, i wish i was a bridesmaid.
whatever you call it, i am running away from my responsibilities.
seriously.
ok, ryan.
just go out, and come back in.
okay, okay,  stand up.
or ryan.
you guys are young, that is great.

yes.
we did?
it is ju- they did not have any more businessmen.

my last physical when i was forty.
well, maybe i could stop by.
aaaahh!
she does not hold a candle to you, erin.
happy birthday, belatedly.
kelly and i are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out.
i got it.
gabe seems tall.

do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
you know?
we-yeah, they are very-they are different.
do you ever miss us?
no!
but ed truck can not because he is-- dead.
ah.

just talking about you.
kind of fun, inside.
pam.
well, you came on the day of our christmas party.
well?
is there anything i can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for dr. shaundry?

who to pick?
children cannot lie.
yes, we have the... all right.
i think you are, yes, why do not you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.
all those sucker branches can suck our fat!
you shove it.
she is dj jazzy flax, and she is the best.
because i am collar-blind.
how strange.

i go over other people's heads.
no you did not.
i would not... steal the bread.
I am michael scott.
we have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.
okay.
yes, it was.
people's legs are crushed under rubble.
you are out of here!
my ideals at a party?
good luck.
thank you.
look, look.
wow, okay.
so have a great long weekend.

no.
oh, wow!
ow!

okay, i believe you, i believe you.
no, no.
hey!
no, it is not good enough.
but if something else came up, i would definitely not go.
oh-oh.
magic magic magic magic magic magic... and now, michael the magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.
holly, i did not mean to do it.
correct.
hey.
so um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do?
no.
if oscar wants a donkey, let us get him one.
he knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and i am going to call in a little favor.
I am like forrest gump, except i am not an idiot.
do you know who i am?
i do not have to tell you anything.
fair enough.
well this is going to hurt like a mother.
michael scott.
i insist.
and... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
so it is not true.
so you want to?
wow us.
jim?
we are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
no, we are just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
how contagious is that, is that like an std?
oh my god.
stay, stay.
we have a relationship.
and you sent that out to everyone?
are you going to kill me?
what?
um, let us just do this in 15 minutes.
that is not what happened.
give and take.
what?
i know, i know.
on.
really pam, is that what you think of me?
hey.
look at that!
gotcha.
okay.
we are going to hide.
well, this... yeah?

that is annoyed.
ok, now going by seniority.
no.

ah, well, good.
okay.
it is really happening.
not bad, huh?
ok. well, check this out.

all of these jobs?
sometimes you really creep me out.
you meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that is how you do the scarn!
well guys, I would love to go to bernie's with you, but, you know, i have an office party.
thank you very much, sir.
so keep it going.
we were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did i stutter," and i said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" it was joking, toby, alright?
get on up here.
you can use it.
good one... well... pow pow pow... no!
you lost two hundred pounds, and i lose my car keys every morning.

occasionally he will need a little push, and i will do that, and he will slow down, and I will push him again.
come on, you know, that is not.
damnit, phyllis!
why?
the only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and i am not robbing the cradle.
thank you.
i thought i was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on!
would have been nice to work with my family.
okay, you know what?
thank you.
saved it.
david, here it is.
under this tree, i think i struck the mother load.
look, we will tell her that it is bad, but it could have been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work i was able to cut it in half.
okay geniuses, how would you do it?
her name was pam.
this smells of fraud to me.
the real thing is that stanley hudson had an affair.
we are going to listen in on darryl's presentation to the warehouse.
i gassed up the car... actually, i put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
well, let us see, i made pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck.
a dream team.
ok everybody, I have figured it out.
yes, you did.
we are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.
see?
these guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work.
this is delightful, charming culture.
look, i have a whole program planned.
congratulations.
i sent it back.
okay.
here we go.
no, i will seduce her.
I am very fast!
welcome.
cool, cool, cool.
i love you.
i got in the way.
but you said you liked it.
you did!
look at me.
i chose massive coronary, because you told me that your dad had a bad heart.
let us - come on.
first, go to wendy's, get my food.
well, he is based on the chinese delivery guy that i have, who talks exactly like that, so, i think you should take it up with him instead of me.
ask them about the toys on my desk too.
oh, my god.
and once in awhile one of the amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.
no way.
come out here since it is a secret, and I will tell you.
okay.
no.
hold on, hold on darryl.
all cleaned?
well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down.
a check for the kids, and for the team.
my own personal dvd player and 20 movies.
oh my god, something is happening.
ah, katy.
i had to make a snap decision dwight.
oh, that hurts.
we will find you a joke that not even you can ruin.
pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
hi holly it is michael, i just wanted to call and let you know that i was thinking about what you said.
okay, right there is the problem.
no.
nothing disturbing here.
i do not understand.
yeah sales, you sell pizza.

money has been a little tight lately.
I am going to do traffic... detail.
justin polznik!
<i>what</i> is your problem?
oh.
excellent.
here we go.
it is what made me want to become a boss.
yes.
yes well... stanley was on your group date?
and you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
no, no, no.
sometimes jan can be such a bitch.
you, my friend, would be da belle of da ball.
so, you will be okay too.
yeah.
today i did something stupid.
ok. first test.
you are welcome.
i wanted this party to be really special so i sorta went above and beyond.
it-I am-it- that was a euphemism.
probably should not have mentioned buffalo.
yes it was.
why do you have a diary?
is sex different after the baby, jim?
well, i guess it is time, that i turn over the keys, to the famous sebring.
nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck.
hey, oscar!
the mountains.
i thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while i go to the bathroom.
uh, who else we got... um...ok, all right, you guys.
hello!
or am i going on three?
she is  - we were hanging out at cafe disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury.

no, i will.
to soak up my tears.
it is... these are people's lives you are talking about.

i guess that is why i thought he ran away in the first place.
my wittle angels.
just, give her a hug.
it is moving day.
well i can, but i will have to come back later tonight and pay you.
this is not my music.
i was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual.
eight points.
i think i garner people's respect.
well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.
no.
surprised?

okay, give it to me.
we are thinking.

how do i feel about losing the sale?
we are making a commercial for dunder mifflin today.
thanks, that is, no, that... that really means a lot to me.
you know who that is?
hey!
why is christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
oh, pam please behave.
you are probably worried about pleasing bob.
i know.
what sort of movie would rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections?
it is not offensive during a roast!
just no guests.
please?
oh!
hey, that is good.
okay, here we are in the conference room.
yeah.
dwight is going to hand out index cards and i want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day.
everybody, it is my turn now, okay?
something like fat or smelly.
everybody out there says it is great!
best hr rep that dunder mifflin has ever seen.
now, i know a lot of do not think that i read your suggestions, but i do.
do some research.
do "we?" is that what "we" want?
that is absurd.
the f-word.
dwight, what are you drinking?
i do not need fresh  air, because i have the freshest air around, a.c. and i do not need wide open spaces.
yes, i am.
yes.
what do we got?
ahoy, matey.
why do not you just leave?
we got a lot accomplished.
this is fine.
i did not go to business school.
ohh!
no, that would not be- yeah.
i also saved her life, but i guess that is not as grabby.
i went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
that is great!
forty... I am in my forties.
i... this is creed.
pretend you are not here.
what time is that thing i have to do?
has anyone ever come up to you and said, "you are not creative"?
yeah, no... you know what.
okay, email accounts.
ok... lower the mic for the midget.
and women have sex before marriage and i think we need to celebrate that.
or the front of the bus.
gentleman, i would like you to meet oscar.
it is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
lay it on them.
well... i, uh...  i let her win.
nine points.
hi.
what?
i do not want dwight!
and then i went home to my condo.
keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.
they will probably watch it right away.
do not... yeah, i went hunting once.
let us proceed.
she is our receptionist.
yeah.
old bullpen.
hmm.
messages.
all right.
that I am a robot?
that is all I am going to say.
the dundies!
you know what?
and that is just... I am not better than josh.
but i still feel sorry.
they used to make stuff in america, andy.
no work.
it is quite apro-propriate.
yes.
oh, that is appropriate.
hey!
I am just saying that i think i agree with your point.
who is next, who is next, who is next, who is?
out.
one, two, three... too many to count.
so now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
yes.
just seems awfully mean.
i just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends.
there have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.
join me please, will not you?
morning everyone.
tell me what you feel.
so I am less funny than not funny at all?
those are like seventeen feet high.
this is my house.
what is so funny?
you simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck.
all right.
right here, I am going to put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.
we are grrrrrrrrrreat!"  i do not know, could be good.
tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet.
because i wanted you to come to me and say, "wow, he is so great." and i was going to say, "well, it is in the genes." and i was actually going to be wearing jeans.
i invented tactic number eight.
alert the media, and then you control the story.
oh my god!
a three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
you smell like tide detergent.
so i need you to do some work on the st. andrews account.
I am just saying, why does god get to do something that i do not?
you know what is?
hold on.
ok. tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, kelly, has invited us all to a diwali celebration put on by her community.
i can not get a stripper here.
i, michael scott, am signing up with an online dating service.
in the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
it is the people.
ok, well.
what kind of guns do you have?
she is contrapting!
raise your hands if you like to buy things.
ah, really gets you in the fillings, does not it?
I am taking two so i can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
the hillary swank version.
their industrial copier.
yeah.
you are getting past it.
that is all, you did not mean it?
i- okay, let us switch to the happy video, okay?
hey david, this is michael scott.
yes, no, why?
on the count of three, it is showtime.
so, okay.
andy?
plus perks, yes.
thank yooouuu!
well, hang in there, okay?
look, it does not matter what you say.
n-stop it!
big football star, girls loved him.

spicoli guy.
because i do not like to be cooped up in that office!
cool, cool.
i hope you are not recording this conversation.

fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
table for four.
when the leaves change.
she already has a stroller.
oh wait, i am your leader.
yeah?
ok, come on.

um, so I will talk to you later.
well.
oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
good to see you.
you are getting so funny!
bull man!
what are you wearing?
right?
I am out of here.
i am going to put a surround sound system.
did i come from a woman?
so as you know, the dundies are my legacy.
they say it is not different, but it is a different sensation.
thanks, downer.
hello?
just, shh, everybody.
it was good.
well, i can see andy proposing to angela.
as long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what i say.
i do not even know why i make it in such great quantities.
thank you.
so - see you later.
very good!
coat!
yes.
an office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... an office is a place where dreams come true.
chain of command.
okay.
it is too on the radar.
will you?
you are doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the louie volpies kid's menu, wondering: does it get better?
I am upset.
when did this happen?
wow... that is insane!
what are you wearing?
why is there a door close button if it does not even close the door?
right?
I am looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
leaving my company.
well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire.
mm-hmm.
that is why carnations exist.
says you are a security threat?
what is wrong with me today?!
eat it, phyllis.
see you guys tomorrow.
cell phones and pagers off, please.
head table, where i belong.
i hit a deer.
damn it.
and they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.
well, hobbies- pamela beesly halpert- may i have a word with you in my office please?
ok?
because he was my boss.
trick question!
i am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.
cuts?
we are going to beat this, okay?
okay, put her through.
here we go!
well, well, well.
hey, if anybody wants to go... really?
you all do it.
no.
but that is her peariagative.
can i sit down for a second?
have a seat.
i need someone to make a copy of this.
400 and one penny.
i want you all to imagine a world in which america is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello.
what are you doing?
yes, that is me.
okay, all right.
that is a good place to end it.
you are staying here until we figure this out.
tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.
it is called "curves." i went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in.
no more hugging.
i think this whole thing with sabre is going to work out.
they are nice.
i buy my suits the old fashioned way.
we are wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.
and then cnn does a story about it.
it is a pretty lame party.
she is kind of a rube.
I am doing this for appearances.
because i just learned that my father has died.
i am- oh, thank you.
I have made myself a nice pants tent shelter.
oh, i want that footage.
all right.
this is it, check that out, can you smell that?
yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
fine.
that is not true.
i was 25 years old before i saw my first human being.
what did you have, stanley?
kind of fun, inside.
yesh.
you would think they would be sick of each other by now.
guys, she is in there.
so, um... okay, if you have... if there is any other questions that you have... all right.
kay!
photos today.
my girlfriend tara, who lives in new york city.
power couple.
you are out of order.
anyone want to... pump up?
oh, stretchin'.
hmm... jim?
no.
that is a very, very funny story.
mm-hmm.
come on, give me something good!
oh, calm down, weirdo.
no.
jan in yet?
angela from accounting told me what you did.
time off for good behavior!
are we good?
but it is not like a compulsive need to be liked.
let us quit while we are ahead.
you are falling for it.
it is national ice cream afternoon.
this is where our love faces its toughest test.
i think it is crazy the coach will not play him frankly.
ugh, that is so annoying.
I am in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton, pennsylvania but I am also the founder of diversity tomorrow, because today is almost over.
i think you need to get the lead out.
just getting warmed up.
erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
uh, alright.
I am sorry.
boom.
that is true.
ok. you.
why are you looking at me like that?
are we ready?
somebody has a gun.
well, i was just thinking that maybe i should keep a salami in my pocket... ...in order to feed the bears.
y'know i do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they are always putting up walls and I am always tearing  them down, just breakin' down barriers, that is what i do all day.
no.
pam.
then listen to your ipod, pam.
absolutely.
well, you know what, it is kind of hard for me to talk about it.
hold on, hold on.
no, no.
you know what, I am thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like.
it is going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere.
what can, you can not even afford anything now, right?
i will answer your question with a question.
all right, when we get a call I will come back and you will do the smile.
it is a character I have been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble.
I am going to pull a date out of the air right now.
we do not do that.
january look, okay, i think we are all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
okay, just throw out all the empties.
hey, you know what?
and they asked me to be ring bearer.
i got on that ramp and i thought two hours, two hours to go.
because they are un-understandable.
haha!
hang on.
can you believe... because i know paper.
so, win/win.
my future prospects at sabre?
is someone there?
it is a deal.
because that is... wow, i am so happy.
i did?
you can not put a price on freedom.
what does that mean?
get in here... everybody.
good boy.
no, i can not because we do not have any emergency contact information because pam said it was not a priority." think.
stupid... tan.
want me to get down on one knee and beg you or- what?
oh, my god.
i say yes, it is christmas, but right after they are back in the thick of it.
i am eating alone.
you need to be robin shyamalan.
i can marry you as regional manager of dunder-mifflin!
you need a seat buddy?
here we go.
it is, uh... oh, come on.
everybody hates me.
why do not we just do it now?
jo, jo, i can assure you it was no one in this office.
i was looking at a trail map, and i was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I have never actually been skiing.
and business class which was basically just coach.
apu from the simpsons.
and we will wait.
i just want phyllis to have a great day.
yeah!
okay?
like mr. handell.
kevin nealon.
no, i feel it is my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
or one of you?
a baby otter?
so if there is a lesson to be learned here and I am not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.
she wants to get back together.
i do not want to have to read these tomorrow.
okay.
what!?
yeah.
i am feeling this.
come oooon... son of a bitch.
we do not do that.
and i really want a wife and kids.
look into that.
heed.
uh-uh.
oscar night.
[todd starts humping dwight and michael who are still under the desk.
okay, great.
and i will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you could not believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
there is a party in my room, 308, can not miss it, right off the elevator.
and then god, toby, you know he just... i know.
shhh.
i feel like i need that.
do not worry.
yes.
we want -- ok, alright.
i will.
and I am a little bit emotional right now because i know that i absolutely made the right decision.
mary... meredith had a little lamb.
tell alan that the mets suck!
oh.
yes.
i wrote "gay son" in green.
blooo!!
oh, is somebody making fun of me?
all right!
no, we have to cancel the party.

it is alright.
yeah, not bad, right?
i do not need a representative.
kelly?
come on!
oh... remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... look at that perm, that perm is so boss.
now, shall we get to the mystery?
it is a done deal.
let us do this!
all right, favorite moments in dunder-mifflin history.
hey you said you were going to be out of town this weekend.
or worse!
so, earlier today, stanley sassed me, and toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him.
i talk to the host about it on the air.
lot of dough.
it is too late.
thank you!
hey!
what a crazy guy.
ladies, take a breather.
they are nifty!
hr lady, stop whispering in the corner please.
so the dollar's a surplus.
so suck on that!
and then when you said that you might want to have kids and i was not so sure, who had the vasectomy reversed?
monkey pee all over you.
um... for the guests it is.
absolutely.
salesmen are the worst!
when you meet that someone special, you will just know.
phyllis, think fast.
okay.
I will make you a mix.
it is your problem.
let us get down to brass tacks.
pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
phyllis, you want to give it a shot?
then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named tom.
all right, pamela.
because i will have you know that that was consensual.
was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
i heard you drug--  i heard you dealt.
you know, despite a couple hiccups, i think that went very well.
all right, you do not respect me.
alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner.
i am beyonce always.
and her name is italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
stop talking all at once!
i do not know.
orgasms, why can women have them?
oh, wait.
i know where this is going.
i really had fun with my best friend, dwight.
alright.
come in.
why?
the shards of glass would have shaved her face right off.
it does not sound like much, but its enough for me.
so, sexy is fun... hey, you know what?
stop crying.
if we keep doing it, we are not going to want to jump.
you just do not think i am capable, of making a difference.
i was after corporate constantly.
old friend, like, you have known him since kindergarten?
okay, well, who cares?
dwight!
what is that?
toby!
so.
exactly, were not... with tolerance.
it is perfect.
toby's divorced.
boom.
hey, pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today?
a year?
roman noodles are good too.
oh!
that is-i put everything i had into that audition.
hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
ok. ok. january jan?
2:30 to 3:15.  it is going to be great.
so watch out.
you know what we should do?
and like I am going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
just tell me it is not totally insane to try one more time.
look how big he is.
we will start small.
look, i think we need to set some ground rules.
alotta rules.
thank you.
my cds are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called case logic and, um the case logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.
i do not.
it is just nature's rule.
i celebrate privately.
meh, exactly.
just ... you know what, guys?
right?
ahhhhhhhhh.
what is wrong with you guys?
i think I am a role model here.
oy vey... schmear.
to meet.
maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
see ya!
that is offensive.
did you hear what i said?
we can not overestimate the value of computers.
it is drying fast, come on.
charles really did a number on these guys.
...chris tucker.
temporary workspace.
um, "a."  "a" my name is alan, and my wife's name is alice, we live in alaska, and we sell...  damn it!
all right.
stanley?
oh-ok. morning, pam.
oh, you startled me.
no.
out, out!
she is.
it is a ream of paper.
okay, let me try this one.
no brainer, right?
respectfully, toby, no.
the more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we are all going to make.
it is uh, it is uh, very sexual.
good!
and this is not a joke.
anybody hear anything?
where is andy?
you ready?
okay, i will... I am not feeling very well right now though.
top of the morning to you!
okay, what i would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to toby flenderson?
yeah that sounds good.
yes they were.
karaoke, i love it!
yeah, yeah, yeah.
well, thank you sir.
you seriously said that?
anybody?
dwight, is that a meat sandwich?
you are the love of my life.
hello, hello, i thought that was tina fey, but it was not.
although, for the record, karen.
good to be a homeowner.
the guy, i think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... i, well, the melon baller was my idea.
and... here it is.
um, and the other bouncers caught up with me and really did a number on me... it was in the paper...  but to answer your question, yeah, I am really excited about this weekend.
happy new year, darryl!
oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile.
but i need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
okay, fine.
now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which i do.
you are the most heartless, soulless person I have ever met.
you just crossed the line.
i do not know.
he...stopped going out at night.
hoo.
i want to make fun of you right now.
holly and i are like romeo and juliet.
so... it is an analogy.
okay.
lesson learned.
it is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat.
come on!
god!
pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.
gold medals.
double ice cream.
where is the baby?
which one of these is coolest?
yep.
ok. ok yes, i would never do that.
dwight.
okay, can you tell the manager that I am keeping his delivery kid until i get a discount on the eight pizzas i ordered.
we are just friends.
very cool.
brrrrrrrr!
wow.
what?
"bend it like beckham." yeah.
what am i supposed to do here?
"sorry i did not write back sooner; i can not go to the game tonight because my boss michael is an ass and making me stay late."  well, stanley's an ass.
I am just a bee, dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'.
now, I have always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here .
where are your glasses?
bye.
alright.
oh god.
woah, wow, who told you that?
i want you to get ultra white card stock.
get 'er done.
but it is not mandatory.
i would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.
700. humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna- 1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice.
if you steal a thousand post-it notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you have made a profit... margin.
michael scott here.
yup.
alright!
this close.
a la, tonight we will be hosting at louie volpies!
pippity poppity.
you know, darryl is actually the foreman here and not roy, which is cool.
of-kay.
ok,  what does this look like to you stanley?!
she is pregnant.
now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life.
i did not hear you.
now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a sam goody gift certificate... ...and we need to be done by 9 a.m. tomorrow.
i would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
thank you.
surprise!
gentlemen, start your engines.
how then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in china has risen by 17% and in the us it has only risen by 8%?
so the next day, i decided to make that sandwich.
what are you writing, perv-ball?
i have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile.
that is really what is important.
pump up the volume.
hi.
problem solved.
that is a great way to kill this party.
and he may just make it.
you are welcome.
and as you can see they are very different sizes.
i will get out.
i do not even have a cold.
why do not you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them?
yes, and if it is a boy they will call it sylvio.
robert dunder everybody.
here we go.
lost six pounds, too.
andrew, what about you?
okay.
brain fart.
first sentence is: "I am a proctologist".

all right.
why do not you go with him?
i just think it is something that we should all be aware of.
nerd.
she sold me my condo!
yeah.
you know what, why do not go around the room and say one memory of meredith.
alright, here we go.
do you use tide detergent?
i will have the gabba-gool.
hmm.
that is unfortunate.
there is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because i know everything there is to know about these people.
watch it... please.
you greedy little thing.
um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and i heard ya, loud and clear, so, i am instituting some changes to make this more like prison.
I am sorry i called you faggie.
friends fight.
no.
one of my employees is undergoing a crisis and i wish for just once you would take my side on this.
all the way down.
these people do not realize how lucky they are.
it is the only time he can do it.
do not try to flirt your way into this.
you know what?
you could have said no.
sorry, thought i heard somebody coming in.
you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps.
real, real bad people, I am just lucky i got out.
or the day after that.
it goes to show that everything you want in life, you get.
what do you want?
what was that?
invite them on the tour.
uh... you never said anything.
yeah, I am hungry, but I am not going to make a pig out of myself.
um, this is my associate uh, from dunder mifflin, uh, oscar martinez.
i mean you can tell.
he did not want to have to struggle to survive.

honey!
how did that work out?
this movie, portrait of a... prostitute something.
i think you are inspired.
no.

it will be awesome.
ah!
oh i think i faked oscar out.
this is your time.

oh yeah... i know... that is what i was just saying... that is what... this is jim and pam, aka jap.
and i think i proved that today at the dojo.
uh, i need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
oww whoo whoo!
good.
cool.
no, no, no.
and we are the firefighter heroes.
please, please.
mmhmm.
here you go buddy, happy birthday.
you are telling me now that there is nothing in it.
hey, everybody, look what we have!
i realize that a lot of you have already heard that martin here has had some trouble with the law, but i just want to declare publicly that i... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who does not is an ignorant, dumb... person.
early.
you are disgusting.
let us meet some of the folks that make the scranton branch so special.
one more... question.
hey, look!
and guess what?
good-bye!
well, I am sure it will be fine.
wow, a thousand big ones.
you are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
no, god, please no!
that-- god.
i just want to get a fair price.
hello.
what is the dealio?
what matters to you is your precious speed limit.
here we are.
thanks for asking.
a lot of  them.
stop.
really?
i want you to bring a partner.
now we are those lazy bums.
it is new york.
mee!
let us go.
then do not do it.
somebody really got carried away with the spirit of christmas.
phil has recruited me and another guy.
so, oh!
dwight's an idiot!
i need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without ryan and pam knowing.
he is a tv announcer for the eagles.
so you heard schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
okay, well-- i will-no, no.
do not even think.
my sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .
uh, well I am afraid not.
you are on.
what do you guys think?
<i>you are</i>  unstable!
i do not know.
I am going with her.
we tried and we failed.
hardworking, motivated, dynamic.
i do actually.
so, i have a <i>perfect</i> ice-breaker if i ever meet terry hatcher.
yeah?
pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together.
taking an awfully long time.
I am very, very excited.
feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot!
i thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
it is all...  ok. what are you doing?
ok, let me be.
I am about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent.
i did do it!
what is more important than quality?
time to go to the hospital.
we need another one, immediately.
um... check your spam folder.
ah!
i could have done this investigation in like twenty minutes.
right?
now what you are feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... you are thinking, "am i good enough for this job?
no, oh, do you think that would have been good for morale?
they did the best that they could... and she is going to be ok. yes.
i saw you program it in.
look at his face!
betrayal are not just a river in egypt.
what are you doing?
i... you know... it is uh... all i want is somebody nice and sweet and someone i can talk to and share an experience with, you know?
roasted.
jim, what is that called?
please!
were you saving it?
town car is something that a company sends when they are in trouble.
you have some savings right?
we are canceling it.
it does not have to mean anything.
attention.
good.
I am usually the face of the joke.
are you being the best that you can be?
it is the "whitest sneakers" award!
probably the best one that we have ever had, right?
hey ryan, look.
uh, yeah, it is okay.
and, um, what you do, you do not just have the egg yolks, it is not like a rocky thing.
are you psyched about the summer?
i want you to say I am an alcoholic.
these are pre-cooked, so it is not absolutely necessary, but i would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I am going to be having.
uh huh.
do not mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox.
and wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food.
no!
what if we can not do it quickly?
this is uh, concierge marie... ...who works at our hotel.
how did you push away the bad thoughts?
and i have a hover-car and a hover-house.
is it a living organism?
love, michael." meredith, meredith... meri... mary had a little lamb.
it is good.
stupid load.
okay.
nobody should have to go to work thinking, "oh, this is the place that i might die today."  that is what a hospital is for.
it is just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you have no place to go but down.
thank you.
What are you guys talkin' about?
end of story.
full stretch.
yeah... i... you know what... i... i... i just thought about it.
but thank you.
ok. there are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
but we are bonding down there!
devon was one of my best buddies.
economics.
so i... I am not very articulate today, so I will just leave it for another time.
scranton is the cool, fun branch.
i do not buy woman's clothes.
sort of a virtual united nations.
come here.
mmhm!
ok. jan is smart.
what is that?
i want to see it.
he needs to lift me.
it was terrible.
stop it!
do i have your permission to invite carol?
um... wow.
guilty!
cross it off, now.
afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
there is a man's life at stake here.
who?
they kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards.
it will take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill michael scarn.
he was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
the second time... i thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.
up-dog?
i thought that you were awesome.
she made love like a tiger.
just- all right.
you can not be too careful about what you say.
haha ha.
okay, well, could i ask anyway?
look at that picture that you drew.
no.
mmm!
who am i?
i think you are great.
what happened?
you know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
hey, first guest!
ok, well, you know what?
here is what i was thinking.
jim, instead of e-mailing amazon, to try and get that cd that you did not receive, i suggest that you go to visa and tell them to cancel the charge.
yeah.
oh come on!
i want someone to follow donna.
uh huh.
might!
no, i mean this apartment building, it is fantastic.
oh.
small?
it works.
european offices are naked all the time.
do it.
what is that, pipsqueak?
this city.
permission to speak on the record?
it is like, come on, people, enough.
'I am so smart.
not that i would ever say something like that in public, and i never have, and i never will.
well, there is somebody I would like you to meet.
um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?
well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you did not mean, um, and that i forgive you for.
okay.
hey, you are going to, going to hurt yourself.
wear your wedding dress.
let us start meeting- hello.
I am asking each of you to lose five pounds.
case closed.
oh, you know what, you have a siphon?
uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through may.
well, I am looking forward to meeting terri.
that is funny.
whoo.
oh, well... kiss.
I am not a millionaire.
scranton is great, but new york, is like scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.
check that out.
all right, dwight schrute everyone.
no, i only answer to detective wallace because i got a warm body in the other room.
oh.
who would you do, roy?
you know, whatever.
i want to do it myself.
rookie mistake.
yep.
a gay.
a great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.
do not be shy, shy boy.
you might be surprised to learn that I have only been to one other wedding.
she loves to sue, loves lawsuits.
the question, whew, whew,  six points.
come on.
nice job!
this is just, not... no, then newsweek picks it up.
I have never been a fan.
she is hard and severe.
i present the orientation video.
alright, I will let you guys talk.
i think, i think you are very special.
that would be shallow.
time in!
could we please get back to this?
that is a great question, erin.
uh huh.
absolutely, pam this is exactly why i hired you as office administrator, handle it.
yeah?
ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
you can love a boss like you do a father.
or...  a whatchamacallit .
everybody pretty?
boom!
did you get the yams?
i do not need his permission.
so just shout it out.
she does not need an internet presence, you just know.
the sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about  2 of the clock in the afternoon.
stop it.
that is rude.
since the dawn of time there has been- i gave ryan the sales job.
you know what?

i want a do-over.
I am not kidnapping him, I am keeping him until i get what i want.
ok. it did.
this- no, jim.
and the best way to start is to hit start.
yes, that will work.
you are going to be okay, it is going to... ahh, ooh!
no.
that is perfect.
stanley, man the phones.
that will not be necessary.
we are very proud of you.
oh, well.
so I am going to need to train a replacement.
that makes me kind of uncomfortable.
no.
all grown up and no place to go.
two.
hello?
welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.
so you think you know a lot about business?
no, it is darryl.
last halloween i came as janet jackson's boob.
i am going to tell her that i need to redecorate my condo, and i need her help.
no, you know what?

dwight, wow.
that is very rude.
um, sort of a spy, thriller... thanks, no, i have work tomorrow morning.

spoiler... alert.
i quit my job.
so i thought, "this might be kind of fun."  and so i started messing around and... I am sinking a few, you know.
boom!
no, they are just hotties.
one of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives.
that is what she sai   nope, but... okay.
it was- ok. this is what it was.
no.
well, kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my english and start making some suggestions.
oh, pam.
coal miners, crab fishermen, dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs.
i do not have my wallet and i was going to try to dine and dash and that was stupid and i realize i can not do that to you fine people.
what is the only thing worse than one hr rep?
a child is born, "oh, oh-hum." a beautiful sunset, "no, I will catch the next one." right?
okay uh, huh.
I am hip and I am jive!
whoa!
ok, you know what?
hey, merry christmas.

everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it... this is my call jim, big picture stuff, it is about murder.
you can talk to me for as long as you want.
hungry for success.
he looks worse.
here is the thing.
i just figured out where i was supposed to go to vote.
just sound that out.
high-fiving?
toby, come on.
i want meredith to get better.
these resolutions should be about you, and i made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
that is what she said!
you missed it!
mmhmm.
only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
somewhere safe, where it can not hurt anyone oh shoot!
and you can take that to the bank.
both of them.
ok. ok... i think that thing is on the fritz.
wait a second, do people often say they are going on sales calls and then go someplace else?
here we go!
so, open wide pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.
no I am not.
i used to say "do not go there" but that is... lame.
anybody?
great.
yes.
so much for keeping our secrets up high.
still waitin' on that coffee.

back and forth.
he said that he loves going to work every day.
what are you writing?
tie these up, cheer up your tubes...  oh!
if i have to take out a client or I am seen around scranton in it.
if you keep coming after us, the michael scott paper company cannot succeed.
we have to be mature.
wait, should you be going?
and this is more a ying-yang thing.
eleven years i could have been working on the scarn nebulus.
line it up phyllis.
well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of dunder mifflin, mr. robert dunder.
well... hey, can we just focus?
ah damn.
today is diversity day and someone is going to come in and talk to us about diversity.
i... am being replaced, as your leader, by dwight.
well, yeah.

so if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just do not hesitate to ask.
wow, i want to hear your, your... oh!
yep.
crazy stuff.
how are things at the library?
nobody knows why.
i really need my job back.
all right, dwight.
i have already put down the deposit.
and the lead character, shila, is framed for murder.
or is that something that we write in later?
anybody, 300 dollars.
kevin, i have something for you.
and i would not tell the cops a thing.
what are you wearing?
end up going to sleep by the vending machine.
god!
turn it up to elevaan!
well put it aside.
I am sure he would like to take a day off.
excellent, here we go.
no... ok, she always looks like that... that is not my fault.
thanks, I am not mad at you anymore.
you will learn, baby.
up there, front and center, beautiful.
okay.
rolando,  I would like you to meet pam.
can not do that.
jim!
so, what is your poison?
you are... you are welcome.
yes, is alfredo there?
you just twist your hand until something breaks.
take my money.
ladies and gentleman, threat level: midnight.
what?
nobody owns a farm.
you me you!
there is another smaller case logic portfolio clipped to my visor   what?
and he is worthless.
i do not know.
it is a fake wheel, dummy.
oh, hey, everybody, i think that jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
jim, they are a poopy.
and before that happens i need to be in love.
ok. cool, you are on.
yes, everybody, come on.
sit down, let me wow you.
welcome back, stanley.
you all report to me!
exactly.
bond.
that was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything i did for you?
hey.
because i have him investigating her.
yes, oscar come on in.
well you do not need two of you to do that.
three hours, wow.
an age or month?
society sucks.
a rap rhyme... an urban, yeah, stanley?
confidence, dwight.
you want one of your own?
it is very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can... son of a bitch.
shortbread?
stanley!
yes, i am choosing my apprentice.
the first one is inclusion, new attitudes, color-blind... expectations....
take the drums.
look at him, he is laughing.
shh!
i give them food.
alright.
you are acting like a dork.
ahhhh!
ok, we... all right.
one time, we were out and we met this set of twins.
no, no.
because first it is all like kissy-kissy.
i guess, i did not know her very well.
last time i checked that is called sales.
probably why he was not hired.
get in-- what is it going to be, what are you going to do?
this last dundie is for kevin, this is the "do not go in there after me" award.
well, that is not what I am saying.
no.
heads.
how does that sound?
i made him what he is today.
ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
if i can just think this through, if i could just think it exactly right, i can make this perfect, and then i can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.
nnnnn-dink!
well, well, have we been blessed today.
but is it the best management?
how do you get in?
who wants a drink?
i thought you had to pee.
come on!
oh god!
stanley, got to play hurt.
no.
is oscar around?
that is our street!
everybody look away.
when i was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... i worked side-by-side with a fellow named todd packer, and together we rocked the office .
where did you find him.
not america is number two.
well what is it exactly?
pam is sort of a medium helper.
do you like it?
no, you are supposed to say, "rock the house." that is my corner.
when will she be ready?
that... no, no, no.
she drives a green camry.
i would like to introduce you to mr. danny cordray.
here we go, fourth time's a charm.
oh, okay, i get it.
even though i was there for disciplinary reasons.
i am very happy right now.
your advice was good, but jan's was bigger.
it was something else.
you are not into her?
no it are not.
right now.
i know.
i was in the hospital room with her.
vikram does not have my people skills.
can not set  them up like that.
no no no no no.
you are good.
it is... pssssh... .
i should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that i go to.
you ok?
not now.
thank you sir!
that is just so disgusting!
show me some attitude.
a little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up.
do you know who that is?
or as my ex might say.
come on please!
you want to go out?
come on, think.
totally throws  them off.
yeah, yeah he is the worst.
if you can hear me, I would like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you.
stop it.
make a note.
mister overdramatic, what is up kevin?
i was there... and I will tell you what.
oh my god, oh my god.
toby, what did you do?
and this is where we first made love.
what you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that is been said is untrue, including "stanley is having an affair." it is like the end of spartacus.
let us see... i do not need $645; i already have $645, more or less.
no.
you.
a human life.
you are a good salesman.
why do not we all proceed in to the conference room?
this is b.s.
certainly not because of the paycheck.
hey.
right.
okay, what does that mean?
let me explain something to you.
do not.
I am michael scott.
see, i wanted somebody to take it.
oh, god.
some days i am just on fire.
people are always coming to me.
andy, cornell called, they think you suck.
...chunky.
no, you are not going to quit today.
dwight, i want you to be in charge of the press conference.
to sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - tuesdays and thursdays.
i do not get it!
and you know why?
i am a licensed, classy driver in the state of pennsylvania.
this place is not prison.
english?
hey, is that healthy food?
nice work, per usual.
tell us about your divorce.
all worked out in the end, though.
you ever seen a suicide?"  and i jump.
it is trying to stand up...  there it goes.
i know, angela.
stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.
that is where you come in.
hi, erin.
ok. that is ok. that is not a problem.
circle up, please.
thank you.
check out the ass.
a secret about phyllis.
well, what if i told you that i have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes?
stanley, phyllis.
no gould?
the leads that sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet.
swingers.
assistant to  the regional manager.
so, catch-22.
i love that.
ok.  oh, wait a second, wait a second, that is hers.
she just left... and i never got closure.
it is 4:30 in the morning.
okay, good.
i owe you an apology.
hhhh... okay.
okay, enough, enough, enough!
and that i have been framed.
alright.
ohhh, god.
give him until the end of the day, he will call.
i love it!
topic, potpourri!
yep.
okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
these are the people who will open their hearts to you.
oh...  oh, my god.
yep.
that is nothing.
how can you eat like that?
oscar is back.
ah, ah, ah, what?
yeah.
no, no, no, no.
did you do that, man?
how so, specifically?
win win win.
here we go.
we could sell medicine and other... well... this might not be the right time, but i need more than i originally asked for.
do you have any single friends?
let us go.
i love it more!
i am ready to make a point!
I will take her to lunch.
just a wet blanket named pam.
and you know what you are going to have?
i do not know, regular.
want me to come over?
that is exciting.
what is he wearing?
so which way are you leaning?
whoa-ho.
did you have a good lunch?
yes.
</i> we filmed this during an actual scranton high school hockey game, trying to qualify for states.
no, no, no, no, no!
you know what this is?
okay, okay... here is the thing.
questions?
how long is this going to take?
h-i... ...r-p-e-e-s no, i am calling to see if you gave me herpes.
ahhhhhh!
martin nash, i presume?
hey.
what is that?
kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
well.
i do not.
let us not be gloomy here man.
you are fired like a heart attack.
maybe some italian.
in your face are you calling karen?
attention everyone, before i leave tomorrow i would like to reveal a secret i have kept for over twenty years.
you are welcome.
yes, you did.
woop!
almost as good as the first day when we first met.
not the real world: scranton.
where was the heart?
saint bernard.
who else?
see?
what did you think was going to happen?
what, stop!
so we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slo-mo, drinking latte.
oh, god, you know what?
okay.
have you ever seen a magician's assistant?
abso-fruit-ly.
is that what this is about?
and then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image.
bush league!
shall i?
um, that is, how did you get that from what oscar's saying?
ok... ignore him.
hang on tight.
it is a tankard.
i love that face.
and that you were the blind one.
not on the surface, no, but i can tell people are disturbed, david.
she can talk!
dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
now, remember that honesty... ...empathy, respect...  jim!
what about you, phyllis?
it is been a week, and i still can not believe it.
no!!
ok. obviously I am not going to do the twirl.
the perks.
he loves the work.
phyllis!
ahh, thank you.
so i am out.
this is the birth story.
okay.
and you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.
there it is!
yes!
we will put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
you have just never seen it.
i would love that.
i had to fire somebody this year.
devon, wait, please.
so are we set for refreshments?
i just... i feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
exactly that.
there are ... 4 corners in this room.
ow.
god.
here we go.
whoa, whoa.
ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, pam?
hey.
choose your tribes.
why do not "we" take a vote on it?
why do not you tell us?
really?
i want you to be me, and i will be creed.
check her out.
that is not current.
did everybody know about this but me?
ugh, and you know what?
it is showtime!
after you almost killed me?
oh do not raise your voice to me!
all right, I will be right back.
jim and pam and cece really seem to be clicking.
here we go!
oh, sure you would.
no.
stop it.
so, eric.
all right.
hey.
no, she did not say that.
yes, you are.
we broke up on the drive.
ladies and gentlemen.
idiot.
well, then, they need our money more than ever.
let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
i can not do this.
do not put my jacket.
there has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
okay.
too fat.
do you want the raise or what?
the fundamentals of business.
there is something wrong with everybody in here.
I am turning myself in right now!
just a second.
ok, hey, man, how is it going?
oh, my god!
get the car.
do not be shy.
hey.
pencils down.
nah, I am almost done.
city so nice they named it twice.
he is never going to find out.
all right?
right?
I am not listening to music!
oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what?
that is based on your past behavior.
probably left them in the trunk of my car.
england is number two.
yeah, i know i understand... we are making great strides and we are updating, but business as usual, no?
reverse psychology.
yes?
saber.
i sent it in.
we are going to switch back and forth, the driving.
hi.
go!
dwight, do not, do not be a suck up.
I am just too busy.
the three stooges.
uh, hey... creed?
like stanley, having an affair?
it is grotti.
never, never talk specifics.
we are infinitely sorry.
china should be like eight.
that is right!
oh, we have a serious problem here.
thank you sah!
jim, why do not you show of your dundies to the camera?
there is a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development.
oh, i do not know, james.
hey, stanley.
and do not call me shirley.
and, hey, do not embarrass me when we go to niagara.
you first.
yeah, alright, so i want you to give him your undivided attention and mr. franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave i give you permission to spank them.
they, no.
oh.
alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we are going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
that was a test.
five years from now, what do you want to do?
yes.
look at that.
oh but i can push drugs in here?
congratulations meredith.
check this out.
excellent.
they grow up so fast.
cool it.
no.
am i too short?
believe me its nothing.
oh.
i can not andy, it is too hard.
you started with this company, as a fine young man... oh, okay.
everyone is going to end up dying someday.
all right?
that is vodka and i mixed it with orange juice.
run!
i did not find a perfect moment, because i think that today was just about just having today.
come on people, let us get  them in.
and there is our smudgeness.
ha ha, you are!
i mean i love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women.
those girls really wailed on you bad.
okay, you know what, toby?
pam, can you come in here, please?
you said you would do it!
yeah!
please pass your future mrs. michael scotts forward.
just do your best buddy!
hello, good morning.
andy, she is not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with.
yes.
uh well, yeah of course.
i did.
oh!
life is a road-- how, would you stop interrupting please?
we will see what dwight says.
or making love too beautifully.
I am... what?
well this is it.
shh.
i was not smiling that time and they can tell too.
thank you!
and you know what?
nobody better try to stop me.
yeah.
oh my god!
ohh.. can not you?
i was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
yes!
it is a weird day for false facts.
maybe we should test it first.
shall we?
and most of that was just birds in my condo complex.
okay.
milk and sugar.
congratulations.
oh, let us fix you up.
so who is the godfather?
next best thing.
sometimes... ...you just gots to get your freak on.
look at that.
come... come on!
oh, holly does not need luck.
my heart says... that is true.
no.
and without denying the seriousness of the situation, i would just like to remind you that in much of the netherlands, swimming naked is the norm.
what?
there was one true rumor out there today.
it is called prerogative.
i do not need you to give me a history lesson.
what are you talking about?
i am headed to philadelphia for the annual northeastern mid-market office supply convention.
can not you stick to anything?
uh, i meet a lot of people.
no.
good night.
because we do not have a lot of time.
someone complained that the men's room is "whites only".
i am beautiful.
oh!
the boys' department.
i just do not agree.
because he is afraid to fly.
it was the 05 05 05 party... ...it happens once every billion years.
pretty good.
you will have pancakes and you will like it.
I am throwing up.
yes!
ohh, god!
i got that off the internet.
tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips... ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
very delicious.
we will?
really?
I am sleeping with pam's mom.
what do you mean?
you may leave; goodbye.
very good.
kevin the tax man.
they say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake.
jim, as a matter of fact, i have printed out ten ways to induce labor.
no, i can not talk to her.
kiss her good.
because you can not always tell, so... how would i know.
much better.
hello son.
jo!
everyone.
get back to work.
the company's doing fine.
i think it is tiny.
wait!
so, yes, i think i bought us some time.
okay!
...good.
because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we do not get downsized.
the day he is born.
stop it.
what if i told you i had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
who is it?
today is toby flenderson's last day.
hi, i am michael scott, i am the captain of this party.
does not matter, it is an order.
hey!
idiot.
book club.
well, i guess i did not score and I am not sure who is actually shooting, but, whatever.
it is all kind of weird.
i spy?
great, okay.
yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
right.
he got a job.
they look very happy.
hey.
let me get your stroller.
I am sick of it jim.
how long have you worked here?
just shut up.
yes, i was watching jim's face.
hey!
um?
is it wrong to keep seeing her?
jim is back.
it is a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
no time!
yes.
stop it.
that guy?
oh, pam with a zinger.
because, that is the way these things are done.
i mean, they are just dough twisted up with some candy.
so that was my worst birthday.
I am michael scott.
I am sure.
i think it has a... yeah, it has a deck.
hell no!
for those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs.
i think i blinked.
probably will not.
solution:  angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
come on.
why do not we just, live and let live?
or dig up a body... toby?
yes, i know that.
also i would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our... trouble.
um... okay.
hello.
do not mind if i do.
they all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift.
is not it?
i like to stay tight.
in five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake!
i know what a lot of you must be thinking.
well, then it will be easier for you.
exactly.
an accident borne of jealous feelings.
well, you could take the bus.
i started a fire, i started a fire.
thanks for the advice.
i am a big fear factor fan.
oh god!
well, this office is my pool.
very good.
yes, exactly.
you writing your memoirs over there?
no, you can not have it.
i do declare.
thank you.
alright, i am looking forward to this.
it is, uh, right there.
the point is you just have to play with the cards that you are dealt.
just do your work ... while you still can.
I am not darryl.
it is good.
obviously.
sweet, i will go invite holly.
gay porn, straight porn, it is all goooooood!
do you want an m&amp;m?
what?
no!
and it is style 3. and it is not ideal.
jim, good party, huh?
i am so deliriously happy... because you are pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together.
why?
darryl?!
carol used to drink lattes.
i would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.
yeah, well i was not very hard to find.
yep.
want to, christian, blossom?
it contains a file, a picture.
we are going to go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we are going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, i would like you to forget everything that toby has said, okay?
three.
it is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes.
count the other way.
why do not i tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?
he is in an all-out sprint.
i have been the third wheel so many times in my life.
i need a username.
oh, god.
thank you.
... really ruined eighth grade for us.
scranton!
now, i think i have had a little stroke of genius in that i have had my assistant pam... smile, pam.
this is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.
he leaves work, he is on his way home... wham!
have fun.
people, hold on, hold on.
come on, I am busy.
thank you everybody!
i do not kn- anything's possible.
nope, you cannot use it.
ok, you know what?
i hope you are happy.
and they said they could not guarantee it if there is downsizing, okay?
exactly, yes.
who let the 'nard dog out?
phyllis!
I am calling it crime-aid.
ready?
haha, we struck the mother load!
they are getting on my nerves mom.
five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
that is not how business works, okay?
do not ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what.
yes!
okay, be my guest.
chhguuh!
hi.
there you go!
yeah, obviously you are.
sorry, sorry, sorry.
do not get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there.
you are just as stubborn as your mother, when you do not want to do something you just do not do it.
wha - no.
go back to work!
this is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive.
i just want to go in and fix it.
either or.
only if he fails.
nohting.
oh hey!
it is too late.
i wish i could, andy, but i can not.
I am just saying, that - honey and jelly sandwich time.
i am not dating january she was very clear about that.
like an improv conversation.
nothing to fear.
very good.
that is it.
dunder mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named sabre.

yes you can, you are single, I am single.
hello.

maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
really safe.
oh, he is doing it, okay.

mmhmm.
I am trying to be a good mentor.
indubitably.
and the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt!
bommmm.
i would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science.

mm, that is not sexual, just... we are all professionals.
i did not say that to make you feel good.
women's appreciation.
obviously, he did not because you all still look relatively happy.
w-i do not understand.
well, thank you.
and jim halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun.
i knew it.
ok. yes, right in here, come on in.
yeah, I am looking at it right now.
why do not we... pump some iron?
i do not want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
here we go.
i would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
there has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.
so what is going on?
but, at the end of my life, when I am sitting on my yacht, am i going to be thinking about how much money i have?
just forget it, yeah, yeah.
and i would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me.
nothing.
that would be perfect.
if it is not stop and shop, i send it back.
what happened here?
what?
because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
god!
I am in.
i did it!
you forged them!
what?
oh.
i suspect jim halpert."  "everyone has called me 'dwayne' all day.
ok, that is our street!
and he actually hooked up with one of the students.
so we are starting with account setup- okay, can i have that?
eeee.
wow.
do not... please... i... just... would you put it up?
pam, productivity starts with patience and determination.
let us both.
I am his boss actually.
and all we had were the facts.
pan around there.
wow, very cool you went back and got your degree.
the point I am trying to make with all of this people is that i hate drugs.
i wish you would not interrupt.
what the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
let us go to the break room.
there is going to be a free room?
are you ready?
oh god!
poor richard's number seven?
love that andy, right?
big fat fatty.
and eight tries added up.
i can go earlier.
do not help him.
hey batter batter batter.
and how is that been going?
and it does not hurt that my ex works for corporate.
oh, party in the break room!
okay.
it looks terrible.
okay, um, count me in as who cares.
pros: smart, cool, good-looking.
i appreciate that, thank you.
take heed of.
oh, you do?
why do you even want to stay at dunder mifflin?
here... who is here?
not my style.
ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, i see.
no.
oh ho ho no, no, no, no.
i have herpes.
i can not even say it.
look at that.
going to sleep it up all night.
it is a classic management tactic.
okay.
this is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories.
no, uh, no.
yes, you did.
somebody hurt?
bros before hos.
nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them.
no, no, no, no.
then i went back to the lake.
what, um... what do you think of role-play?
yeah, oh there you go.
there we go!
that is a piece of cake.
what can i do to make it more perfecter?
no, creed, no they are not.
what is so wrong about me?
no, they do not.
i got this for helping save the company money.
it is delicious, it is good for me.
it did not come up organically.
what does that even... well, gay pride, right?
first up, proficiency in necessary skills.
oscar?
what is up spinsters?
oh, god!
in that moment, i had them.
hurry, please.
i will be back momentarily, all right?
well, jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
um, no, i just thought we would wing it.
nah.
yes, please.
and the same thing goes for quarterly reports.
i just figured you might have- oh!
ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
am i going to tell them?
i do not know.
scranton!
mmm-hmm.
oh, that was classic.
no, no, no, no!
oh do not go.
hmm.
will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
perfect.
he and i came up together as salesmen.
the only thing that makes any sense.
great, i mean, i guess you guys are working saturday.
i know, what you did.
i basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then i find out that one of my best ones did.
because she did not like one message i left on her voicemail?
did not do background checks of the warehouse guys.
this is my point!
a lot of women do!
to change lives.
and because you are gettin' old.
what i think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight... no way.
oh, there is gill.
i will be taking jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.
you can not put words back in your mouth.
that sounds good!
those guys from vance refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
very good.
yeees.
all right.
that is what i have to say.
you said that i could not invite dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we did not have enough wine glasses.
what is a stapler!?
i think it is too small if anything.
thanks.
yes.
really?
plus, bonus, it is really, really funny.
mmmm... ... i asked for trick candles.
right?
that is not how it works.
who else here is single?
idiot.
question.
cocoa.
congratulations.
oh god- no, no, no!
he is a man.
big day.
unh.
hey guys!
we already have a buyer.

we just - we need - let us - you know what?
yes.

pam?
right, pam?
okay?
<i>here</i> is your headline.
we have a monthly staff meeting what?
phyllis, did i or did i not say fruit?
i will have a girlfriend once she sees this place.
that is what she said.
tell her i hit a cat.
gooooo-tee!
tell me what pam's brain is thinking.
it -- i agree.
okay.
it was pretty funny.
so... just sit down kelly.
bad management!
you are a mom.
yeeesh.
right?
what do you think?
go!
that is insane.
you did not actually think i was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
that is what oscar said.
ooh.
well then... i am glad you are ok. business is like a jungle.
in some cultures, when somebody leaves, like new orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets... if the devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
my point is... that as long as people like you and me do not stop talking, nobody can stop the usa.
do not pimp me, all right?
we were more than we were.
ah!
hello ry.
congratulations phyllis.
well, now ok, i know that this is probably not appropriate, but i need help.
we will go.
the 45 day thing that i outlined, we go with that.
it was very nice.
we all will!
pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so i can focus.
no, it is a perfect smell-alike.
and after that, nobody ever messed with the 'damn rascals' ever again.
who else?
mimosa.
the cfo?
i do not want any special treatment, pam.
why do not you guys head home.
and you do not.
i was thinking about getting "back to the future."  "back" because it is on my back and "future" because I am the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future.
have you met that kid?
all of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
how did i propose, let me see... well, i drove her up to nashua, and i had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful.
let us go do it to somebody else.
excellent, it will be fun.
what should i do, david wallace?
shut it... shut it!
what?
educational.
great job.'  that is what it is all about.
this... just in.
no, i was being negligent.
now we are cooking.
i learned a while back that if i do not text 911 people will not return my calls.
no, no no.
no, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
the it tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
in monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
look at my eyes.
ok, alright i got to go.
come on!
six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes.
so i think i know what i need to do at this point.
pam.
i did.
are you kidding me?
'the village', 'unbreakable', 'sixth sense', 'sig... ' okay.
and it is not even about who is the best sumo wrestler.
the name is bond... santa bond.
i am still the same old michael scott.
umm, all of the children of the world.
jan levinson, i presume?
stanley in the house, everybody.
mission accomplished.
for the insurance money!
whose got one, whose got a big idea?
wow!
can i talk to you for a sec?
that is it!
so in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts.
act.
city of love.
just say, "i want to squeeze them."  it is code.
who could it be?
I am trying!
okay...  heeeere's what we are going to do!
okay.
who is going?
well, that figures.
help.
they think it was somebody else.
yeah, i hear ya.
mm-hmm.
the guy was trying to sell me insurance.
we are all going to have a good time tonight!
in fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability.
oh, man.
sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole martin in prison thing.
everybody, let us keep  them coming... oh, god.
you people are jerks.
I am not changing that, it is the best one.
ok... merry christmas.
good job.
slept like a baby.
sexual harassment.
when we were going out?
if i go by myself everybody will think I am a big loser.
kudos to ryan, king of the party committee.
the customer is always right.
everybody I would like to introduce you to elizabeth.
attention please.
zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel.
well, it goes, it goes in the best direction, and that was not the best direction.
you and pam.
what?
pam-pam-pam-pam-pampampampam!
oh wow!
all right.
her passwords are not going to be dwight, dwight.
you know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?
I am being misogynistic.
i have rights.
is it safe that park that in my driveway.
it is ok, they are with me.
do not look at me people.
aww, none of your business.
that... exists?
I have dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
how did this happen, how did i get this?
are we over budget?
so... behold our bachelorette .
fun on wheels.
burger with cheese!
it is michael.
what are you... what are you talking about?
yes, i do not... i know, i know.
oh!
what?
everybody's looking at you right now.
no, darryl.
just a cold sore, thank you.
did somebody order a hooker over here?
who did you have?
i do not... remember.
young sir, would you like a free pancake?
oh... oh no, not the huggy monster!
okay, you know what?
no, it is not beef... just... sit down, please.
pam, please note that jim is very astute.
they suck.
umm... mema, i think you just need to chill out about this whole pam getting pregnant thing.
you know what?
hello.
whoa whoa whoa!
why do not you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.
yes, i just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to jamaica with me.
you get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so santa does not have to go through this again.
any questions?
ahh!
and just bear in mind when i say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that i, if i were you, that i would not want to hear... well... no, I am not.
i mean, we know we are going to start dating.
on the first day.
okay, what?
i do not... well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
david!
but it is not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen.
no pun intended.
come on start us out.
look, prison stinks, is what I am saying.
astrid, this is everybody, look.
absolutely!
no.
and pancakes?
what, what is this?
the bartender asked for her id which i thought was odd because i pegged her at like 35. yeah, it was weird.
he is cool.
come on.
what am i going to do?
that - that was embarrassing.
well you do not get it, because stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you are... you.
never ever, ever sleep with your boss.
to find a kid he liked better.
you can do it, just say it.
how is everybody doing?
that is, like... yes, you have tapped this.
and if this does not bother them, then i am out of ideas.
that looks delicious.
do not do that.
do not excite him.
stop it!
i do not... once in a lifetime opportunity people!
well, then just have the tomato and ketchup.
it is going to be an incredibly hard decision.
ask him his name.
happy diwali!
how is the lady situation?
that will be all.
follow me, i will show you where all the slaves work.
we are half way done.
love is a mystery.
and i think other people have told me that i have a very symmetrical face.
then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest.
this is the moment when scranton and stamford come together as one.
it is another thing, you bossing me around.
y-you can-michael.
it hit the rim.
no.
oh, she is cute.
ok, let us go have some fun.
well, that is... yep, never been used.
do we want that?
what was the deal with the guy jumping overboard?
i do not know.
lifeline.
ok. why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea?
oh my god!
and then you put a wire on him and you find out who is selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch.
all right.
we need rock n' roll pam, rock n' roll.
offer revoked.
oh, oh, oh!
look at how long it took for him to find out.
you have big plans for tonight?
good, what is funny?
uh oh!
god!
you know?
you will love it.
woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
were you listening to what i was saying?
okay.
heh-woh you.
because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
they did not call me.
what?
just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
uh, here is the thing.
what is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
are you serious?
mm-mm.
okay, pam... she is not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
you know what, okay, excuse me.
however you want to do it.
i would sleep in my office, and i would sexually harass people.
kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
well, no.
yes you are.
okay.
drugs?
there is always a distance between a boss and the employees.
god!
no bad ideas.
and you made hank smile, that does not happen often.
that one says, "i am so lame." know which one i want?
I will see you tonight.
today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
no body go in there.
that is his punishment for not being here on time.
i can help you, too.
happy birthday!
shh.
i do not talk to my girlfriend about money.
not bad for one day.
yeah, yeah... uh, i can not do this pam.
second... yes, second, toby.
mmhmm.
we get right in the car, we pop up to montreal.
whatever you think will work.
dwight?
i can not do this myself.
no.
you know what, I am going to take that one step further.
okay... dwight... stop... oh... kay... okay.
so i had to- I am sorry, sorry.
here we go, let us sit down.
see.
uh, yeah.
yes, in theory, i have.
dwight gave a great speech.
i bet luke perry's friends do not treat him like this .
you want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
and I will be taking pictures all along the way.
and now we are going to honor it.
kevin.
we will go to the dump, we will look around, then we will all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night.
that is a train whistle, like I am the conductor.
what about our truce?
you can do the old way or whatever you think would work.
in a folder?
nanoo, nanoo.
it, we both, i did not want it, we both did not want it to continue.
okay, I am going to give it shot.
i am going to call corporate.
you did not get the joke.
pretty cool, right?
oh, no no no, no, no.
okay, that is uh, hard to keep track.
i mean, what... was it toby?
it is me.
no, it is not that bad.
nope.
hey everybody, i just invited jim to suck it, and i am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon.
how do you-ho.
some idiot named mark greg sputnik will claim credit for it.
same thing.
no, I am whipping them.
okay.
and do not sign your name to it.
i feel terrible about it.
no, you did not see me in there with her.
sexual time bomb.
am i the only person who enjoys people watching?
um.
oh, you got to be kidding me.
i do not know, that is why you are here, help me.
we have almost got it.
you are ok. you are ok. let us lie down.
let us go!
how about this one?
it was all made up.
look, look.
help me!
my point i this: i have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
check that out.
i do not have a girlfriend.
there is a line and you went over it.
you sexy thang you." here you go.
hello.
i have done things like um, "beers in heaven." or, "total eclipse of the fart." i love to sing them, but i am not going to be doing that today.
yeah, I am pretty excited too.
the electric city.
it does not matter.
and jan and i are going as a couple.
get pam.
nowhere.
I am glad i signed.
that is what faggie means!
we have an offer from washington university.
these are my associates.
oh man!
you are losing you.
an oven mitt?
you are next.
and i know in your day she would be considered a who are but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them.
it hurts my heart.
i could not have agreed with you more.
ping?
my resolution?
not crack the drug.
like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he is tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.
and frankly, the stuff that we are into is not very condo-appropriate.
helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and i envy it.
whataya say?
mm.
yes?
that must have been fun.
do not gloat.
right?
i know.
for those of you who do not know me, I am michael scott, phyllis' boss.
i can not imagine the sex being bad, i mean her body is... ...awesome.
would you like to go to lunch with me?
so we are good?
bye.
i actually hung this on the wall myself.
what is that?
so many things.
okay, so you are dating somebody?
da  na na na na.
hello!
wait, hold, hold, hold... so it is true?
iraq is sand.
delightful.
ever since i found out that donna might be cheating on me, i have not eaten or slept.
what i am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are.
hey, ernie, how ya doing?
what are you doing?
yes.
I am not following you.
no more.
call poison control if you are bit by a spider.
and i consider oscar a friend.
michael scarn shoots and then asks questions later.
i know, i know, i know.
i do not see a... price.
where are we?
well, thank god you did not steal my oven mitt.
i bet he knows nothing about boobs.
i owe you one dwight.
thank you.
what are we doing, dwight, what we are doing?
that is inappropriate, pam.
okay.
jim, we are getting crapped on.
they use props.
you are mean girls.
here is what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.
now I am getting her voicemail.
let us do this.
no, no, no, no, no-no, no no.
some people need dozens of friends to say, "hey, look at me, I am popular." but not me.
good.
that is, you know what?
i am unreachable.
if i were joking, you would be laughing.
it is a 45 day plan.
the "spicy curry" award goes to our very own kelly kapoor!
ok. ouchy.
two, incest.
ok, what kind of machine is that?
oh, no.
it was a good idea, though.
mm-hmm.
nah.
no, he is not.
ryan how are you today?
so get your charities in to pam.
and i am obviously the joker.
did you enjoy your food?
but i do not see it that way.
why?
toby flenderson to the principal's office.
people... everybody does it.
this office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
no.
give it, give it.
yes, kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a bynes or a hope.
oh, god!
i saw it!
alright, i am a local business owner.
thank you to our hosts.
"michael, i have a secret.
it will be good.
yes.
what it is like to walk a mile in oscar's shoes.
so... yes, you did.
phyllis, can you do this?
no- no i am not.
make it happen.
ok?
fine.
i do not even have jan's cell phone number and i hate her!
same letter here and here.
and i feel like i need to go to nashua and get closure.
tell me later.
there is no such thing as playful hazing.
jim, that guy is an ace.
eww... apricot.
here we go!
... you can pick that up, if you want.
uh... yes, yes.
it is the european cut.
an african-american father of two, stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we are hoping to build our bases on.
there are only three rules.
this is the worst!
i am coming to your party.
i love you.
holly, come on in.
i do not understand.
it is, yes.
did we get any mail?
it is time to go it is time to go.
this is the performance of your life!
i will not.
i am going to give you a little blast from the past of michael gary scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'fundle bundle.' okay?
do not you love it?
i would like to see those please.
I am buying it and I am not renting it.
okay.
i am a great motivational speaker.
i do not have time for parties i do not have time for tv shows.
come on, let us go back to the party.
ah, fine.
good ideas are simple.
let us see.
I am a crazy eight, I am crazy.
he does not have the authority to say that.
wow, you have really grown up.
anybody else.
oh, man, i can tell you confidently that it is not going to be okay.
I am spending a fortune on gas and tolls - um, that... i do not know.
wuh, how, how old are you?
right now, right now!
good.
well, he is just thinking about his own gifts.
and now your wish will not come true, so that blows.
good.
i know that you went to corporate this morning, and i know that you lied about it.
I am michael scott, dunder mifflin.
only one that i was kind of worried about.
or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
they are jealous of two people in love on valentine's day.
i have your baguette.
and queens .
uh-huh.
like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
dwight, ryan, i want you to take the table out.
being oogled.
great!
now i need a noun.
i believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters.
i like his hair.
dwight.
knit like the wind.
kelly, ryan looks great.
like benjamin button in reverse.
cool.
he needs to learn humility, alright?
i am so glad that i bought instead of rented.
all right, here is what I am going to do.
you got to help me here.
i had no idea when i got in that car and headed to new york i was going to quit.
I will give you $50.
i wish i had prepared something to say.
hospital!
i remember you told me that you loved the willy wonka movie when you were growing up.
no.
going to be fun.
not.
yeah!
we do have to get along.
okay.
i usually have a radar for stuff like that.
that should not be there.
more foot traffic.
okay.
that is what christmas is all about.
grandpa, where were you the day the the scranton strangler was caught?
that is my line, that is... i always say that at weddings.
i need some filing done.
liar!
who are we going to save?
ow!
we have about an hour and half.
when you told me everyone was canned.
this is going to be nothing like the party you have been planning.
and  then another and another and another.
people, this is scranton.
is she crazy in bed?
yes, it is.
nothing but gruel.
we did it?
bummer.
no, of course not.
i have a plan and i am going to save our jobs.
we could spread out a blanket in the break room.
yeah.
i just sift through them every week and i really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.
if anything i am robbing the grave.
and i miss you, man.
do i stress you out?
he has got this very likable way about him.
oh.
ye - ok, yes.
three, two, one, go.
no.
that is me.
well here we are... i would just like to... alright then everybody, I am outta here!
that is right!
nice.
well the number three is not such a giant feast.
cons: i do not really trust him.
for the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes.
you are now sexy in your culture.
one more hour.
two car parking... ...wall-to-wall carpets... ...all fixtures included.
you know who used to sit at that desk?
we do not know what they are going to say.
so chill.
what do i write?
there is a lot i have not done.
I will give you a hint.
it is not about the fit.
undefeated season.
you go to sleep, it is light out, you wake up, it is dark.
you are mean.
wow!
whole year, actually.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
oh!
umm... oh!
some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing.
and when i came to, i had an epiphery.
yeah, they work.
i was a greeter.
i did not, not, not use those words.
fine.
i have a very important decision to make.
there he is!
ok?
hey, there he is!
this whole pam/ryan debate is screwing with my head.
good to see you.
oh kay, mind is exploding.
when i knock on your door, you know who it is; it is michael scott.
I am sick of this place.
mmm-hmm.
i do not know what the  that was.
okay?
thirty-one's my number.
i would like a pair of size nine, please.
it is good.
they did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so i am now going to fake fire him.
totally undercooked.
because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
nellie nutmeg, come back in here.
oh, hey karate kid.
shove it back!
and the breakfast.
he went to cornell.
pam let us go.
jo, i do not know how things work in florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
why did you just say he was the boss?
woooah!
oh, it smells good in here.
the party I am having tonight in 308. obviously, you are invited.
i did not, you know, it was... it was dark, for one thing.
hey, i just got off the phone, and i was going to make another call.
you know, dwight, there was a time when you would be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
you are playing right into their hands.
this is you we are talking about.
so I am going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
dunder-mifflin is the big picture!
for accounting, a brand new printer.
maybe i was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
i have something here.
more than the bible, I am not surprised.
i hate to do it this way but, you know, that is just... we are having a friendly game.
no, i think you are going to stay.
how can i put this?
ughh... blech.
um... uh, ok. well, great, well, you know, it will be a surprise.
that just- you have really grown.
I am just calling to say that i think we need a little break, permanently.
see you in a few months.
no.
let us just... why can not you just forgive... why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?
no, she is... she is fooling around.
how long is it?
we are to respect him.
get away from that, dwight, please.
i just got back from vacay.
get your free pancakes.
t.m.i.
hey.
and we are going to sell that to charity.
hey, congrats on the bonus.
because you are grossing me out.
seriously.
who cares?
just, shut up.
all right, switch.
okay.
that is all you need.
from me, big time.
we will wait for the call and you will smile.
hello?
and i would survive.
yes.
just a second.
mmhm.
that way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
that is, you know what?
that is a dog.
that is fun.
yes, i do!
do not start any fires, ryan.
nice to see you again.
you lost a ton of weight, literally.
we are-  sorry.
it is not a popularity contest.
sometimes, dinner.
you need the big guns, yes?
well... just do it, okay?
use it in good health.
any one else?
well, i have a late birthday and usually september's a cut-off point.
i will call david and give him the customer list and i will give him all my info.
yes, jim, i do.
this woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink.
no problem.
mmwwah !
just... eat it.
alright let us just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
although he is a tool.
go to new york, confront the cfo, show him he is making a mistake... save the branch.
are you kidding me, that is who you are worried about?
now it is your turn.
i just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
look at that  bwup-bwa!
it... no.
hmmmmm?
there is a wishing fountain at the mall.
i did not say it, i declared it.
oh yeah?
oh, very thoughtful.
jim halpert.
okay, anyway, welcome.
ow!
and i take that as a compliment.
okay, security guard.
i also uh, subscribe to usa today and american way magazine, that is the in-flight magazine.
i think that goes without saying.
they go, "god we have never worked in a place like this before.
do not you?
i understand.
because i have two, basically.
they just said coal hawks.
wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.
i looked straight at the bag.
we just sort of got caught up in the moment.
okay, I am going to wrap it up here.
yeah!
because I am not.
hello, what about the birthday boy?
okay.
best dad dundie!
he is happy because he is insane.
you are not prone to seizures?
it seems a little shady.
there is... a pay stub.
did you know, that bob is still a member of the board of dunder mifflin?
oh, here we go.
keep it at a normal height.
okay.
you think kids in africa have chairs?
ryan.
i might.
okay.
well, toby, if by me you are inferring that i have b.of., then i would say that is a very poor choice of words.
all right, everybody.
is it?
okay.
jim?
and, like cupid, i am going to shoot you with love.
mmm.
you are making me throw up, ryan.
sorry, sorry.
it is not a sex ed class.
how about vanilla?
oh god.
so I am just going to have my soft pretzel, then I will get to work, and I will be super productive.
well, I will send somebody to come pick it up.
okay.
i did not slip you something!
let us do not... do not harsh my mellow, mon.
yes.
in all the excitement, i forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe.
ok. yes.
is it the cash flow?
and then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
yeah, I am sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
guys, do you have a box we could use?
lists are good.
i do not care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!
my gift.
okay.
um, i was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from hr, dwight.
i love it.
for the record your mom came on to me.
here we go.
hank, thank god you are here.
just us good friends, and karen and andy.
hawaiian blood punch.
thank you.
it was early morning yesterday... i was up before the dawn... and i really have enjoyed my stay... toby must be movin' on.
how did you come up with that idea?
just go to his house and see if he is sick.
investing in real estate.
well, no no no no no... no no no no no.
hypocrite!
yes.
we should invite them to the christmas party.
yes.
is this mine or is this chili's?
ryan?
saw 'inception.' or at least i dreamt i did.
oh... actually, tomorrow's not good.
jan says anything that does not scare us is not worth doing.
you mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
i could take or leave the perks.
you still getting it regular man?
that really ripped you up.
I have seen that pond.
can i make just a little announcement.
on whom's authority?
hello, dwight.
they are going to be in this van.
yeah.
the michael scott paper company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
you are not bad, either.
right, yes, yeah.
dwight?
who eats eight protein bars?
no, i do not.
yeah.
meredith, we are doing this for your own good.
I am not a bad person, i bring good news.
what do you think?
i think i left my wallet in my car.
on our way!
that is just stupid.
ok, umm, could i just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
the people are awesome!
my word against yours.
i have country crock.
what are you doing?
michael.
it is totally impossible!
hmm?
i want some milk.
you think it is easy?
I have seen you guys around.
salesmen and profit centers.
this is him: "hey!
oh wow, are those eagles' flavors?
hello ladies.
god.
nice to meet you.
hellooo?
hey, what is up?
right?
do you have plans tonight?
the answer, whew,  three points.
we are going on a little mission.
you need to think this through in  jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
i do not understand why you keep picking on me.
oh, no big deal.
oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let us do it.
no, no.
who among you has the guts to replace me?
box it up.
would a sober person walk in front of a car?
instead of saying "dunder mifflin" at the top is there any way i could get it to say something else?
you always used to be very cautious... I would wear two condoms.
went there again, did it again.
what the hell is going on back there?
um... that is it!
no.
so welcome one and all to the world premiere of corporate crapfest!
could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
we are trying to look it up right now.
thank god.
yeah.
bad idea jeans.
um... i was wondering if i could ask a personal question about her.
woo, i will.
uuuuh... well.
and you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you.
come on, show me excited!
i am michael and i am part english, irish, german and scottish.
all the channels are going to be different there.
things are really picking up.
yes.
hey!
so good.
it is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
no!
no, i hate it!
there is no way in hell that i am going to say that we are broke.
thank you.
and I have been drinking.
whichever corner you want.
dwight!
subrahmanyan chandrasekhar.
until the day you came to replace him.
hey, stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?
set.
this office, i think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it is probably more advanced than you are used to.
this is a dream that i have had since lunch, and i am not giving up on it now.
it is not cappuccino.
mhmm, no i paid 500 dollars for that.
darryl.
yes, your corner.
having lunch by the car.
i just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head.
just remember folks, it is not about winning, it is about finishing.
stinkyfeetville.
andy?
now they can not hear us at all.
mm.
got them on their feet.
three!
oh, oh!
i can not believe it!
dwight, you ignorant slut.
okay, alright.
look, i know sales, and i had that sale, i just needed a few more minutes-- it is not a waste of our time.
every year that roy and pam do not get married, it gets funnier.
well then my man meat, he shall have.
probably get on pam.
well, i find it beautiful.
we need to find out what is blocking you.
nothing but net.
i rewarded dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
uh, yep.
i have no filter.
i actually do not understand deathbeds.
this company does not waste time or resources, ever.
ehhhhnt.
you better say good-bye to pam.
ha ha ha!
since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
two of my favorite joke areas combined.
um, no actually i got them at a fancier place.
been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but i am here to scare you straight.
hey, there!
one hour.
todd packer.
they almost bought from us.
no, we would never do that.
we are pretty much done here today.
so clean out your desk, you are through here.
who else?
come on, let us go.
is that right?
you have seen it right?
hey, what about angela?
we are like peanut butter and jelly, do not you think?
istn't it?
it is nothing personal, i promise.
find a killer joke that will just blow everybody away at the seminar later.
i do not want you to treat him like anyone else in the office.
i am not budging on the hat issue.
yeah!
because i do not want it getting back to sabre that we are yelling at assistants.
pam, make an announcement.
it is nice to see you.
and if not we can just make him disappear.
so i thought we should plant a tree.
really?
hmm?
i can be very suprising.
I am not wearing a wire, so... how much?
she is the love of my life.
and she got it, she got the suit.
stop it!
hello.
pardon me.
it was weird though.
what?
I am hitler.
do not thank me.
no, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what i think... that i do not even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and i do not know which is which... what the hell is that?
there is no open bar because of jan and it is the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum.
i can not believe you are here.
i do not know.
let us go in here.
stanley hudson, you are fired.
yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower.
jan loves this branch, and i think that is really more than half the battle.
ten years, you will figure it out.
she... no, I am not talking about paper.
okay, meredith is up first.
she thought this was a costume party!
and do not call me shirley.
no!
yes.
okay, orange slices.
hey.
we are going to turn secret santa into yankee swap.
that is a good idea.
huh.
and you two only met once before the wedding night?
packed with beautiful babies.
all right jim.
am i the princess?
he grew into a man overnight.
you will not regret this, michael.
okay, oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education.
like a grandmother.
china is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
happy birthday to you.
if i had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow i pick-up in a bar, and these people?
dwight told charles.
oh, god.
and remember no matter what, i will always love you.
who are we going to... ryan.
uh huh... great what is the pink?
you want to have a kid?
i took charge.
oh, my god.
oh, that is okay, she can keep those.
I am going.
we all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.
and now you can not return it.
meeting confirmed.
ok, foul.
hi, honey.
it is a lie.
i did not.
well, tell me about jocelyn.
oh, god.
a blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.
so... you are the moron.
there you go.
does everybody want a raise?
yes.
i-i swear, nothing happened.
definitely.
would you agree with that?
would you cut it out?!
okay, let us talk about this.
that is it?
that is how we do it in the paper biz.
i think i know why.
hey, you know what?
you are an angel.
what?
no, it was stupid.
alright.
i just got back from jamaica.
i do not know.
no, no, no!
if you want to just, anything?
okay, phyllis.
aha!
you heard anything yet?
my god, these could be tracings!
another day.
or we just go for the loft.
personal hero, cool new guy.
no!
i love working at dunder mifflin, a division of taliban enterprises.
so let us just do this.
i will have to call her back.
you think that is good?
darryl said i could use the bailer because I am leaving.
i want you to go down to the mall.
whatta we got?
i saw your-your sign outside.
listen listen listen listen listen listen.
run!
son of a bitch.
okay okay okay.
hey, carla?
this is like the blair witch hunt project.
i am going to embrace oscar.
real, real bad people.
oh!
stop.
I am public speaking.
i do not... okay, okay okay.
deck the halls with crappy gifts... yeah, except for cheating on your wife.
your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again.
my main concern, should i have a safe word?
i am totally serious.
which will be fine.
i cannot believe this, you are sending packer to florida?
m-m-munchies.
life.
they deserve the right to dress as they please.
okay.
eight years.
i am not going to be speaking with him anymore.
when michael was denied a room at the inn, we do not know what happens because that story has not been told yet.
i will call you when it is time.
go.
phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.
no touching.
let us go to the zone!
oh.
i lost ed truck.
this is about a very cool hr initiative that if we do not follow, we are all going to die of obesity.
see what i mean?
i shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
well, it is a suicide mission, you know.
when i needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.
they were engaged, so...  okay, you know what, sir?
he is just being stupid.
double it.
where was my oprah moment?
it is the most personal thing in the world.
i could... what do you mean, "what"?
you got to have some extra space.
no, do not give him... just, did you hear anything i said?
do not comfort... do not comfort her, that is not... she does not need comforting.
that is horrible!
i do not know... yet.
let us play some games.
letter to the editor.
party.
ah, a burro, of course.
would you like to help me with a special project?
like anybody would want an oven mitt.
we are... we are not... we are not doing this today.
okay.
holly... lujah!
no, i had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
so we are leaving early.
the same stuff you get downtown.
beat it!
well, it is a pretty big check.
yeah, nothing.
those things are like ticking time bags.
um, i do not see how that is unprofessional.
what do you race cars?
not so much.
there is a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.
cooper's.
do you mind if i wear that for the photo?
it would be a great icebreaker.
take it away guys.
do not do the squirrel.
and at the end i will reveal, that they were all just one rule.
but it would have ultimately been a disappointment.
the product... the progidal... my son returns.
okay.
at all.
yeah, oh do not say bucks, it is not lady like.
yeah, i shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my mac.
if she was sitting across from you on a train and she was not moving, you might think she was dead.
stop it, stop it!
that many?
oh, umm, ever since i started here, I have kept a diary of all my sales.
come on, stanley!
i understand.
okay.
i do not know, same old stuff.
and there is a special secret prize for the winner!
so be it, then you have lost credibility.
you are okay.
yeah.
I am  against violence in the workplace.
bye.
you are better.
reaching!
i think we should share an awesome blossom, what do you say?
i would like you to go to my mother's house in dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, i want you to boost yourself up, i want you to go down to the basement.
i can not do this by myself people!
my name's michael.
that is all that matters!
oh, well, that is fine.
when i saw him, i would never be able to apologize to him.
look at that!
why is she trying to take stanley from us?
hey, where you guys from?
i have work up to my ears I am busy, busy, busy.
are you kidding me?
you want more?
it is one of my dreams.
oh, god.
what are you talking about?
yes.
hey!
oh, my god!
i climb off, walk around the corner... ta-freakin'-da!
oh, every man's dream.
a big office party i need to go to, so...  can not get out of it.
remember the 15-scooper we had last week?
hey!
he is in his knickers.
yes michael scott for dr. jocelyn, please.
stat.
you set me up.
thanks a lot, man.
you are great.
come on.
your job.
roasted.
i am sending you some email.
i wrote "bringing someone to the hospital".
so that should tell you something.
... and... we had sex, too.
that - it is, it is more of a disco.
your proctologist.
our town car awaits.
and sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.
take heed of.
well, i can not afford it, and corporate will not pay for it.
what is wrong with you?
you know what?
two whistleblowers... two!
filing?
oh, man.
hello, how are you?
hell, yeah.
you are cheating.
tell me what they are.
um hmm.
this is perfect.
mm.
i got it made in the shade.
no, it is alright.
do not talk to me that way please.
yes we will see oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities!
whoa.
to the michael scott paper company!
you have not made a sale.
that would be fun.
here comes stanley, with three hot dogs!
a, that is what she said, and b, i wanted it to be impressive.
no, i did not.
ratting somebody out.
who is that guy?
you are going to h-e-l-l double hockey sticks.
just, okay.
let us go on a little walk.
it is just... brrrrrr... it is "amazing race," phyllis.
did you see a big package?
all right.
or, as i like to put it, my family is doubling in size.
shut it, shut it, shut it.
you too.
are you sure you are doing that right?
makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
the next time you see me, I will be working for corporate.
not on oscar's head.
well, let us... come on!
some great articles in that.
got to keep the troops entertained.
so i need a little treat for the gang.
really makes you wonder how ben franklin can become president, but someone like elizabeth can not.
i know, i know, we will wait.
listen man, i am completely over jan, so, would you set me up?
after all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
one, two, three.. ok. ok. how 'bout this?
mm?
who else?
guys, get on this.
you knew i liked her and you just sent her away.
i need more time.
and fourth, getting presents.
right there.
no.
i have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.
well you guys should hit the road before... i close down another branch.
i could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you would better shake my hand right now.
that is how it works.
give some to oscar.
um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost.
you know what we need?
who is he calling?
alright, ciao.
bye.
expenses.
hi donna.
alright, i would like to cancel my reservation, please.
i ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so i would like eight pizzas for half-off.
just pretend we are not here.
and it is making them all angry.
what?
why do not we just warm up first?
they do not have copiers.
holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since world war ii.
you are the fifth person to tell me that today.
and then michael scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
i come in here to release frustration.
ahh, that is mine.
so.
no.
he really respected the manager.
people are really diving into their characters.
waves over jamaica, $6.99.
uh, you are not going.
oh!
jim halpert is smudge and arrogant.
come on, get back to the slums.
but i love burlington coat factory.
that is the problem.
well, yeah... it worked.
boink!
all right, we will have a motivational dance contest!
ah, ok. what is it?
the office is yours.
you got it?
my bad.
the kids do not want to hear some wierdo book that your nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
he would sing.
why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
that was great.
i saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
this is tito.
just a notch above toby.
i just got back from vacation, mon, all right?
i suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus.
come on.
you are black, stanley!
come on.
anything you guys want.
it is not going to solve anything.
but it is fun.
yeah?
no, no you are not going anywhere.
jan, this program is going to change people's lives.
guy had no sense of humor about it.
dwight, no.
replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold.
ok.  he is back!
i do.
um, so, let us, uh, just read some of these suckers.
no seriously.
and i will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it.
dwight, let jim do that, please.
okay.
maybe she hit me.
she is my ex-lover!
do not know, do not care.
vamoose, pam.
i am.
who is there?
about talking to the press?
I am ryan, and tonight did not go the way that i thought it would, because it did not work out for me, and I am very embarrassed.
i want you to go and get a real tree.
what was on that?
here we go.
nice to meet you.
we are moving to colorado.
okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.
he is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend.
no it is not.
this is good.
dwight come here.
there she sat.
do it!
i did not even invite you to my birthday party.
erin, what about my keyboard?
talk about you know who.
I am already on it.
go to your room.
hey, what is going on?
mm, no... $645.
why would anybody find that offensive?
well, i guess this is as far as i can take you guys.
are you sure?
um, couple of months ago, dwight tried to go behind my back with jan and get my job and i am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
nobody's after me, i just, i met a woman when i was giving blood and i thought she might come by.
i had to tell him.
i want you guys to run it.
we are never going to find those leads, are we?
hi.
what if she brought her "partner" in to work?
oh, i wish you were here last year.
never.
in this dream i did both of these jobs beautifully, and i loved it, and everybody loved me.
amicably.
you are 58 years old?
oh do you?
so the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
we are going to open a six pack of whoopass.
did you know that?
that is our only option.
yes.
i think, wow, i love my big brother.
nope.
captain jack sparrow, jim.
on our own.
well it is funny that you should ask, because it is really more than a company... dammit, oscar!
i mean, god.
icing on the cake.
you know what, it was not just me.
alright.
that is how it works.
because this is  really good, this is really good.
i mean, seriously.
remember?
everyone for himself.
you know what, i can dial 411, get jim's number.
and karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you do not already have one.
put it down.
hey, stanley, in case i do not see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash.
james freakin' bond.
if the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we would be done .
dwight, find out what the present is.
what is going on?
god!
it hurts my arms.
oh coffee, that is too much.
let us move that up.
excuse me.
everybody has to go to the bathroom.
then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.
no, I am not.
excellent, excellent.
i mix newman's ranch with newman's italian.
c'mon, we are going to asian hooters.
there is nothing she can do to stop it now.
it happened this morning in the parking lot.
i have opened a box, which should not have been opened... and distributed things which should not have been distributed.
so we can do this again.
phyllis is santa?
good work, stanley.
oh, wow.
a christmas carol.
like i was watching cinemax last weekend.
magazines and tv shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses.
tobee-yy!
opportunity, promotion, blah, blah.
yes.
when in rome.
bagel bites or something.
you are almost there.
messages?
why do not you walk away from the room, 'kay?
thank you.
could you send her in?
nailed the joke.
town cars are actually better, though.
aaaahh!
stay where you are.
dwight-elicious.
la la la, hello oscar!
techno-babble.
so shoot for the stars, ok?
maybe you will give more than three dollars next time.
i hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "uh... no.
sucker!
I am in no rush.
no, I am serious, we do not have to put up... is it the dogs?
major personnel crises averted.
i think i have a frog in my throat.
she goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in malibu.
take one, take one.
guests only.
mo money mo problems, stanley.
not important.
i do not want her to get away.
hey, hey, hey.
because i would kick his ass.
well, it is, like, well, it is, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that is... exactly, thank you.
probably get soup or something light.
what are those?
sure.
do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen?
I will call david.
the bad man is gone.charles is gone.
i can not... ryan, come on.
thank you.
I am not going to date a 55-year-old woman.
i love  them.
I am sorry, man.
everybody'd go.
ryan, cut!
since i pay her salary it is like I am paying for the wedding.
no, no.
I would like everybody's attention.
what have we learned?
like you are applying for a loan.
you know what?
god!
that is a serious offense.
really?
and now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
you have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are going to concede.
and I am glad i did.
what?

jesus christ, his son.
okay, yeah, why do not you go get it?
hey.
okay, you know what toby?
who opened the morgue for this thing?
you know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, i have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so i think we should pull the trigger and - all right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
with a rep from hammermill.
yeah.
surprise!
hello, holly.
wow, what a day!
i hear voices, is somebody there?
let us see josh replace these people.

they punk'd us!
first i was afraid, i was petrified.
when i think about all the time i wasted being your friend - i should not have been hanging out watching karate movies with you - you know what, i should have been doing?
is she ok?
it is about you.
if luck were not involved, i would always be winning.
just life- and doing things- before you die.
okay, this is it.
... right?
okay.
I am in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton, pennsylvania but I am also the founder of diversity tomorrow, because today is almost over.

holly.
that is crooked on that side.
your boss is nice!
you did not do that.

i will go to my room.

i questioned myself.
the next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.

hello?
jim and dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.

you ever been to scranton, jan?
that is a good idea.
okay, here is a tough decision for you.
because you have great ideas.
no.
is he why you left?
anyway, i was giving it some thought, and there is no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can not, you know, just... sit down and work this whole meredith thing out.
you do not have to say it like that.
that will resolve this issue.
pleasure to meet you, miss bennett.
it is... a message.

ooh!
first up, the lost and found has gone missing.
great.
a lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally  some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing  some people should not be in this business.
good.
I am not your father.
yes, they are.
he is very very smart, and funny, and charming... you know, i can not do it, toby is the worst.

right?
but, yes.
it is.
meetings.
well, ok, it says here that i learned something and i knew all this stuff already, so... i know, i could sign something that says that i taught something, or that i helped you teach something, so... pam!
what is the problem here?
this is... really amazing.
i am the regional manager of dunder mifflin paper products.
I have seen that movie half a dozen times, and i still do not know who the real spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
oh, wow!
i want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.
good, good, bro.
these are my party-planning beeyatches.
take her to a motel, make love to her jim.

she was so innocent.
I am sorry, but we do not have quitters on this team!
remember?
hey, right?
uncool.
brenda, could jan and i have a moment alone?
jan levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we are going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.

those people will be ruined.
and you know what else we are going to do?
i am not in the wrong here.
we are moving.
oh really?

today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
I am not going to be okay.
no, you are the best person for the job.
can i give you a piece of advice?
hey, what time is it?
mmhmm, I am sorry.
i want it to be like... "hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "um, well, i do not, i do not know.
ok, buddy.
it is because of where we are.
wait a second.
on the street we did not have any rules.
but, you know what?

oh here he is!
i checked the route - there are no potholes.
i will... do not be shy!
i think i will pass.

he is a nobel prize-winning physicist.
dun-der... dun-der.

he is an accountant.
my sales dream team.
it is?
hey, did you come up with toilet buddy?
might as well of been toilet paper.
hi.
nice.
to test the aspect of my job that i think is the most important, something i call the bob hope factor.
and that person is  deangelo!
exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.
here is the rub.
so this is astird.
you should never settle for who you are.
he was not happy at all when i offered him this job and then i told him he did not get the job, so- i do not appreciate you telling me what to do.
i did not put a roof..."  ... we laughed so hard... it was hilarious... oh...  so yes, I am very excited about the diwali party.
umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
okay, all right, i will do that.
yes, well.
this is like when the freshmen would throw a party and would not let any of the seniors go.
wait.
no, baah!
i do not know what streets we have been--  ow!
what are you doing?
do not make fun... you are making fun of me.
that is totally inappropriate.
all right.
hey, what is up.
today will either be the best or the worst day of my life.
i have a roommate, uh, vijay chokalingham, he is a sophomore at queens college.
so that is the problem, is solved.
you know what?
there ya go.
you are so brave.
i do not know whose fault it was.
well fight it out amongst yourselves.
yeah!
think with your head, pam.
ryan, obviously the best.
oh, and I am not?

we make a poster that says "happy opposite day!" and she sees it on the way out... nah, that is stupid.
yep.
just shut up!
oh!
you down with the dundies?
okay, so dwight, in your own words -  "someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons.
in the conference room?
food service.
you can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they have already gotten, like the oven mitt.
uh,  "I will help, elwyn dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword." ok, so, let us put together a starting line-up, shall we?
everybody has a chance!
noooo!
but do not tell anybody that i have anything to do with it because if they ask me, i will say that you are crazy.
and this is not even a cell phone.
no, no, no.
we are going to choose team names.
how about friday?
well, if you like her so much, do not give up.
okay then we are... yes.
no, time out, time out.
that is good.
how you doing?
you know what?
shut up.
brown," he got us halfway there.
oh the rotating um, steam wand.
but this is an emergency because my friend is not here and i am worried that he has been abducted.
just drive faster.
"home alone," "risky business." take your pants off, run around.
did you know that gay used to mean happy?
I will, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.
you feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it is really sad because everybody thinks you are a loser...  stop.
andy bernard.
i would love to live in new york someday.
so i do it.
sounds good.
hmm.. would you excuse me for a second?
you waiting for a call?

toilet sponge.
all of us?
kgb - what the hell was that?

no, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
so... oh, that was the last good item.
wikipedia.
there will be no questions.
oh, god, a mini-van.
no, no dwight.
ryan?
we headed up there, we went to a little chinese bistro, um, p.f.
and... my question to you  is do you agree?
there he goes.
i di- alright, I will take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world i would want to do is upset pam.
i hate looking at your face!
tell me what you really think.
well, ok, you have just committed a felony.
well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism.
very nice.
hello!
jack blaise.</i> by far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie.
we did it.
ow!
so they asked me to give a statement to the press.
catch you guys on the flippity flop.
he is, he is like a really mean-spirited guy.
china has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars.
the type of stuff you guys tell all day.
no big deal.
in an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain.
i thought i found a lump.
i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and i want to show you... there we go!
ah, what?
come on, i mean i do not even know what they do.
sometimes i will just stand here and watch television for hours.
dating should not be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why?
have a seat.
phyllis, angela, karen.
i just wish that josh had made a more progressive choice.
i think we have sort of a bad connection.
alright.
I am not going get a brain- stop it.
so how do you search?
how did you get in your wheelchair?
like the regional manager of the day.
okay.
i can not hear you.
just, okay, just... oh, god.
i do not have an in case.
okay.
internet.
okay, okay.
he swiped the security tape for me and he is bringing it over.
okay, you know what?
how much you paying her?
and i know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office.
we had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why did you have to go off and die?
after breakfast.
oh it is all good, it is all good.
well stanley, maybe you are feeling that you do not respect me because you do not know me very well.
this is where toby announced that he was going to costa rica.
all right.
if I would brought in some burritos or some colored greens.
and that is who i thought he was.
you broke up with aj weeks ago.
you can not have any candy!
we will use the doll.
jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances.
may i have everyone is attention, please?
oh ok. i have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow.
i do not care if he goes and files a report and says that we are nothing special because i think our future is very bright.
long story short: jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer.
phyllis!
where are we here?
you can do this.
anyone but dwight.
you know what, forget it.
hi.
sharing... and tolerance.
i am not going to finish.
now, i know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?" how do you know michael clump?
buenos dias, dwight!
it is just the first... girl that popped into my head.
um, you get it.
I will just go by myself.
because you went with michael scott.
nice to meet you.
high score?
alf, you know, i might have actually been probed by alf.
what do we know about him?
attention all dunder mifflin employees, please.
and i want you to burn this into your brains.
I am going to do it.
umm... yeah.
hello?
your nose?
so, she misses me?
well there is no jumping in a triathlon.
so run with the ball!
can you?
or he said.
this one really smells like vanilla.
nailed him.
that is nice.
oh, shoot.
i will... no... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I will let you know how it goes.
i did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and i just thought you were speaking abnormally.
what if they made out?
alright.
so, the next day he goes back to complain.
brangelina is the brad pitt and angelina... roy... roy and pam.
in our room.
luke is my nephew.
was i saying anything interesting?
today I am headed to philadelphia for the annual northeastern office supply convention.
i have a special assignment for you.
well, is not that nice?
how about that?
but I am the first in the office?
come on, here we go!
ok. ok, ryan, you have darryl.
no.
this is a business trip.
would you care to bang it out over lunch?
i hate them, and based upon what i have seen you all do not quite hate  them as much as i do so you are going to have a drug test, and i am not.
yes.
hey, buddy.
oh, no, my god.
you!
federal and state.
here we are.
awesome.
and i will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it is ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we will do it on my dime.
no, no.
thanks.
but you know what else would have been nice?
oh, so... i almost forgot.
it is lower, so... all right, managing by walking around.
angela.
aspirin's not going to do a damn thing.
i think we are like romeo and juliet.
come on.
to recoup their losses, i am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over scranton can come and bid on our goods and services.
and it is something... darryl what are you doing.
made of real apes.
a statue.
no, you know what we are going to do?
pam.
this is it.
do not look at your card.
all right.
no.
it was hard enough to convince jan to come.
and we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it is deangelo the whole time!
ugh!
not that we are all millionaires.
I am going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
well, it was not him.
he is already paying for himself.
i love this idea, and i fully support you.
alright everybody, you know i kid, you know i kid.
oh, right, those are clues.
he is busy, he will call me back when he is free.
okay, uh, well, one is taken.
but i got all the foot off of it.
m-hmm.
presents are the best way to show someone how much you care.
this is the worst.
well they notice it.
how would i know?
sometimes I will start a sentence, and i do not even know where it is going.
let me ask you this, if i were- pssh, kay.
i take spinning classes three times a month.
is that close enough for you?
it was kind of a slap in the face to realize that i was not as important as i thought i was to a certain young executive who i cared about.
they are unreadable.
you are truly, truly beautiful.
what?
and it fit!
so, it is still an upgrade.
no time!
inspirational.
jack nicholson for birdie.
I have never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
nothing wrong with this stuff.
that is... that is pungent.
pam?
good to see you.
something less offensive?
kevin.
very good.
no, no no.
today i turned an office crisis into a teachable moment.
hey hey!
4:35.  alright, almost made it.
my philosophy is basically this.
the women in my improve class absolutely hate him.
texas!
ok. I am sorry.
there are copies in the bathroom?
this is darryl, one of our warehouse staff.
i did it.
ahhh!!
no, january  I have never asked for a raise in 14 years.
it will probably be on a boat.
if it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.
okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so i guess i will just go play some online scrabble.
you heard me, pack your things.
it will help, man.
ohh.
but it is not... going to take... a week or two.
I am going to go back in.
okay.
get whatever you want.
i owe you...a most sincere and humble apology.
it is so much fun.
oh hey, i know you... elizabeth?
my real beef with her, though, pam?
adultery's a sin, look it up in the bible people.
oh, oh, i take umbrage to that premise...ses.
his bed, it--  and i am not going to tell them that I will be reading their e-mails.
I will tell you.
hey, well, we have time!
shhh!
i should go, and start my own paper company.
you never expect that you are the killer... it is uh... great twist.
um, let us see.
hi, jan!
... that i would have made.
well, no, not trying to fit in.
i did not want everybody to know what it was.
no!
wow.
congratulations.
dwight, do you have the box?
so this is his strike two.
spoiler alert: I am going to win.
i know.
ohh... kay.
howard, like moe howard.
wow.
two queens on casino night.
why do not you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
so older people have just as many rights as younger people?
it is really long.
do not be shy.
how come chris rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then i go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to corporate?
corporate shut down the buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.
it was an accident.
no.
now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
but, we have to try and that is why i created the integration celebration.
which is why i have modeled all my games after survivor.
really?
uh huh.
so, um, one of the clock sharp and we have got a game on.
out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than i have, or manages more people?
i read in one of those books that you are not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.
it used to brighten my morning.
here we go!
could i stick it with a pin?
the warehouse world.
nothing he is doing is cheering me up.
now, jim is going to be the client.
okay?
that person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail.
and i do not care about nobody!
that would suck.
do not, oh... this is egregious!
or the funny things that they can do, like "where is the beef?"   yeah.
stop, stop!
so we have about an hour and a half.
it is a real bitch.
everyone!
alright... oh!
whass...up!
first hand up.
I am fine, weirdo.
let us do it.
formally known as toilet guard?
which brings me to my main point and that is that i will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.
okay.
as you know, we are six days away from phyllis' wedding.
welcome to the roast of mr. michael scott.
mm-hmm.
get up here, dwight.
um, and 788 not yet replieds.
and if they do... sign me up... because i am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
there is, as a matter of fact.
hello  you are about five hours early to the party.
yeah.
I am going to start the bidding, because this is something that i have dreamt of- okay.
i do.
is it a collection of numbers and sales reports?
aw, come on!
let me rephrase that.
you can not help anybody.
take me to your leader.
i can not believe I am going to say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost.
you know what i am talking about.
red heads.
hey right, i have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
okay, you heard something.
i did, yes!
i think they were stolen.
so... i know.
going to head out.
it is not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it is not even a scheme per se, it is...  ... i have to go make a call.
um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, that is shizzle.' okay.
happy halloween.
black tie optional.
no office romances.
so I am not in trouble?
it is not true.
ha ha!
bickering!
...and then i think I am going to go to the garlic festival.
get up there.
jim.
you have a stockholder meeting coming up and you are going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.
new attitudes about handicap people.
so, maybe you should come back.
what is there to like?
when corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer holly back to her old branch, in nashua, new hampshire.
carol?
oh, ok. what is that, like, a video game?
two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I have ever seen in my life.
just get in here!
you can say it as loudly as you want, but we are not going to believe you.
sales.
i am goateeless.
it was a crime of passion, jan, not a disgruntled employee.
pam.
i just... i miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it.
mmmhmmm.
i do not want to die!
i got it!
this order form.
ok. alright.
I am going to see your play.
so... ah!
macgruberrrr!
let us do it.
in that box!
where is creed?
pam, really, what is it?
guys, beef!
he was my accomplice.
i want you to get her to be in this commercial.
yes, i did, for you, princess.
jim is her husband.
it is a heart.
justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she is hot!
yes.
it is an advice question, and if you do not want to talk about it, i completely understand.
i love you.
great job.
here we go!
no.
do not do that.
i got it.
and to king angela!
okay, okay.
stop spraying!
goooood morning, viet-nashua!
parkour!

I am going to read you a series of statements, and i want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.

how was it?
look at that.
i think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
the guy who had my job has died.

thank you.
it was <i>so</i> good.

I am thirsty, mama!

we are going to make everything all right.
oh, hey.
he is a great accountant.
'golden ticket.' no.
you sabotaged me, man!
ahh!
how many times have i told you?
having luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. the last time i saw luke was the opening day of 'ace ventura ii' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot.
well, he may not be here.
I will help.
well... i swallowed all your ideas, I am going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
i have a company to run.
ok.  well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.

what are my options here?
I am going to have it one of these nights.

you are seeing how the sausage gets made.
let me ask you something.
your life.

if you are ryan's parents or pam's parents or my parents, you do.
how is the workload on all of dwight's old accounts?
all right.
i think you guys are two metals.
we did.
michael scott.
okay.
no, not at all.
and the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.

this is none of your affair because she is your boss- and she is a woman.
nobody likes to work late, least of all me.
is that on the water?
so, what can i do you for?
i think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
there is not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
come on!
i do not think... i love it!

I am going to give myself a pat on the back.
thank you, mr. springsteen.
pam.
yeah.
good attitude, hottest in the office.
no, it is not.
you are not faggie.
the judge is in session.
and you know what, stanley?
i mean, i have a yacht, so i obviously did pretty well money wise.
and everyone, whatever hank decides, that is the decision.
i was in love with you.
so that is how it ends.
i have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before i get dressed i will tuck myself between my legs just to see.
we did?

I am improvising, so just try to keep up.
yeah, do it!
right?
you are going to drive me crazy.
so, i forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this... one other thing i wanted to... ohh...nah.
yeah.
jim, it is not the horniness, ok it is the loneliness that... let us go to new york.
ugh... that is a long story.
right.
I am not a master bee.
i have some news.
ok. i think that i have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
oh, i am in my office.
you cannot learn from books.
no inconvenience.
all good.
i do not need your help!
oh my god.
that is the magician's code.
i do not know if i can do that.
yeah.
I am not in this for the trophies, but... well, technically, I am a co-manager, and i barely have any responsibilities, but i work hard, i love this company, and for those reasons, i think i would make a good employee of the month.
stat.
it is a big cheque.
oh!
you called me and you were really angry at me and i got scared, so i had dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it is a great idea and dwight will not confess.
no problem.
I am going to do it now.
i have the long sleeve.
to retrieve... i left my cell phone here.
...where did you get that information.
gah.
well, kids today have a very short attention span.
what is jim capable of... or pam... or kevin?
i see your voice in the phone.

he came to me, and said, "mr.
let us go.
well they are wrong.
well, i just got off the phone with january  and um... she demoted me.
alright, next suggestion.
he made a better paper airplane, stamford is better in sales... i get it.
ha ha ha.
up in the...  he does not even get to play in the game, i mean.
ok, that is fine.
come on, man.
well, ben franklin, you are really kind of a sleezebag.
you know, let us just... okay.
he is making her sell to him.
depression is a very serious illness.
thought you had gone home already.
could i be a part of the meeting also?
i know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless.
hi dwight.
oh, man!
where is andy?
take a gander.
you do not have to display that.
mmm-hmm.
so... oh, stanley kaplan!
i think they are very excited about paying their respects this way.
holly has to go back to colorado.
i work with a bunch of nerds.
home, sweet home.
oh, really?
i can do this.
psych!
and then i had to ride up here with stupid toby.
so officially, i did not see her.
leave me al- saving him!
i am exclusively big picture, epic.
hi.
or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
this office is cursed.
nearby?
answer, the question.
wish i could have gone with ryan on that cool retreat!
you notice it.
i can not believe I am actually doing this!
what a horrible day.
well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for pda here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best valentine's day present that a person could receive.
mmmmmm.
toby, can i really tell you anything?
well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we will stop.
next round of drinks is on me, people!
who quits?
so, i am going to... give her a ride home.
by yourself?
allergies?
but you can not just go right to the selling, you need "small talk."  what topics can you use for small talk?
i am going to google sulfur maps.
I will tell you what is going on.
wha?
well, i hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at dunder mifflin, scranton.
no.
pam, say hi.
you just made an enemy with the wrong guy, dwight.
the lady jan levinson wanted to go to montego bay.
alright!
okay, we do not have to volunteer.
get a nice bra.
i... okay, yeah, that is pretty hot.
hello?
yeah.
oh my god.
toby is leading ours upstairs.
obviously george clooney.
this feels like you never left.
why do i have to explain everything?
i can already feel people's stress starting to melt.
you know what?
there are ten rules of business that you need to learn.
ok. fine.
here i am using it.
you would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
mmm.
oh, you know, i seem to remember that santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for christmas.
what would you like for christmas little boy?
what?
presenting deangelo vickers!
ready?
i will take care of that.
kay.
but i had to start somewhere.

it is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if i fall asleep, i still end up at home.
booty call.
do not whine.
alright, everybody out except phyllis.
i love you guys, so much.
and, so he is like "what do i do?
what part of shorn't do not you understand, kevin?
i get it, i get it, i get it.
I am just kidding.
bathroom.
not offensive, because that is the way they talk in movies.
ok. i love it.
okay.
did you, or did you not get sue grafton?
see?
gotcha.
300 going twice.
my heart soars with the eagles nest.
oil can.
ok!
no no, I will help you.
i realize that.
oh.
alright.
this is the reason we are here.
yeah?
hey jim, jim.
whether you are scared of dying, or dying alone, or dying drunk in a ditch.
anything?
i thought you were not supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you have had a crown put in.
alright, how about the phyllis/angela dispute?
summer or winter?
how are you?
justin, I am willing to commit right now.
i did, so... calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend.
are you going to believe that?
and three,  you should know that some people think it is cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of burlington coat factory.
it is... that is... okay.
put 'er there.
yeah.
yeah, well, you know what?
thank you.
alright alright, okay, you know what?
no seriously.
stanley?
could you just let me...  every time... every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  i take care of my kid!
you are a guy... too... sort of.
happy halloween, jerk!
i never got closure with her.
your the only one i trust." no thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble.
no.
and they know how to party.
come on.
um... no, no, no, no, no.
i am trying to make your kids respect you.
phyllis!
it could be a lookie-loo.
like twins.
long time!
so this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see.
i love it!
come on!
i need your urine.
probably not.
i am truly impressed.
oooh, okay.
and why do not you take a couple hours.
apricot.
in our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything.
stop spraying me!
get off, get off.
a week?
watch this, if i had money problems, would i do this?
your quarterlies look very good.
imagine if you had left stevie wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
yeah.
that is it.
there are other choices, there is information that we - are you kidding me?
it is a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet?
happy!
huh-  does she ever talk about me?
oh, hey, do you still work here?
roy?
it just goes to show, you leave scranton, exciting things can happen.
we were not expecting you!
oh, god!
pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
in case... in case of what?
yeah!
we are not done here.
so you have to get home to wash your sheets  because they are yellow and they are wet with your urine.
uhhgh.
the uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version.
good.
well, if that is what i am required to do, i will do exactly that.
that is good.
okay, you know what that is?
tube city, you owe me one.
were you going to tell me that you hired james van der beek?
it looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation.
cruise control.
so get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.
yeah, it is... freaking cold out here.
she is really nice.
just clean out your desk!
be that as it may, i have your meatball parm sandwich here, and i am going to eat it.
ah, jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the dundies.
it is just that you say it is going to cost what it costs-- put him through.
just -just back off!
relationships, we do not need no stinking relationships.
so... you know, it is really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
and uh... do you have anything to say to me?
not you.
just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth.
tomorrow I will be back.
he died alone.
phyllis, what are you doing?
that is reverse nepotism.
where does he live, guys?

bloods?
um, no, no.
well, okay, let us go.
kelly?
can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
ok. good.
no, no, i can do this.
yeah, well, i was told that holly would be here, single and ready to date.
good to see you!
hello.
each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you.
you know what this is?
oooh!
wish i could, but i can not.
i have donna.
good to see you.
why would dwight do that for you?
nice!
uh, i wanted-- i wanted to buy some weed?
you put the tv here, you put the family over here.
yeah, looks like everyone is tightening their belts in this economy.
i really appreciate it.
do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?
i trust him.
okay.
wow.
except dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
we do not want any of this kind in here.
i guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you do not.
talk like you are talking to that race.
you know, there is no controlling it.
I am not asking the temp for an extension unless i really need it.
i lied to kevin.
i think I am going to run out of gas.
oh, this was such a stupid idea!
you know what my favorite season is?
I will talk to you tomorrow.
thirty-one!
yeah!
i love you, january what a weird day.
"why are you helping her?
see, that is what christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, "man, i wish i got that." i mean, that is just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else.
okay.
then i will call david wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
hey, hey, hey, not funny!
a siesta!
oh.
some panties or... pick a thong or... g-string.
meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory.
i know all that.
please?
we have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
no, i thought I would be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo.
oh god!
yes, thank you.
he was, but, uh... that desk was empty.
what?
i do not need to be friends with pam.
yeah.
we do not need new chairs.
look at him.
this is what I would do.
i guess we are back to normal.
what is meredith's problem?
and another thing about the indian people... they love sex positions.
heard you a little bit less that time.
oh ho, oh, he is running.
must be kind of neat comin' back.
the day he grows hair.
well, oscar, if you do not like it, then you should concentrate on winning.
wow, that sounds so... warm.
deangelo, i was just telling them about last night, when we met.
argh.
okay.
on you mark.
come to me, necropolis.
yeah, you took it too slow.
oh!
that is what you are feeling.
phyllis, did you get the live storks?
that is funny!
i think everybody likes ice-cream cake.
scranton power.
yes.
because i will.
so much in fact, that i would like you to accompany me on a trip to sandals, jamaica.
hmm.
let us get right down to it.
blonde hair, nice boobs.
oh.
uh, well, honestly ed, i really do not want to be up there right now.
no.
but sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that are not dentist appointments.
what you and jim have times 100. just she... she just left.
maybe you should have won the kind of a bitch award.
you are not stupid.
I am sort of a student of comedy.
and a chihuahua.
so... i may need to fill out one of those love documents again.
this is an opportunity.
bring the papers, I will sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
i like the musical "grease", or as we call it, "home".
hi.
another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
game over.
oh, you know what that is!
but you know what?
um.
the whole time.
you are.
ok. fine.
road trip!
post-show blues?
mm-hm.
um, i just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I am sorry.
where you rushin' off to?
that is why it is a joke.
i will talk alright.
but it is hard for you!
no, rose.
thank you for the permission.
because a real relationship, it... it can not be forced.
i think i do.
i would not miss it for the world.
i know, i know.
in italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.
ryan, ryan, we are going to take your clothes off.
i will get my purse.
i had rebound?
he is invincible.
mmmm... you know what i really, really miss about college?
today is a very special day for me.
about what?
why did not you just say that, pam?
d'oh!
ok, umm, i think, that is either the hudson or the east, so we are back,  should be back this way.
assistant to the regional manager dwight.
tonight, i can not do it tonight, no.
the dog or a fish?
no, that is not... i do not know what that is.
yeah, i asked for pickles with my burger.
see you monday.
uh, nine.
I have got gas all over my hands and my shoes.
no.
what do you want me to do about it?
are you mental?
you could work on the way here.
you did!
pam.
i will go last.
ok. well.
con- you unzip your pants, and you find that there is a calculator down there.
it is a secret.
can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
at all.
you like coal mines and you want to see  them, well, check it out, yo, the anthracite museum!
fantastic!
yeah.
she just knows that she is turned on.
not on angela's boob.
well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
that was packer!
it is.
i wonder what it was going to say?
no, he did not go behind my back.
okay, well, let us... .
this is so, so stupid.
i swear phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at dunder mifflin.
he is a math whiz.
no!
and maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night.
makin' progress.
hello, gabe.
hi.
is that all you have to say to me?
dwight, can you get those please?
i hate you!
and it is just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
good.
so i would say that the old boss has always been good to dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs.
where you from?
and you have made my life so much easier in that i am going to have to let you go first.
funny story: the way that i got into improv was, i got into improv.
here we go.
all right, let us start.
we have a lot of fun.
he is going to absolutely freak.
since when is comfort the most important thing?
anybody?
it does not matter.
any questions?
i know all that.
no body go in.
I have never been a big fan of the name dunder mifflin.
dwight, you have hit a new low here.
because that is what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed.
now, what are our choices right now?
satisfied?
stop it!
oh, hey mon!
why does she do that?
you know what?
yayyy, and let the show begin!
you will notice i did not have anybody be an arab.
they sent a limo.
but also upper middle management.
five pounds.
but sometimes twos can be wild.
erin, can you give us a second?
yeah, .
i ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than i have in my entire life.
ya done good kid, ya done good.
let us round it up.
they are like women that way.
but we need money coming in every week.
okay, this is it.
what you might want to do is kind of a papa bear, mama bear, baby bear thing.
ditto.
come-on... come on, come on.
and earlier today, i was freaking out.
hey.
well, I am texting him, so.
all right you know what?
this car is an investment.
this is great.
any of them?
what is this?
one here at the lipophedrazone diet pill company-- and the other i was a regional manager of a small paper supply company called dunder mifflin.
well, so far, i think it is killin'.
on paper at least.
bear with me.
no?
gahh, i will pull this car over!
i am about to give blood.
here is what we are going to do.
eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of when the saints go marching in that would blow your freaking mind.
we are not mad, we are just disappointed.
ryan is book smart.
yes.
he does not need to sit, he is a traveling salesman.
we need to reopen this case.
just, you know we  bumped into each and you said, "brr, brr." and i went, "argh, argh." you know?
excuse me, boob enhancement.
you are correct, sir!
i got one.
no, slide-- slide it, yes.
toby's going to fix you up.
call one of the higher-ups?
give it to me dwight.
so corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller... operating blahdy blahdy blah.
packster.
what?
except driving.
okay, sorry.
dwight, dude, you got to take a chill pill, man.
this does not seem like a very big operation.
that is... i, i think that... ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening.
no, they are with me, so... this is nick figaro, manager to the stars!
did she say what it is about?
okay.
it is reversible, i think.
i... what a great guy.
how did they get al roker to come?" yes you can.
i believe i work with your wife, ex-wife, january yeah, that is right, yes.
leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door.
jim is like big bird.
as the receptionist, pam is truly the gateway to our world.
i could have paid for the pizza.
uh, spock, are there any signs of life down there?
pun.
maybe I am having an affair with suzanne summers.
i would have never called him that if i knew.
oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?
all right.
come on guys.
i am off!
okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?
i know i do.
do not.
it is not even lunch yet.
[starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
do not like that.
here ya go.
i will fix this.
you know what?
it is a relief.
yes, i can see... that we did indeed.
this is closing on a condo, it is completely personal.
okay, alright.
i, um, I am out the door.
your problem now, captain jack.
stop!
you know what i might do, i might make this into a kids' room.
the limo seats eight.
really loud.
ed truck was the manager before me.
they are treated like human beings.
really?
and the "tight ass" award goes to angela.
did you see it?
come on, big guy.
cookie.
i just want what is best for you, mo chuisle.
look out your left hand window and you will see vance refrigeration.
who is got roy?
just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to pam and jim, then so be it.
remember her?
that is a toboggan, you never know when you are going to find a snowy hill so... every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and pam is my hot roadie.
all right.
god!
who thought it would be hysterical to give toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
i mean, is this... two bowls of m&amp;ms and some balloons?
it just does not work.
like for tax purposes.
I am an early bird, and I am a night owl.
every year!
what?
check one more time.
and it was not hilarious.
it is just sex.
okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
ah, okay.
holdin' down the fort.
thank you for your honesty.
took about an hour.
kind of sorta an oaky afterbirth.
that is what this is all about.
well, it was not much of a fight, actually.
when a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.
yeah, we locked him up for two years.
yep.
see, i used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types.
you know?
let us-all right, all right.
no.
i have not thought about you having to go back to nashua.
i love your daughter, and i have for some time.
we are totally alone.
do i look like i am joking?
the problem is the chicks.
i think i am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
that is right!
i know what we are going to do.
I have never- i do not know him.
fine, have your clients.
very much.
me on the other hand, i would be lost without this place.
all right.
not directly, but through the money.
take it easy.
hot, tasty.
it is be-because i hate him.
and i want you to know that anything and everything can be said.
good.
what do you... well, you said good luck to jim as he walked in.
jim.
yeah!
I am going to kill myself.
jim, could you come in here please?
why do not i introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
okay?
another time, packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute.
you can not see.
holly flax from the nashua branch.
you have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they are not scared when the dentist comes in.
we have 15 minutes.
but, "it is fun to stay at the -" "it is fun to stay at the -" mmm, mm mm mm.
you call that a sales call?
you do not have one single girlfriend?
you are kidding me?
I will be six.
it is not anything you would have ever done.
we have ryan, the new guy, right?
but i, i still think it is worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
no!
stop it, january no, no, no, means please do not.
he was almost 70.  circle of life.
well, i know a guy.
i came here hoping to meet somebody.
oh, ok... wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second.
ungh, this is not looking good pam!
fine!
thanks for meeting me.
so effective immediately i am promoting you from assistant to the regional manager to assistant regional manager.

this summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches.
okay.
big problems... do not ever change billy.
i could have helped.
who is he?
it is not my fault that you bought a house to impress pam.
he shot himself in the head.
spite her - ok oh, stop it dwight.
i got one.
oh, man.
well, i am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank.
oh... crap.
but real life is not like that.
no.
that is it!
come on.
thank you.
I am not the godfather.
yes.
does want.
we said "surprise." you were, like, "what?" "what the hell's going on here?" good cake.
all right... is that it?
I will tell you what this is like.
home, sweet home.
I am just calling because you responded positively to the-- ...stanley?
yeah, but now his heart is in thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.
i just think a tattoo should mean something, you know?
alright, see if you can guess what this is.
look at you!
what?
kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer.
alright.
oh, wait a second!
swish, swish, swish.

dwight, you are handsome.
yes, that is a good idea.
it is a sign.
or if we box.
no, i have to take it, or it will seem suspicious.
you see how they responded to me?
you know let me give you some money for this.
oh, my gosh, well... listen, oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale.
you and i- you and i are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.

it is a really wonderful moment.
what is up?
yes.
first on the list, let us get you out of the car.

oh, come on.
who is this?
a guy told me about that.
what was that?
it is a generational- sort of gap between us.
is that necessary?
wha - god!
here a woof, there a woof.
no no no no no no no.
wow, i feel like a human juicebox.
angela, your turn.
just get in the car.
i want a price reduction or i am a-walkin.
this is weird.
are you kidding me?
um... i mean did he even see pam?
cheer me up.
say it.
he is the whole package.
why?
you know what?
and i will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
no.
no, um, well i was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?
that sounds great.
because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person i hung out with the most.
fun, right?
woo!
babe-alectable.
such an hr weirdo.
no, I am not.
no, no, no.
pam, pam, thank you madam.

wa-wait, wait, wait, wait.
uh, that is what she said.
guys, guys!
could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?
yeah.
we are all great.
they were so happy down there.
brenda, could jan and i have a moment alone?
the babies that i make with her, will be my children.
this is my toast.
i am the expert.
hi!
they say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because i found out before anybody so I have had more time to be sad.
no... no, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he is just using this roy thing as leverage.
you do not do anything.
that is the danger i found myself in today.
i think i am going to use my complimentary blindfold.
march 4th.
i have an announcement.
and roy.
in high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake.
all right, just say "some toys" please.
i know i would.
hi.
is it midnight yet?
i think you are right.
jimbo.
that is by far the best way to strengthen your core.
well, i think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
so, What are you up to this weekend?
what is that supposed to be?
we call her rice-a-ronnie.
do you remember ed truck?
she said it is the name of a viking princess.
look over there.
newspapers for sale!
i mean, i slave all day and nobody notices me." next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house.
yeah.
we are a law firm.
for any reason, whatsoever.
okay you know what you get?
let us do this.
i have roy.
you know who i really like?
um, how many people are you interviewing?
later guys.
and do your worst.
and besides, i only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and jan, and pam and jim, and angela and andy.
when you catch the ball, i want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then i want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.
um, no.
and elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.
"you need to do something about your coffee breath"- ok. shut up, shut up, shut up, dwight, ok. i do not think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
alright, good.
hello!
hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars.
did he call?
what is this about?
okay.
a fake brother who steals your jeans.
but what is the point?
I am a smart guy.
do not blow it.
i get a call from jan and i meet her at the hospital.
whom, whom... whom?
what is... what is that?
that is just - that is just depressing.
dwight?
so that is it.
but real business is done on paper, okay?
because I am going crazy.
and then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
this one says mel karmazin?
why do not you run them again?
and... i have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly.
here we go, alright got it?
ok, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.
i love it.
people out here do not care about diseases.
you are going to love it.
i hope you are not busy doing something.
okay.
i had those extra wheels on the back...that support you.
sick freak!
you know where you are going?
glee right?
wow.
of-kay.
did you just stagger off the street?
i am not.
no... what happened?
and make it happen.
good for the world.
nothing, other than once again, i am just thankful that i am a paper salesman.
i am on a lecture circuit.
of course it was you.
what do you like pam?
you, way too manly.
you are dropping an a-bomb on me here.
no.
how dare you!
it was not that much.
look at that.
and that is that we are all very lucky to have her here.
could you get to that copy from before?
no, please, please... ok, let us take 15, again.
I am not kidding.
yes.
not like wham-bam-thank ya madam.
hey!
no.
you are better than my best.
good stuff.
oh, was he?
to a happy...  look at those!
from now on, when I am hungry, i am going to eat whatever i am hungry for.
today, jo bennett, the ceo from sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time.
no.
there we go.
yes.
she is got - i do not know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
oh, i dunno about that.
ok. okay.
who is your daddy?
ah, that will not come into this place.
offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it is a good chair.
per mile, yes.
this is not 'lord of the rings'.
no.
what?
and in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and i have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.
a gah-no.
yeah, mon.
i mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.
all right, yes.
just... i want you to think about it, I am starting my own company.
yeah!
also, you.
well, why not?
all of the greek people in the restaurant start screaming "opa!" which means "congratulations," so... I am pretty much devastated.
that leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship.
i do not think anyone heard anything.
things like this do not just die.
oh, agreed, mmm, except... hey hey... what is up chuck?
it is a real turnoff.
definitely.
sort of a guy's night out.
happy birthday!
I am sorry.
handsome, good listeners, funny, mr. wonderful.
what is this meeting about?
the giant baby.
no.
lay them on me.
and do not call it a comeback.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
because i am busy taking you out.
hey, tobes.
oh my god.
happy birthday!
where you going, big guy?
I will call her back.
okay... there he is!
an office is for not dying.
let us get the party started.

oh, god, i hope it is urine.
i was not talking literally, creed.
mr. bill.
kevin, please leave.
and i can be mature about that.
i know, i know, i know.
we are going to learn how a warehouse works.

just, I am fine.
all right, dexter, just give me the knife.
do not, do not.
how are you guys doing?
that, i do not... i do not... ...know if you showed me this same unit or not.

that was your idea dwight.
no.
pudding.

and many more!
cool!
my roommate's friend is the night janitor over there.
right?
buddha this bread for me, will not you?
bfd.
i totally agree with you.
i will get to that definitely.

you are acting inappropriate.
just do not say no.
see how relaxed i am?
if you will excuse me, be right back.
how many pounds is it?
what old days?
ah!
okay.
named for the good times you have when you are in it.
no!
I am just kidding.
boom!
really?
anybody seen something like-lying around?
good.
alright.
i love him.
oh, okay.
well it is a little chillier than i had thought, so i have fashioned my hat back into my pants.
i know.
let us have happy times.
on an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before i leave.
no, no, no.
well... bleh busted.
i do not think he is the best dresser.
oh my god.
god.
so-i know.
and it is, how do you say, a beautiful night-- she is foreign.
that he could turn jan against me?
some people have golf, or relaxing.
sorry, he is very lame.
dwight, not now, we have been robbed.
yeah.
okay.
it is been a rough couple of weeks.
no.
yeah, well, that is not going to happen.
so... yes.
in the basement is a tape labeled 'fundle bundle'.
easy no.
it is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.
well, you can not swim in leather pants.
because, dwight... never lies.
let us go.
he had no sense of humor and i proved him wrong in so many ways.
wow, i do not want to hear... you talk.
all right, all right, I am on a roll.
it is okay, she is cool, she also whistle-blew.
come on!
you should call him!
i practically invented decline.
do not patronize me, pam.
are you?
if you lay a finger... would you look at that?
and i am putting together a little presentation for her.
stop, stop it!
and fries!
there is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman.
and perhaps, some pam-chops, with mint... I am looking for the toy drive box.
and i make my own salad dressing.
yup.
i totally rebounded.
see you in a bit.
absolutely.
very nice.
check it out.
delta burke, i do declare.
yes, it is true.
and I am going to go with my guy, and that is ryan.
are those the customer surveys?
I am going to up the ante a little bit literally.
about being in the driver's seat.
do not ape me.
this could be a signal.
titanic?
okay nutcases, get out of there!
it was in all the papers.
oh my god.
you find it?
i would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
good, it is good.
i think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
and I am telling 'ya, could be in maxim.
boooooo.
yeah!
it takes a big man to admit his mistake and that is what i did.
I am going to kill myself!
god, this is so disgusting.
hey hey.
no, no.
well... we have nothin to talk about, dwight.
it is on tv last night.
this is the guy that beat the computer.
andy.
sometimes we will just meet in the middle.
oh, here we go.
oh no?
and i think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other.
emphasis on the bed.
kevin.
and you and me, that must have been a real train wreck.
and business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.
it does not.
what table should we take?
so, uh, corporate just said that i do not want to... oh, thank you.
dunder mifflin!
you are a thief of joy.
he decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day.
um, I will... i have to think about it.
online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.
you are are <i>not</i>, to see that boy, anymore.
okay, all right.
go ahead, ask me for a raise.
it is a big deal.
we are back.

ok. did everybody get one of these?
well you know what?
how are...  oh!
including me.
and this... is meredith's card.
may i have a moment of your time please?
is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
no.
and without any plot, there is no movie.
but 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if i can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba - really?
the two of us.
all right?
am i scared of getting hit in the face?
that is the problem, that is the problem.
secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything.
we are going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are.
oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because i know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
that is inappropriate, kevin.
hi.
and secondly, phyllis how are those mittens coming?
unfortunately i am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
yeah, tell me about it.
did you explain why?
mmm... okay.
how do you start?
where did that come from?

and besides, who does not tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them?
or, duality of man.
uh, i do not need one.
here we go.

the opposite of that.
no, not a uterus joke dwight.
you may have toby.
alright.

i feel better.
but we zoom back further-- actually i do not get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, i get paid by the year, so... yeah, i know.

everybody in the conference room now.
thank you.
you go talk to him.
come on phyllis.
just hit me.
that is not what you said earlier.
well, we know that toby thinks she will be great.
and the day he sells that business back to dunder mifflin.
um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we will be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.
okay, that is enough.
one, two, three.
i mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion... right.
yes i would.
rock and roll!
it is as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness.
yeah, yeah!
i love it to death.
one day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.

hello.
dwight, that is my joke.
pick up the phone.
a real hoop dreams story you got there.
no, carol.
the office is at a crossroads.
what do you say, jan?
but it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction!
uh... you know what?
that is impossible.
i wished for angela, a heart, and for kelly, a brain.
yes.
to show them that we are not above them.
you are not alone.
and, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law.
have you ever seen this woman?
start pretending to do work."  what a jerk.
i will see you in ten.
you are just lucky that we are at work right now.

oh my god!
you and i have a lot in common.
actually the trip sucked.
no.
yeah.
look, i need your advice on something.
in all seriousness, todd packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch.
not as much as i need a moment alone with you.
how you doing?
oh my god, this is super weird.
it is sad.
really?
you know what?
every year, it is just fun.
your body only has a certain amount.
no one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is toby, why do not you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
kevin, i can not decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke.
i will be honest; the dating has not been going well.
the foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
it was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
ugh.
he is the most... important thing in my life right now.
and i could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.
or try on phyllis' pants.
come in.
no, pam.
smells good.
how big was it?
okay.
mpfh.
I am not going to be able to find my shows.

i will not sell.
she is the devil!
oh hey!
they are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.
to love the ones that you see.
on your mark.
it was eleven years, okay?
you can not say that everything is perfect.
yes, indeed.
the other man.
do you think they should have had open auditions for the band hanson?
he... hey, hey, hey, hey!
ok. questions?
i am not a mind reader, david.
cannot be around carbs today.
looks so tiny in my giant hand now.
my dream was in the right place.
well, pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
oh, my god.
got to see how jamaicans live.
they did not get to me.
pam?
my stomach hurts, so i may be going home early today, but... well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it is probably psychological.
i am no longer your boss.
so... what is that?
seriously, where the hell is dwight?
watch this, here is curly joe.
what?
check it out.
i sorta like the old way.
hey, nobody cares.
so, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
nobody even signed my birthday poster.
and... today the dunder-mifflin infinity website officially launches.
it is, it is kind of unique.
oh my god, oh god!
um, i am sort of a master of distraction.
that is it!
yes.
excuse me, hello.
just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check.
the invalid.
yeah... uh, come in.
because i need to think.
okay I am going to throw up.
I am not going to do it but it is... oh this is a good one.

that is my car.
I am not going to... ok. all right.
it would be like coyote ugly.
should have done this a long time ago.
powerpoint!
okay, see you guys.
it is just a farty dirt patch.
an improversation.
ohh... okay... maybe.
you came up with this idea.
have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses?
i went medieval on his heinie.
jim?
what is going to happen when you come into work and you are dead?
we should head out.
if you do not like it, stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
you did these... freehand?
yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market?
we should go apologize to roy or something.
sir, you are awesome!
forgive me for caring.
i know how many hospitals we have, i know how many schools we have.
all right!
scooperman!
matter of time.
what is our receptionists name?
okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay.
all right!
the eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room.
okay, I am going to have to stop you right there.
and I am optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
could you start that one from the beginning?
hey, justin!
pam, I would like you to meet ronnie.
it is called the wastepaper basket!
but sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.
did you like that?
starting tomorrow, dwight schrute will be running the branch.
radisson just gives out this vibe, "oh, I am doing business at the radisson".
real entertainers, like billy joel.
may i help you?"  smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
not bad!
no, that was... that was legitimate.
ugh, what?
here he is.
pound of fish.
well, toby, i went all-in on the first hand, so does not that tell you that i might have good cards, too?
that is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
i am deducting sixty points from voldemort for false pretenses.
anything here?
what?
because you know what our killer is?
so alike.
and they could all go home early?
okay goodbye, goodbye.
oh please.
excellent!
this is going to turn your life around, ryan.
that sounds like it was hilarious.
okay, field trip's over.
seriously, i do not mind sharing.
no.
come on in.
oh my god!
this is not about me, and that is debatable.
hey, you know what?
it is stupid.
all right?
look since you have the machine up and running, can i just stick my foot, we take a look?
do not turn this into a political thing.
my presence has been requested by  chief financial officer, david wallace.
ok, could someone come and get me please, ryan?
do not.
that is, that is... those are instincts that have been created by media and hype.
no calls.
does not it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
that is a lucky number.
hold on, holly's coming back here?
that is a metaphor i guess.
mmm.
ask stanley about that.
maybe.
because you are beautiful.
i dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice.
here we go.
stanley, how do we combat him?
anything new on youtube?
numismatic.
ok, ok... stanley, your team name?
i know, i know, i know, i would not be offering it if i did not think you could handle it.
you are picking a health care plan.
we have always had good christmas parties here, as you know, but they have never been cool.
thank you for coming in.

good to see you, man.
see ya.
well, jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
hello!
help yourself.
dwight, dwight.
um.
I am getting out of town.
shame on you.
this year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
you embarrassed me.
is that the right answer?
come on, I am sure there is something you need to get off your chest.
someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
that is good.
but now, no.
you are so eff-in' smart.
no!
just like this unappealing fat suit.
oh!
yeah.
i do not know, i do not know.
she is not going to find one driving this thing around.
i hope that this scared you.
hey martin, how is it going?
it is a drug.
you know what?
okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want.
david, how much did this house cost?
but maybe i need to be even approachabler.
yes, that too, but i mean with the audio.
fat halpert.
it can wait.
oh, and another fun thing.

they have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag.
hey hey, fellers.

a boss and a money cruncher.
what i want you to do, is i want you to say: it is showtime.
she is pam's best friend.
yeah.

that is a good show.
look at these people.
and here you go, stanley the manly.
not me, i...  "hello, I am michael.
brain food.

i hate it!
ryan... oh my god.
hey there.
cage match!
hey, dwight.
kick there again, i dare ya.

pam, in the frozen food section, swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.

well, word of advice: unbutton that top button.
yeah, oh, hope not!
we are in a stairwell.
oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women?
yes.
i sure do.
try my googi, googi.
i know this company.

the good news is... they can not fire all of us, right?
oh, slow!
excellent.
to what do i owe this pleasure?
a school for mexicans?
would you mind if i listen to my book on tape?
well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
here is the deal.
sounds great, i just think it is great.
well, first of all, i, uh, just want to warm up a little bit.
who here is been the butt of a joke that has gone too far?
you are doing it.
i am not going to be proposed to in the break room.
your answer to everything is to get divorced.
there is not going to be downsizing, dwight.
almost fell.
it dies.
yes it is a good idea.
what is the matter with you?
i want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me.
i have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.
because i like to know.
having fun?

dwight, it is couples only.
meredith has an e-vite from jim.
hate to break it to you oscar but some of us like boobs.
that is delicious!
my protege ryan is at corporate.
but more than that, i realized that... i could not take a job that would take me away from this place.
oh ryan, i need a girlfriend so bad.
because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
oh, and get this.
you think they have copiers?
wow.
no, I am leo dicaprio!

traitor!

they could be shrinking.
creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
and that is why tonight is so special.
this is no good.
okay, that is called a compromise.
get out of here.
all right, we are starting over.
all, you have to close right now.
that is my joke, damnit dwight.
what is wrong with me today!?
dwight, i want you to look at holly right now.
i realize that we do not have the biggest office.
this is going to be the best christmas ever.
show  them, show  them the other side.
i know me.
good!
i can not help but feel partially responsible.
from my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.
that is why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry.
angela, no!
uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.
toby flenderson, of h.r., has made a sudden reappearance.
i totally lost it, because i was half-baked.
stop it!
oh, thanks.
I am not going to start improv at level one, and i do not think my credits will transfer.
hey, hey... he is not sitting with me either.
feelin' hot, hot, hot!
well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
uh-oh.
or... that is it.
that is why i created the 'integration celebration'.
sleep on the way home.
what, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof?
boner bomb starring jason statham.
it is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you.
like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles.
all right!
"mental" is part of the word, i have underlined it.
they always want credit for something they supposed to do!
wow.
i, i put a mark on her arm.
shhhh.
martiiin.
hey, stanley.

still good.
oh, god!
i want you to update all the emergency contact information.
can you make yourself cry?
that is good.
ok, good.
that guy-remember?
oh, i know your hero.
she is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.
oh, good for you.
here we go.
so, you will?
oh, boy... look at you!
okay, then i want pam back.
because if they say no... no!
we got to do something.
why do not you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them.
it is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
i mean because it is... unknowable.
sure.
you should remember that.
come on!
we are really close.
sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that is always trying to teach people things.
king of the stupid universe?
the bowels of the office.
bam!
well, I will be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.
daddy is meryl streep.
it is just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really do not know scranton, do you?
you are supposed to be in the courthouse.
oh, my god.
come on.
but, i cannot accept, because i have been thinking about it, and i think i want to go back to sales.
i happen to like the hilarious hijinx i get myself into.
zing and pep, see that is those are the kind of words we are looking for.
it was very, very terrifying.
this is a white.
hey.
well, that is a relief.
can we afford to lose email forwards?
your nurse became your girlfriend?
oh, just having to much fun.
good to see you.
I am actually calling because I am in love with her.
mmm hmm.
oh!
forward it like it is hot.
i have been hustled.
so much energy... there are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and i just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
sales on accounting.
check it out.
i can not see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
now, i do not have any money so here is what i would like to do.
i do not know, kind of just for fun.
so, uh, probably the question.
okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
is she here yet?
dwight schrute in the building.
classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game.
new york, new york.
you see, i used to run with a very tough crowd.
okay, go back to the annex.
well, phooey on that.
could you tell  them that?
what about a rabies nurse?
i have no idea.
love triangle.
yeah, i a baby daddy.
nothing but net.
that was hilarious.
yes.
you need somebody who- who understands your references.
shut it.
you know what?
he will return later, but i will not.
i am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
it is wonderful to be the center of attention.
shut... shut it.
they are going great.
I am not asking it.
beautiful.
ah, still early.
because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like kelly in the world.
they invited me to their hospitality suite where i  had free food and it was delicious.
yeah!
uh, alright, next suggestion.
he!
what do i do?
i did not-- i did not interrupt when you were having your presentation.
except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because i have started my very own paper company right here in the building.
everybody can go home.
you could do whatever you want to do.
enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.
yes, i love both of those so much.
whoooo!
i believe you may recognize his face from the billboards.
okay, just give it a shot.
...nightswept.
alright, this is getting hot.
we could call him that.
orange juice is in here.
i... jerks do not deserve to be on pedestals.
are we just going to take it away?
oh, ok. yeah, me too.
what is wrong with you?
first got priorities.
barbara keebis.
jim?!?
she asked me for a ride and so i am going to give her a ride home.
this is my world.
he just, he is always, he is always talking about people behind their backs to me.
all right.
hold on.
no, you are remembering it wrong.
but it is great that you do not, because i am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I am - I will be honest, I am having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of  them.
double napkins.
nice, stanley!
here we go.
this is just like that show 'taxi cab confessions'.
i, i surely do, and do not call me honey.
i bet.
that does not mean anything, those are just words.
i do not even consider myself a part of society.
diwali is a festival of lights.
angela, yes, lend oscar a cup of sugar.
okay.
why quick?
really?
oh, so that is what they are saying?
detective wallace?
what is the name of our town?
burned this last night.
ahh, ok. thanks for the ride.
who is the boy toy?
I am calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
that was terrible.
there is no reason to be scared.
maybe believing in god was the mistake.
hello, mr. buttlicker.
hello january wow, kevin, really?
very nice.
if i can not throw a good party for my employees, then i am a terrible boss.
are we both at the right place?
you did not contribute very much.
but it is his performance report... right here.
it is all about give and take, but mostly it is about pushing each other.
all right.
put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
f and c, doubletime.
it does not have to be that dramatic, jim.
alright, give it up.
although i do look forward to our professional relationship.
they are caveman.
yes.
if there are any left over, you can buy one later.
she is not here, but she gets it.
you guys are getting all of these.
we are good?
i got egg all over my face.
no deal.
but now, at a time tdb, all of the problems will be in the past.
did you check its breathing?
let us... be... rational... here.
so much for sex without consequences.
oh, i think it is going to work out great.
and i... okay.
ah, yes!
jim!
yeah, oh, hey.
okay, that is it.
i think it is only fair that you tell me exactly what i did wrong.
yes pleeeeease!
that is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!
sorry, i do not have time for this right now.
where we can crank it!
but there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that i now must teach them.
look kids, your daddy left that face hole..." i dunno, it is a good feeling.
guys, guys!
and i look forward to speaking.
please.
i know!
no.
you sold us all on andy, a product that nobody wanted.
okay, okay, jim.
oh, cr..., oh, god.
and then you lied to my face.
okay, all right.
i wish i could understand you.
so think about it.
see, i thrive on this.
I am a man in my mid-40s and i still get zits.
are you a 12-year-old girl?
it is her back.
pretend that your jobs depend on it.
i lost my train of thought.
man.
she treated me poorly.
so... what are you doing?
swap maybe?
toby's divorced.
hey, pam, how bout something like that for you.

it is enormous, but it is got wheels.
can i have a word with you, jim?
why not?
ski-sons greetings.
get in the cards!
hey, did you catch that up at lake wallenpaupack?
no, dwight.
oh, hey, hey, no, do not run.
okay, i got it.
follow me to your desk.
what?
well, that is really not the way i roll, because sometimes I am in the zone, and sometimes I am in the zoning out.
I am not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with.
when i was in charge, this place was like dave and buster's people just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps.
guys, I am not the only one who is driven the forklift.
oh, i hate monkeys.
okay!
i do not know how they did it.
got to watch those carbs.
mornin'.

I am sorry, I am sorry this guy's a temp and i should have told you that.
alright.
and i would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.

so do, um, do sad, do the sad face.
guys have been...  glasses, turban, ear hair, fatty 3, shorts, fatty 2, lozenge, and fatso.
that is not how you go camping.
and if that is not poetic justice, i do not know what is.
yeah, you are right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?
david wallace would know what to do.
holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
idiot.
now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer.
lots of e-mails to amazon, lots of wasted computer space.

let us think this through.
field trip.
that is over several months, ryan.
by now you are probably sick of hearing about dunder mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.
actually... i have a bunch of these, good ones, that i did not use.
shirty, mole, lazy eye, mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman.
if these walls could tale they would say, " this is a magical place!

okay, just summarize.
good for you.
jim?

this is a stinger.
give me the phone.
ok fine, ignore me.
... probably the funny way.
it is a booze cruise!
okay.
no it is not, not like penis-wise.
all i can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
no, kevin does not have an elephant heart.
I am sorry about that.
oh, no.
you people need to educate yourselves.
that is what I am talking about!
oh shoot!
post-its.

wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, jan-- hey!
oh it... sounded interesting... what you were going to... yeah.
no, no, no, no.
and i got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star.
did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
mmm, yeah.
yeah?
I am going to read it.
how?
I am actually kind of po'd.
the point is, they are not unhappy anymore.
that is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class.
maybe.
give me, you guys... creed give me the ball!
nope.
people like waving, waving sells.
we are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.
i just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving pda or public displays of affection.
well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
hey, jim, jim - where, where do i find the black pearl?
ok, i have an announcement.
okay, so.
whoo!
okay.
you like cosmos?
i will improvise.
just wanted to talk to you about  jim halpert.
alright.
no, no, no, no, no.
i love it all.
okay, darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture.
because I have got this book called the kama sutra.
alright.
take it away.
i placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with blue cross.
not yet.
um, pam, i have to let somebody go today.
you have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which i hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
alright.
yes, i was the first one out.
and many people consider that to be the paris of northeastern pennsylvania.
would you come with me?
utica is snoozeville, um, albany are the prepsters, nashua, no parking, um, akron is haunted, camden... is in a basement, yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in scranton, we are the cool guys.
you can not tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
come on!
fine.
you know, it would be fun.
we will find some, do not leave the party.
stanley is hilarious.
so maybe we should call.

oh ho ho!
oh... ok. okay, well... all settled, then.
so here he comes, he is coming right in.
there!

well, I am going to wait till the end of the day.
just... try not to be such an idiot.
i have so much work to do, i feel like I am going to blow my brains out.
too bad, anchor!
those glasses are super dark.
why do not you go home, and come back for the party?
is it good to be back.
that is right now.
maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.
you are sure?
it was fine.
come on in!

watch this.
a "michael-idea" folder?
i am not thinking.
ahh... oh thank you.
i do not understand.

and he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita.
her computer crashes with the porn, and then meredith with the accident, and then... sprinkles!
and bingo was his name.
you are old.
and I am really looking forward to working with you.
do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
the athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
hey toby, great to have you back, man.
now you got it.
I am loving it.
and josh is giving the garage to bob vance.
nice to meet you.
oh... ah, i almost choked.
uh... when i was ryan's age, i worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school.
we are all going to bernie's?
that is the way southern people talk.
everybody convinced me that something was up.
this is freaking me out.
nope.
i just do not understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
oh, wow.
kevin?
come on.
cop a squat.

watch this.
ha!
you ever read this?
those are just things.
ahh, legs are sorta giving out.
uh, well, jan did not believe in showing affection, so... sometimes i do not know how to react when a girl touches me.
okay.
that is true.
you got to help me here.
yeah, it is routine.
yeah.
oh, you idiot.
does anyone have any idea what the number one because of death is in this country?
i can do it again.
shhh.
we are all going to go and we are going to have a good time.
hey.
jimbo!
"9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist.
I am reconsidering sending them back anyway.
but that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard.
that is the way you are supposed to do it, idiot.
since when do you care about money?
how do they do this so fast?
dwight, you ignorant slut.
I am going to be down there.
oh my god, oh my god, that was very close.
if anything ever happened to you, i would be very angry at myself for not doing all that i could do.
but you come inside... and it is beautiful.
out.
thank you, andy.
voodoo mama juju... what am i going to do?
and so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought them back to the motel.
here we go.
then I will give you away!
go home, toby.
oh yes.
toby, everybody!
cool.
check out these pants.
it was borderline at best and... and jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I am really sorry.
oh, i think you know why i said that.
i am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it is like to have freedom.
thanks, steve.
what do you think?
jan and i understand each other.
look at how cheap street level rooms are.
there has been a murder.
one of a kind.
I am not taking... I am not taking... wait a second, wait a second, i wrote it down in my diary.
that is the way it is around here.
I would rather die.
really?
um.
yeah.
since I am here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
oscar, you are...  oscar, you are gay.
i thought about playing in the nhl, but, you are on the road so much.
shrek!
well, we do not really do rap sessions.
and it was kind of a morale booster thing.
hey guys.
you guys accomplished something big.
you made this?
and there is no middle ground.
no.
what kind of name is a.j.?
hey.
ok. alright.
ah!
you think i framed you, and you are worried about the taxpayer?
turn it back on.
what?
i say go for the air-tight plan and that is why i am having andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.
ayyyy!
hey.
dwight's going to take care of you.
all right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that is just the way we talk in the clink.
cool.
I am ready to go and I am callin' shotgun.
this is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
tell her i hit a cat.
sorry.
this is genius.
I am been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you are going to throw it all away?
i bet you wish it was ganja.
what is with the shirt?
where do you go?
you have had lobster before, right?
pam's a solid seven.
ok, where is everybody?
what is the... oh, whoa!
hello.
do not... i... yeah, i figured that.
yes, but these are employees, sir.
good.
because it is a big universe, and we are all just little, tiny specks of dust.
you know what?
toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.
it is good to see you.
but, frankly, I am a little appalled that none of you know very much about indian culture.
I am holding it together.
what could possibly be wrong?
all right, just relax, keep your pants on.
it does not sound so great, does it?
catch you guys-  catch you guys on the filippity flip.
heading over to poor richard's?
and the verdict, it was toby.
he hires people and inspires people.
number 14, declining to speak first.
thank you, phyllis.
really?
relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
how about a woman?
let us get down to some wine drinking.
i have already told him, but i will tell him again if you think that will help.
hey.
each tribe will have a leader that i will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking.
e-mail from stanley.
alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse.

nature's viagra!
you did not cover it at all.
how long does it take you to pick out a soda?
kidding.
you are that friend.
this is very boring stuff.
electricity.
well, okay, in a nutshell, what I am saying is... leadership.
different management styles.
hey, dwight.
for what?
punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
you can trust that i am telling you the truth.
looks like i am the killer.
stanley, i got you some ganja.
i made the connection.
we have not even started this horrible process of... okay, creed.
and i was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
a good life.
really sad.
hi.
and lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as nana starts to... but, i knew i should be saving it for something, i just did not know what i should be saving it for.
well, we have a surplus.
yeah, okay, i did that.
yeah shhh... i... that was just... i was breathing.
no, no, no.
it is christmas.
there we go.
yeah, uh, attention, please.
concierge marie.
actually i had two fish stick sandwiches.
you know what?

best out of seven.
that is what jim and dwight thought.
do not we all look skinny?
what up?
yeah.
but then i was promoted to manager, at a very young age.
yeah.
nobody is nobody's bitch.
does not make any sense... god is dead.
uh, i better tell somebody.
you know what?
i have to do a presentation.
who am i playing?

I am psyched you all made it.
that is stupid.
so what is the problem, pam?
you know, i want this to be cutting edge.
there is the traitor!
does not it?
you too?
oh, wow.
you can get out of here.
aw, shucks, tell him I am not here.
what for?
the first time i threw mine away, i thought it was an ant trap.
well, comedy's kind of my thing.
you know what?
the buyer was very motivated, as was i. it went for eighty percent of what i paid.
i mean I am out of here at five sharp.
i do not want to talk about that.
alright, bye.
watch out for this guy.
think of me as one of your models.
we can try.
let us get real.
god!
i did not get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.

just give it!
no, i did not.
good.
do not let us down.
mmmm, sounds yummy.
oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
really?
the worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
they did this up in albany... and they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so... well, I am their boss, so i feel like... anybody want any coffee or... women in the workplace... yeah, translation "i have been banned from my own conference room so that jan can talk in secret to all the girls." oh!
what is: we are fine?
we need new chairs.
i do not care.
it is rude, and unsexual.
oh, hey!
well, it has certain connotations.
that is nice though.
oooh-ooh.
no.
do not go.
back to work.
are you kidding me?
it is like last week i was at the video store.
go ahead.
i wrote you a goodbye poem.
yes.

it is not even a twirl, it is a spin.
ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention please.
mmmhmm.

stop it, stop it, stop it.
nope, it will not be gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to luke.
count to three, please.
"life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...sometimes you deal with it, today you do not, sometimes you do, what you want... there is a world out there....
I am joking.
they are going to have... you can not say that, all right?
yes, i have to begin every day by letting jan know what i intend to accomplish, and then i have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what i <i>did</i> accomplish.
I am going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.
t.m.i.?
that is what i hate bittersweet chocolate.
cool!
i... all right.
why did the convict have to be a black guy?
but when you need my help because i am ruining everything, do not look at me.
let us go.
hello, I am broken mountain.
okay.

I will save you!
holly, i love you so, so, so much.
and in ten years, i am living in a big house, with my kids.
i just... i just want a little taste of it.
wow!
doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
thought so too.
no, no, no.
do not let them down.
you are just a name and number and no one even says hello."  card!
remember what i tried there?
I am not, do not rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.
i wish jim had fallen into that pond and he would have to put on my suit and it would be too short and he would look... damn it!
i think this feast is over and it is time to go to the hospital.
okay.
you are  lucky you are so darn cute.
why?
are you ready for this, albert?
yes, yes, yes.
300 dollars do i hear 300 dollars?
oh.

all we do is work... is work.
i want people to cut loose.
i do not think i could ever give back to you what you have given me today.
you did not get the joke.
hey, stop it!
one person chooses a gift.
that is it!
mm-hmm.
sir.

and i am happy and i am rich and i never die.
i will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.

hey, hey, hey.
come on.
it is time for the great spoon and egg race.
i have learned a lot about indian culture tonight.
there is a point there.
yeah!
wait!
nice side note: they might think "hey, i should have been nicer to michael."  but that is... not why I am doing this... then, i land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.
we are in the heart of it.
it is really amazing.
thank you.
that is what she said.
really?
i do not ask for much for christmas, i really do not.
a rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
well, it is, it is- no.
well, that is not the david wallace that i remember.
I am not worried.
it is good to be accommodating of that.

plus, you can eat your own hair.
that is - yes.
hey, what up, cynthia?
i do not even know how to say this, but cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. and that is not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
okay, guys, guys, cool it.
i want you to think about your future in this company.
next.
yep.
ryan is being a little bitch again.

and i will start, by giving the first gift to phyllis!
oh my god.
jan, i uh want to... can i help you?
i do not know, it is just... i know.

now that i have your attention... money!
and you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
i catch the ball.
oh.
excellent.
it bothers me.
yes, for dramatic affect.
you know, like old times, instead of... agh, god, you know what, could this day get any worse?
nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years.

after this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
the sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in scranton.
okay.
they are awesome.
and meredith needs this job.
and i always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, i think it might be one or the other.
nope, get away.
let us - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman.
i mean, i can tell her it is part of the job!
i think this is going to be the best christmas party ever.
no!
long-distance relationships never work.
i do not want to do any of that.
ah, it is just easier to say t.m.i.
i think she is... no that is very unprofessional.
when i wake up, i plug in the grill, i go back to sleep again.
hello hello!
i worked in a warehouse.
i mean, who saw the movie titanic?
well, you know what, everybody thinks that i am crazy, and that tells me that i am the sanest person i know.
what is this?

there is no time to think about if this is real.
.
how do you know this?

tony?
I am out of answers january i told you, no more answers.

all right.
i told them busiest...idiots.
just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone.
what are you doing?
i had promised carol a romantic evening on the town.
yeah.
you could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.
hi, i am well, how are you?
hm?
i am not going to rent the third bedroom.
i have my passport.
how about, uh, fine arts?
no sales topic per se.
i am busting a gut.
oh, one more thing.
okay!
well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.
I am goin 'in!
okay, we are done.
i guess this could be the one, huh?
if i have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she is going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
that is my sale!
well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions.
well, I am going through a little bit of a rough patch.
ohh... it is creed's birthday.
that is, uh, edward r. meow.

jim taking the initiative.

nothing.
thank you very much.
uh, well, i am.
and I am very angry, and i want... I am going to kill you.
well, it was love at first sight.

wh-why, ok, i think you are still a little bit drunk  excuse me?
i wanted to kiss her.
i swore to myself that if i ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as i walked away.
oh, wow.
we are selling success.
may i have your attention please?
r thinks he is too good to be here, and p is not as much fun without jim.
april 13th, 2002. that is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs.
it is about who is the best boss.
this is a calculator.
you might think he is a puppet.
ok, let us do this thing.
in die hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter.
and those of you who do not, i forgive you.
and it does not need to be clean.
you joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... they are adults, for god's sake.
well they do not.
i was excited about meeting somebody new.
that i cannot get out.
roll of duct tape and a knife.
that is like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
i know, i know.
i think what i meant was that i was completely swearing off one woman.
wait!
there you go.
oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town.
so, i... ummm... i do not know.
no better, no worse.
i will do my job to the best of my abilities.
he is, however, an idiot.
hope you brought the milk duds!
exactly that.
did you get lucky?
excuse me  ah, un guard.
okay.
okay.
at night.
and right over there is where you found out that meredith was prostituting herself for outback steak.
whooo, nice.
yes!
god!
and i think we need to break up.
go!
so we should get the check?
ok, i think, it might have been an inside consultant.
attention, everyone!
hangin' with my crew, crew that i am one of.
dwight!
yeah.
we will see.
herrow.
I am very picky.
all right.
and they are saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
two of their branches have closed within the last year.
very good, very good.
I am sorry.
no, we are not.
ok, forget it.
I am not sick!
yeah.
okay, well, this will not do.
i do not have time for your tv show.
oh, wow!
well, well.
good.
you are fired!
in every beat of my heart, we got something going on.
there is tons of ideas in there.
that and that are the same letter.
i see steak.
stop doing it.
i am a victim of a hate crime.
you remember ryan  and pam is around here somewhere.
i specifically went on vacation so i would miss it.
i know.
no.
three stooges.
david?
feedback?
happy secretary's day.
i, i want to.
are you kidding me?
shall we go?
you guys are so beautiful.
okay.
alright.
who is seen that before?
mm.
a lot better than i did earlier.
ok. come on january after all we have been through... we have a history... ...between us.
and that-- that was a sucky thing to do man.
oh- okay , what?
i will call david wallace.
byyyyyye.
the, uh, business of team building and morale boosting.
I will call you later.
you know what, if i had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be mr. "outside hire." yeah.
guzzled it down.
because I have got nothing got lose.
oh, hey guys.
and he needs to clean me up a little bit.
the stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
but do you realize that that was actually dwight's idea?
oh my god.
ohh, ohh.
that is a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.
not michael, e.t.
he is at the supermarket and he needs me.
good friends with privileges.
and, like saber, it is from florida, and it is good.
no you would not.
well, I would recommend it.
phyllis and meredith are not little.
that was great, she gets it!
he is holding a pencil.
we will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
my wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, "i do not respect you!" ahh, thoughtless.
no false modesty, my friend.
what are you doing this evening?
they are really angry.
i do not know, holly mentioned that there were some complaints.
courage.
i opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
it was on the booze cruise.
it is like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
you are still here.
i have a lot of toilet ideas.
things were at an all time sad here.
most people when they come to new york, they go straight to the empire state building, that is pretty touristy.
they were.
okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
time to go get my improv on.
have fun, you two.
here we go.
ok. i am putting this on so i have no familiarity with my surroundings.
yeah.
you suck!
because i want you to behave as if I am actually firing him, oscar, okay?
who is got the hungry?
it is friday morning and it is another beautiful day in scranton, pennsylvania.
and that is not because he is black.
i think you should do that.
mmm-hmm.
i want you to help us work on some banter.
and that she was better than all the other hos in the world.
wow.
it was part of the party.
thanks.
give it to me.
these things sell themselves.
yeah, I am good.
andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
fire guy.
follow my lead.
so, you are filming history.
the chain of command is crumbling.
it should be me and pete, not pete and tom.
everybody stop working.
insult.
and i do not want to hear "ahnnn... i can not help elhh la la." no.
so here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building.
ah, ah, ah, ah... he is an organ donor.
sure?
you are not.
okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
okay.
really?
you do not, you do not know me.
which memo?
let us go!
black-eyed crows.
you know what?
but you know what?
what can we do to help you out?
america, i do not think you need to worry.
please just check.
when meredith flashed me at that christmas party, i nearly vomited.
well you should take a, a film education course.
so what was rule two?
when you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?
can not i take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
what are you doing?
that is her fault.
all right.
wow... oh, wait a second, i can not tonight... tonight's so... too many times.
nice!
that felt good.
oookay.
thought you might hit me.
are you insane?
I am your friend.
what is a pallet?
shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel.
watch this.
if you said "I am sorry" in front of everybody.
i do not understand when you all talk at the same time.
alright.
i was not.
mmhm.
i think the old honor system was just fine.
okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.
and, god...  that is my phone.
ry, is he bugging you?
um.
um, so  it is not too late.
pam beesly.
it is st. patrick's day, and here in scranton that is a huge deal.
who wants to start?
yes, kevin.
the only reason i am standing out here right now is because i do not want to take the elevator with her.
oh.
enjoy the partay.
she got the kids right?
okay.
ok. you just, uh, clear your head.
there is one that sounds like a jackhammer.
i learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year.
you all took a life here today.
see you next year.
this guy used to steal sales from us; now, he is going to steal sales for us.
all right, big ticket item.
all right.
it is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here.
everybody, let us just get over the whole meredith thing.
packer is turning in his car for a desk.
should we go?
like the witness protection program.
actually, you should... better hold onto  them pills, just in case.
because of the time i got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
it could be done out of love.
and carol came over.
I will just throw out some suggestions.
where are they?
men's warehouse.
that is good.
poopball?
umm... and jan definitely, if there was room.
when we rented 'armageddon'... ... he cried at the end of it.
other people are complaining about the chairs.
i do not know i think we have done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day.
this is plenty complicated.
can you even drive them in traffic?
yep.
where is my translator?
i love pad thai.
he had a transplant when he was seventeen.
zip it, toby!
and andy, where is he?
how is that possible?
look at this stuff.
oh!
well, he needs a permanent number, right?
no, i do not.
hey.
it is just noise coming out of an ugly scientist.
the best way to learn is by watching.
we had sex.
wha?
i am not dwight schrute.
yes, i can ride a bike.
no, no, listen, as a friend, i want you to have this.
I am not giving you the answer.
good.
mmm!
my grandpa was the funnest guy i ever knew.
hey you know what?
oh.
that is.
i heard a- very very funny joke the other day.
yeah.
he is turning in his condoms, for a condominium!
aw, you know what do not get no respect?
all right?
jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
good job.
she demoted me to your job!
yes, good luck with that.
so they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.
we just did it.
i am pam.
a celebration of oscar.
look, i do not want to leave this branch that i love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round.
wait, i did not hear a thing you just said.
it is uh... two and a half.
and i like to pack heavy.
ok, dwight grab your stuff, we are going to new york to party with ryan and to meet girls.
come on.
that is -- thanks.
she is not playing.
that was awesome.
just... well... crystal.
yep.
you may be right.
christmas bonus.
get out.
oh, no you di-int.
big weirdo creep.
twins.
no, i meant about being single today.
and she is here, like you, to learn from what i have to say.
we are going to prove, what the hell is that music?
you are welcome.
oh, all right.
it is not, uh, it is not just about her, so... mint chocolate chip!
no, no, i do not, but-- i... will not.
you are not prying this out of my hands, but do not tempt me because I will give it to you!
we are getting there folks.
you know what, pam?
what you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her.
my wife do not get no respect, some-take her, please, for example.
fine, fine.
500 and one penny.
manhattan is the other name.
jan has plastic boobs!
yes.
oh... yeah... ugh.
shia la beef because of disturbia.
pam, everybody!
is it really so horrible that i could possibly go out and find happiness.
stop your eating!
well... he is the longest baby in this room.
now, one important life preserver in business is it support.
we are done.
jim, dwight, andy and stanley.
see, this is good, we are learning and we are figuring some stuff out.
ok, wendy.
hello, hello!
was i smiling?
yeah, kiss her.
twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a hindu halloween.
the best.
i can not even look at her without thinking about it ending.
take bat bites seriously.
ok?
so back to work.
well who, his sister?
I will be in my office if you need me.
maybe even one of angela's famous brownies.
it was a young guatemalan guy.
how is your nephew?
ok. it is a fish.
i did not... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.
people will draw unfair conclusions about martin and or black people.
i love ya pam... okay.
after you said you were not coming, i invited carol to come and i do not think that i did anything wrong.
i am so used to being the bad boy.
let us do it!
jim and i are great friends.
per diem.
now, I am in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.
stop... stop it!
um... i always imagined it with a giant check.
he drives a corvette.
um it is, grotti.
here is how things work here: my job is to make the office fun.
who here has the comedy central roast channel?
how do you know that you were not born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?
no, we will not call david wallace.
not nice.
and this is the opposite of shallow.
ambitious.
is there anyone else who could do it better?
kevin, here you go!
that is actually not a good example, because i have been compared to a young paul newman, my eyes and my face.
let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth.
andy, andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad.
michael scarn.
or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
jesus sort of ruined the party.
i am ashamed at your naked face.
ohhh.
you will get there.
okay, here we go, there is a cow.
and I am hot, I am so hot.
no.
my life!
i... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, i knew that it was wrong.
okay, you know what?
it seems a little foggy.
tell them that i died, and i turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
i know!
these things seldom work out.
a g-n-of if you will.
what is up?
about what?
i cannot promise you that.
I would like to make a wish.
yes.
oh yeah, they do not allow kids at sandals.
well, you are boner-ific.
hello.
ahhh, dwight, may i have your chair please?
would not be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
i-- ok. how much is this going to cost?
return.
tell him that your supervisor is on the line.
ryan!
why did you have to go off  and die?
this is what I am talking about.
can i hold her?
bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
jo invites michael to house.
do you want to hear a lie?
alright?
oh, nicknames, yay!
sorry.
i once had a dream.
oil can.
nothing.
it will be good.
right?
i do not know.
i knew it all along!
hey!
when carol said 'no.' tonight, i think i finally realized how you must be feeling.
it is sort of weird that i went and did that.
what is your problem?
but, i am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.
we hang out a ton, mostly at work.
and, believe me, i could have.
oh, that smells good.
aids.
shout  them out, shout  them out.
we will find another way, we will ask power-point.
i-i have a business to run.
this is... emotionally magnificent.
it is kind of snooty.
gay.
and you already know dunder-mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway.
great.
macgruber!
push it!
do you like tcby?
she is a beautiful indian woman.
shut it.
no, jim please, repeat what you are saying!
sorry.
are we all set?
all right.
they say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.
nothing.
here come the sharks.
okay.
okay, sure.
you do not need to help me here.
we are going to have fun.
i might do the spin.
i have faith in you.
stop your mouth, please.
no!
shut up.
we will be back with some answers.
you said ten.
well, we do not- whatever, yeah.
let us just... play act.
kay.
well, i do not believe that.
you know what, i would not worry about angela.
loser.
what are you doing?
like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.
i want you to take me down.
it would be a great, great concert.
what?
i love him.
not what i was looking for, but a good thought.
good work.
very good, um, so, darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now.
.
and that is the way we like it.
untested.
look at that.
fact: jim and i talk all the time.
everywhere a woof, woof.
i would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
I am just... i, i can not even imagine... the... thing.
that sounds good.
flower shops, fireworks celebrations... moolit gandala, carrage drive through central park... an electric car dealership.
ok, I will stand near you.
and this is something that i live by.
uh... uh, i do not know.
are you sure?
I am first mate, as the captain.
this is ridiculous.
i know this place.
josh reminds me of a guy i went to high school with.
uh huh.
nobody needs to introduce this guy.
and i just want all of us to have a good time!
i will bribe you.
this is disgusting.
better torque.
i, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder.
she is.
good, all right.
that is some sort of weird creature that lives in david wallace's house.
yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
what do we got, what do we got?
so you do not miss it.
no.
wow.
ok. well... hook you up, there.
bye-bye.
i am ready to do this!
please.
um, then he went home to what is now formerly yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him.
welcome.
ener-gize... everybody, so how are we going to energize our office?
big deal.
all of them.
do you understand, you forced my hand?
well, why do not you tell me what those are, jim?
monkey problem?
you are just a bunch of voyeurs.
no wikipedia.
so without further ado, carol?
and i had to spend the entire winter in shorts.
they have been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
look, this is very hard for me, but I am going to give you my best man.
aaaall right.
it is a town car.
you are, uh you are like the new and improved pam.
ahhhh!
okay, how is it going in here?
hey, shut up toby.
here we go.
ethical.
it is funny.
I am right.
or me.
on purpose?
thanks so much.
i do not want you to go.
houston, we have a problem.
no!
i want you to live forever.
i do not know.
the suspense is just so exciting, is not it?
wait, wait, wait.
mwah!
people!
just... they are going to want to hear this from you.
okay, okay, we do not have much time.
not a good idea to say that to a woman however.
that is not a toast.
funk is the problem and the solution.
oh, that is a good idea.
throw your poop.
pacific ocean.
you and i are hangin' tonight.
oh, my god.
i was a hell raiser.
alright?
how you doing?
it is not the key to happiness.
come on!
how smart is that?
think of it as part of your training.
I am one of those babies from "look who is talking." what am i thinking?
as is toying with a man's heart.
hi, everybody.
what do you think?
oh really, what role is that?
if you are guessing forty six just say forty six.
would you like some french toast?
ummm... hm... no.
let us play with him.
i wanted to be surprised.
hey, hey, hey.
and when you meet one, it is intoxicating.
plenty of space in the parking lot.
but if you stay, i want an apology,  and i want a big one.
i think it was good.
no, I am always good... for some serious buckage.
that is going to happen, you know.
oh.
we already have that.
think happy thoughts.
here we go.
that is from superman?
i knew that finding a successor would be difficult.
pam, you will be girl a and girl b will be... okay!
yes it is.
ahhhh... maybe neither.
I am excited by that.
i am going to totally pimp this place out.
we did what we should have done, we just got bested.
just be funny.
just show off the twins a little bit.
you complained that angela's giving you dirty looks.
where are all the hot people?
i did not feel much when i held astrid, but i got a good feeling from holly.
and I have incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
it is my fault.
a joke always works.
go, go, go!
yeah, well I am calling the ungrateful bi-atch hotline!
um... I am trying to think of what we could sell.
hello, is this r. gould?
all right, all right, all right.
you can not.
pam's mom.
do not be.
you know what?
come on, everybody.
come on, stanley let us go.
pam?
oh, um, potato salad.
adult cut plus.
what started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
it happens.
pam, i have a mission to accomplish.
what is this?
if you ever need any help, i am just a phone call away.
I am going to... you take care of that.
I have written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and i think i have done my part with the golden ticket promotion.
where are we?
no, no, no, no.
no, no, no.
what is up?
alright.
i am sick over this thing.
captain jack is a fart face.
it is like michael jordan, in the nba finals.
pow!
hot.
ok, i will only need two things.
i mean, who would buy that?
where do you want to be?
meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
nice to meet you, bill.
i do not think you will regret it.
indians do not eat monkey brains.
I am not firing anyone.
i need you to do something for me.
oh, god.
it is modern day.
now, no one was there in the wine cellar.
yeah, i told them on the phone that i was ordering eight pizzas.
oh, god!
hang a swing from this tree.
do not shave my lips.
i can just continue to run it myself.
everybody, david wallace and i have talked and we have decided to promote jim to the position of co-manager.
so you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?
good, you take the lead on this one.
because of all the good work you have done.
okay.
it is too late to undo it.
and up comes the toolbar, that is what she said.
so, let us consider this matter ended.
i can not shop at a fancy norwegian boutique.
yeah.
well, they are just for guests.
me.
yeah.
and then in an instant it was not.
that is me again.
no.
i know, i know, i know.
so who else?
I am trying to write something funny here, okay.
okay.
let us face it.
yeah, no, it is nobody.
um, nothing.
sales.
what did people believe in before?
why?
no.
hey!
what am i gong to do?
mr. temp.
come on.
corporate really does not really interfere with me at all.
a funnel?
did you hear pam is pregnant?
well, we are going to recalling all of that paper.
well, do not put words in my mouth.
why do not you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.
we are here because there is something wrong with society.
when i was growing up it meant lame.
deck hands is one.
you need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
last one down is a rotten egg.
and, because it is the future, i can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
it is from "sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to sabre, us.
what do you think of this place?
I am about to tell everybody.
god.
aah!
i have my hbo comedy special, here i go again dot-dot-dot.
no.
dwight, hey.
let us, uh,... let us rock.
okay!
okay, um, there was a girl from dunder mifflin.
out please!
i remember in high school, my math teacher told me i was going to flunk out.
that is jim's now.
god.
what is your last name?
that is just what we need, another black man in prison.
ah, ringbearer.
everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
that way you would not miss you-know-who so much.
leaving pennsylvania.
tell you what, if you want it, it is yours.
she poses.
it is a tough one.
rock and roll.
no, no, i totally get it.
you are ruining the party.
i always call everybody back right away.
i think i just have to wait out you.
but as you know, david and jan, it is much more.
hey, are you texting?
so, what is the scuttlebutt?
here is the thing.
you know what?
were they in the missionary position?
go to bernie's?
or pukey.
sorry.
do not- testify.
well, that is not my fault, okay?
well... s-sure i can.
um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass.
oh... okay.
da  na na na na.
so put on your saris, it is time to celebrate diwali.
frank regan funeral home?
brings back so many memories.
i will make it very quick.
no, we know.
get over here.
okay.
hmmm.
there is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.
thank you.
i thought that you were engaged?
employer of the bride.
help!!
he is right there.
okay, bags.
okay, let me tell you what we are looking for.
we work hard, we play hard.
not if we turn these dials  all the way down.
that is wrecked.
he is running, but he can not hide because you know what?
i do not.
mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm.
yeah, i bet it is!
we are going to sit here for a while, make it look good.
all right?
i would love a glass, if you are going to open it.
stop!
no.
good.
I will have what she is having!
babe alert!
who?
thanks to me she went to the hospital and i saved her life.
maybe.
come on in.
i hope it will fit, with all these little knickknacks.
um... find out if there is a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
come on, you in?
we are not- okay.
what a tool.
take cheech and chong everybody knows that cheech and chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they did not smoke pot.
no-- we are all unstable.
there you go.
stop.
previously on varsity blues... hi jan!
out of a box or something?
it is part of the sales experience.
the electric city.
go away.
hmm, i see, feisty.
some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.
okay, um.
was this year's dundies a success?
not in the same bed.
so, uh, dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
i do not know who you have not met yet, but i think this is one of them.
you are like a hundred.
why does not she just tell you what your schedule is?
he took me to a baseball game once, i remember.
look.
come on.
no, i do not want to do that because I am twice your size anyway.
and that is why, i am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
here is the sitch.
if they are good ideas, I am not going to say no!
that is dangerous.
I am not firing him.
all right.
i start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes.
thank you very much.
oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
ok, here are your character cards.
incidentally, i love the place.
we made a terrible mistake here.
i just had a quick question for you.
a lot of passion, a lot of heart.
nothing.
well, i passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee.
attention please!
do not tell them we have free delivery!
I am mork from ork." well, I am bork from spork.
stop it!
somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like .
it is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy.
is it going to be worth it?
sure it is.
ummm.
what do you need?
what do i write?
and then darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.
phyllis, look at-  okay, that is...  all right, all right.
tastes like splenda, gets you drunk like scotch.
you know what?
good to see you.
umm... hey.
yes, yes i do.
ok... is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
but there is no downsizing, so just do not... mmm, mm, mm.
maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy.
give me the phone.
alright.
pam?
of course.
I am a very busy man.
david got fired.
at home?
dwight!
please do not do this.
mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone?
we will do it quickly.
andy?
good to see you.
come on.
ok well, who else?
i have not decided yet.
a lot better than hers, that is for sure.
it is beautiful.
what about pam?
alright.
what?
uh... it was like eight years ago?
all-in.
good trip down?
i can not wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife.
dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
and have a good elevator ride.
why do not you bring erin to balance you out?
you are not dating angela anymore.
clean up the mess.
so.
these two.
kelly thank you.
you are good.
it was love at first see with my ears.
no, no!
mm, nope.
i have to say, i think the problem with that whole thing... ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
twice.
did you?
hold on a second, cynthia.
i have not finished writing.
yes!
by the bushes?
ok, buhhhh, i burned my foot very badly on my foreman grill and i now need someone to come and bring me into work.
my wishes never come true, so I am not going to wish that on her.
as if you are trying to impress a much older man who is way out of your league.
he is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman.
an extraordinary time.
wow!
this has been my dream for eleven years, and if you do not think it is great than you are basically saying that you do not believe in my dream.
people say it is icky.
oh, man.
let us see what i have to put on the list, right?
that is so awful.
this is inappropriate.
okay.
so... there you go.
am i a hero?
right guys, because of gay?
and it is in the paper today.
uh, i do not know what you mean.
let those things breathe.
oscar is my friend -- ...and i just do not care who sees it, does not bother me!
what?
you hit register-- updates are ready.
most companies need their carrots the next day.
it is easy.
i love this car.
he is back!
i did not think it was per mile kind of deal.
just crunch  them please.
perfect, well, we are settled.
you are a very handsome man, get in the car.
oh man, you should order milk.
i am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so - thank you, jim is with me.
maybe there is some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too.
what is october feast?
no, nope, no one is helping me out at all mom.
hey!
and that is one suit phyllis cannot fit into.
welcome, welcome!
thank you, ryan, for that wonderful introduction.
yeah!
who is, uh... who is next?
but we can not lose the spirit of child like wonder.
but sweet because david wallace thought i did a good job.
they hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.
why do not you just take these women, put  them in a burlap sack, and hit  them with a stick?
boom!
what shape?
pam.
i could go for an appeteaser.
well, i never thought I would see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
you know what i just wanted to remind you about the game today.
cake?
tonight.
ok, well i did not get the job in new york, but i got the real prize, domestic bliss.
toward the sun.
just really grabs your attention.
we do not have to call him that.
n- okay.
you were forbidden.
yes.
i can not believe it is- i can not believe it is yogurt.
I am staying on the bus.
all right.
she has a weird voice.
angelina jolie was on.
i will call him later with that message.
no!
yeah, let us just cancel this, okay?
i will speak from the heart.
come on, come on, let us go.
yeah we all want money.
well that goes without saying.
dwight, a genuine rastafarian wig.
it is not terminator.
well, come on, let us have an auction.
have a hand .
I will get some punch.
why do not they just want you to go by yourself?
and I would point to them, right?
at the very least it is bisexual.
yes, all right.
i only did it because i nailed the wave.
really shoving our faces in it this year.
read it out loud.
this is not dunder mifflin paper.
and perhaps the most important person to indian culture, sir ben kingsley.
conference room, five minutes.
you knew that.
yeah, that would be amazing.
hey, it is cool, man, i work in the warehouse!
i love it, i love this tv.
why do not, why do not i take you out to lunch?
be respectful, dwight.
anybody want to share?
yes it is.
yes.
you have to pick up after them.
thanks.
I am not going to go out and ask for a raise right now.
let us give this a shot.
i withdrew too.
whaaaat?
jim where is pam?
to holly, it is been the worst week of her life, and i know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever.
and also, i would like to say that i will be canceling my trip down to tallahassee.
oh, really?
it is about perks.
so.
a lot.
okay, i will start.
he is not going to say any of that.
i could fire you.
i get it!
that is... you have just been drawing pictures.
yes.
hello.
angela.
how long have you known about the pregnancy?
I will call him.
my boss is coming in today, the lovely jan levinson-gould will, well, no gould.
where is the line?
everybody, may i have you attention please?
what are you doing?
merry christmas, little children!
hey, sherri.
ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.
i braveheart.
the question back to the answer.
i did it!
who to pick?
ryan?
and i offer same day, free delivery.
you know, i would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
just hangin'.
not a native speaker.
uh huh.
i do not know what your body feels like because i can not touch it.
um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?
it is me own damn fault.
yeah, maybe.
good.
no.
during our relaxation exercise?
oh, okay.
well, do not bother quitting because you are fired.
I am teaching him a lesson.
or david wallace will call us on line two.
make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
I am not so sure.
okay, alright.
well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
time out.
uh, just never happened.
back to work.
i am a local business owner and i would like to find out about your company.
i love it!
sabre.
no, i will ex-squeeze you.
it is perfect, thank you.
conference room!
stupid corporate wet blankets.
it hurts my stomach.
you could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets.
that is too private." here is how it works.
ok, who is hungry  no, no, no.
how late do we have to work tonight?
we are just joking around.
yeah, well, did i teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?
yes, let us get right into the anderson account, shall we?
that should scare you.
hey, doc?
thanks for going out, guys.
party planning committee together again!
i think we could have done better than that.
nope nope nope no.
let us follow the chain of events.
I am good.
i call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
and finally... no, no, no, no, wait.
this'll be  the day that i died.
how can he still not know?
yes!
computron?
i appreciate the feedback.
"you have won a tiny dundie." hey, thanks guys.
let us talk.
okay, all right.
oh, wow, so quickly.
ohhhkay, this is great!
right.
ok. 'oooh.
i said i hate the, the style.
we have fun.
well, happy birthday, jesus.
I am serious.
thank you, scranton strangler.
but... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
tell you one thing, dunder-mifflin is here to stay.
wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I am completely overwhelmed.
you know, i want to go and, and find out something about myself, i want to get outta here.
right now!
ugh, not you.
yourself.
let us get to work.
i kind of arranged it.
i suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
i do not know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid.
which is rendered useless without batteries, and i have one for each of you.
a one-on-one lunch with erin?
that is the best thing?
god.
let me know about the job.
yeah.
i was not exactly looking at the road.
i claimed it.
would you stop it, please?
dwight has something he would like to say.
i do not know what I am going to do!
we wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
charging.
this way to the partay bus.
and you are smart.
this is where we first kissed.
you guys are the reason i went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, god bless, god bless america, and get home safe.
now, if she is engaged, I am going to go crazy, and I am going to start attacking people.
you know, i do not care what he did to me.
ow!
bogy at 3 of the clock.
it is super duper."  i do not know, something like that.
a-ha-ha-ho.
i feel weak today.
when you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
did you get all dark meat like i like?
even the hot ones are not really that skinny.
thank you, god, for creating two of you.
write it down.
what are we still doing here?
and i realized that i could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.
it is not sweetie, it is michael scott.
well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today.
hey- come here.
meredith?
pam, listen.
is that clear enough for you?
why do i like hooters?
it is a very natural reaction.
i am blowing dodge.
bet you can hear me, too.
out of, like, 18 billion americans, so, no worry.
dwight, i asked him.
I am right here, I am right here.
as part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing.
me, too.
okay... okay.
did not move my lips.
and maybe you should cry.
c'mon!
yeah, i know, i know.
go pirates!
you are thinking of the broad jump.
thank you.
all you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers.
just push and breathe.
you know ryan.
yup.
thank you very much.
um, let me ask you, is there a term besides mexican that you prefer?
you idiot.
okay get off, get off!
oh god...i better call.
the ship is sinking!
you do not... you do not call retarded people "retards".
jim is jealous of me.
i believe we are expected.
we need a new copier.
shh!
you are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
get me armani.
ahem.
i just... you could not understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?
because that is what you are doing.
boom!
dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there is a lot of dumb people out there.
it just sort of lost what die hard was.
because i look at somebody like jim halpert and i think, that guy can do anything he wants to do.
oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
what do you mean hmm-um?
ok... what... can i do, for you?
that is... who makes that?
might be good.
you are welcome.
um, when people say something is mutual, it never is.
would you like fries with that?
last time i saw this john, he was-he was not a victim, if you know what I am talkin about.
i am going to be cupid, and i am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say "I am in love i was hit by cupid's sparrow."  funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
a little bit.
carry on.
i hate the fact that we have to do this together.
yeah.
and I am looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
i was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
you are going to run us out of business, pam.
arrest that man!
mifflin, spifflin.
mrs. allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.
and it is r rated, it is not rated g. i am like eddie murphy in "raw," and they are trying to make me into eddie murphy in "daddy daycare." both great movies, but, still.
you are a bad person." it is very dramatic.
i knew what i was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
thousands of people have done it, and i am going to do it.
crazy, crazy world.
woo!
hi.
yes they are, you just do not care about the information.
yes she does.
i call shuffle.
do you really mean that?
but, if you do your spring cleaning in january; guess what you do not have to do in the spring?
andy, what is the problem?
yeah, you know what?
the romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we have remained good friends.
think abou- think!
he could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper.
come on out!
oscar, this is katy.
right?
you have plans.
excuse me, mr. wallace?
games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.
just follow my lead.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
ugh!
you deserve it!
you know what is not funny?
presents.
what?
write it yourself.
here he comes.
push them back... wait...  no, it is this one, right here.
hmm, hmm.
if i were you, charles miner, i would watch your step.
we are not worthy.
i am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
hey pam, all this stuff with kevin... um, it is pretty scary.
this is not michael scott talking right now, this is your future.
what are you doing in there?
herro everybodeeee.
ohhh... mmm... no, i like the attention.
i look around and i see all these beautiful people who are alone on valentine's, and i think that there are other single people out there too.
hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.
oh god!
I am a big believer in people being here more.
really.
a boss is like a teacher.
no.
pamela.
so what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit.
aw, my car.
i think so.
i know what will impress everybody, I will start a fire.
oh... i do not know, actually.
yeah, we hugged it out.
this is my girlfriend - carol.
alright!
woo!
um, i am never going to forget today.
i feel like a real puerto rican.
really?
good job.
there is a big surprise.
i have made a very sizable donation to oscar's nephew's... walkathon.
okay.
as i was saying it.
get lost.
come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
thank you.
whoa!
what a day!
we are going bankrupt, you think?
let me tell you something.
okay.
it is european and... yes?
it is like a time bomb... ...is ticking down.
let us go to the hospital, shall we?
nine dollars.
i am so sorry that phyllis hates you.
guess what he is doing now.
do we have a deal?
i also stole something off of her computer.
no, this is not a joke.
if you are so anxious to see a head roll, it is you.
I will tell you something charles, i do not even care.
and what we are all about here in scranton.
no!
do you like mints?
friends fight.
yes.
what is up my brotha?
actually, it is more of a guy's afternoon in.
do you look like you are laughing?
incentive.
god.
no.
let us send up accounting.
i have been saying the word "manager" a lot, so whenever jo thinks "manager" she thinks of me.
cons, she does not always follow through.
ah!
ok, just remember to keep breathing.
jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.
it is a sophisticated take.
hmm.
no.
oh, it would have worked out so well.
what are you going to call him?
and when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.
this is our casa.
and i just wanted to call you all here, together, because i have something important.
i will have you know that i asked donna about this and she is fine with it.
why did you pollute?
hello, my lady.
well.
i will not.
well...get ready, because it is going to get better.
right... executive assistant.
be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
no, for one thing, he is not gay.
too bad.
oh, my life... everything's wrong.
no, stanley.
yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack.
you can go to hell.
you know what?
since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
you need to go a little bit further.
does she do it as my superior?
i-yes.
everybody can not get enough of the jolly old man.
anybody?
thank you.
pam, pam!
i think in order to be a ladies man, it is imperative that people do not know you are a ladies man, so i kind of play that close to the chest.
is anyone still at the church?
shh, just stop.
whoa.
did i mess up my career today?
i have now memorized all of your names.
mmm-hm-hmm.
koselli.
well, then i will get a warrantee.
he is just, he is a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
he gets it back on friday.
alright.
you are so lucky!
hello.
you are weird.
right?
you know what?
andy was transferred here.
yeah, i got to get in on this.
what?
and you know what?
look jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.
you down with the dundies?
let us do this.
no.
good ideas, huh?
osprey?
i think sounds have a lot to do with that.
it started with..  holly flax, marrying me will you be?
no, no, no.
i had put it on my calendar and pam threw that out.
what?
okay.
so... i will see you up there in viagra falls!
january three, 2011. a day which will live in-famously.
okay, sorry, let us, who else?
I am not too fast.
because i can give you a ride.
yeah, that is right.
what is that?
find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
you are kidding me.
tonight's event is to benefit the boy scouts of america.
it would have been nice if luke had been able to stay here.
that sound...  the air-conditioning leaking or something?
oh.
if you will - - follow me this way.
that is, whatever stupid show you want- to watch tonight we are watching it.
how could that happen?
shh.
good riddance.
okay, driver, driver, if you are not going to stop this bus, then I am going to stop it for you.
i am going to get up, and i am going to be out in the common area.
yes.
nope, that is tuesday.
i am, uh, michael scott, regional manager of the scranton branch.
i can not believe i gave her my bike!
so, okay, you are a salesman.
and rabies wins.
very good.
you can not leave yet.
and they were right.
bring a wet towel.
I am going to cover for you.
those are very good.
that is terrible... terrible news for both of us .
better handling.
and so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, i would like to say that dunder mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.
uhh... hehe hah!
with phyllises and kevins sprouting up all over the place.
if we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  "apology accepted", i think we would all feel better.
oh, my god.
who is that?
because i always know how to get through to him.
they are not breathing.
or that the sport does not exist?
right.
would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at dunder mifflin?
I am kind of a bookworm.
you are, you are.
i do not think so.
it is a baby, see?
have pam come down.
that is what I have heard.
answer the door.
sold for 1,000 dollar.
nasa took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
i am offering up my services to you all.
a dsi?
because if you want to beat china you will.
white people love pizza.
right, I am going to spend the day in the hospital, bujehh.
who else?
okay, i know what is going on.
oscar the grouch.
really?
they do not let us use cups.
we were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point.
it is not good enough... hey.
we are going to have a baby.
i do not get what you mean.
this is where i belong.
let us not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.
i am not leaving this office.
it is like a mock execution.
that defeats the whole purpose.
all right, I have warmed them up for you.
hey.
no, no.
i do not expect everybody to understand.
good.
just a second.
do the boobs!
and  packer decides to make out with her.
i learned that she has read "lonesome dove" three times.
alright, you know what?
the men's room was disgusting.
so you just rat me out?
um... martin, from stamford, was, at one time, in prison.
oh.
good.
this is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of splenda.
no, it... yes, okay, right.
no!
this'll be just us.
jo likes michael.
no.
but you bought it!
it would... be fine.
do you-do you have cravings?
i know that a lot of you are very angry with ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, i swear to god, if any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or... yeah.
and the third time... i did it out of spite.
today, at the end of the day, i will have, for all of you, a big surprise.
the late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.
i could have fallen off a roof today... and you do not worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... and there are no roofs in coal mines.
wow.
okay, i do not have time for this.
god, that is terrible man.
alright, panic room, maverick, nell, sommersby, the accused.
because i am not going to call sabre and say, 'hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today?
i should have been there to witness this.
okay, guys, guys, guys.
but i can teach you enough so that you do not embarrass me or the company.
no, I am not trying to trick him.
this is going to sound weird, but i think i may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole pam situation.
can not tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body.
show me that farm.
now she knows what it is like to be a minority.
island living.
where is the line, january no, I have seen the video.
why do not you just take off early?
so what do i do?
it is my brain-grandchild.
keep simulating.
toby's going away!
take one, pass it down.
what?
comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
i think you have a great accent.
is there anything accounting-wise i can do to sort of make it all go away?
it was nice to see devon again.
owns a quizno's on the turnpike.
actually better than a five-star hotel because you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.
best friend/mentor.
i do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out.
was its heart beating, toby?
hmm... look at her smile.
here we go  oh god.
yeah.
I am trying to congratulate you.
i could make... i could make a profit if i changed one of the ingredients to wishbone  but i will not do it.
no, nothing happened.
pam you are an artist, right?
this had better be terrible.
we are not going to eat you."  no.
the diabetes award goes to stanley hudson!
i could murder him.
this is it.
helene i think you are a wonderful person and i- god- I have enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.
secret weapon!
mm.
do you get it?
jim, to be fair, the conversation was not about planets... at first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper.
no, no, ridiculous.
and it is the sincerest form of flattery.
hi.
you never forget.
no.
go!
you bet your fat ass we are.
well, we are extremely sorry.
yo-da.
pam, put that in my good idea folder.
and the hotel which sucked big time.
that is my line!
ok, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power.
that happens occasionally.
hey, hey, it is as interesting as a morgue.
do you want half?
i know but I am still scared i do not know why.
i need backup.
i am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper.
please do not say anything.
no, no, no, no.
it is actually a lot bigger than it seems.
he is alive.
I will be right back.
do not cash that till friday, ok?
and they would rather be in the hole.
like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between "a" gym and "b" gym, that sort of thing?
just say you want to get back together.
mmm-hmm.
i think the engineer left.
okay.
we make  them come to work, and we work  them, and we make  them sit next to all the people they screwed over.
we got the check, but we are just going to need a much, much bigger check.
everybody can laugh.
why have i stayed at dunder mifflin for so long?
how we doing on time?
will not ruin it for you.
okay.
ok, come on everybody, go time.
what is so great about your lives that you think you are better than everybody else?
although david wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses.
I am going around to all the branches, and I am telling them my secret recipe for success.
all right.
it is home, you know?
there you go.
how is yoga?
who else?
so, I am a little overwhelmed.
someone is returning!
out.
I am sorry.
i hate so much about the things that you choose to be.
i feel you.
but I am not sure he is a great fit for the office.
no.
maybe.
i have not heard the same about you.
that is all i know so far, but I am going to keep practicing.
but this was mutual.
you are creative.
I have been trying to keep it going.
well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good.
they have a tcby booth.
i did what i had to do.
well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me mr. scott.
really?
give me a hug.
"for a good time, call michael scott"?
it dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, let us get back in there.
it is britney bitch.
uh, what flavor?
you guys think donna's cheating on me?
stephanie could you hop off please?
that is a foul.
that is not going to happen.
to can-a-da.
stanley.
i can not... i can not dress like donald trump dresses.
you said it.
this is the world famous rockefeller center.
this is what we want.
I am just kidding.
i really think that papa would want you to do this.
good.
and, well, she does not do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.
my treat.
excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
you have to enjoy it.
i can not even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis.
sometimes i spend too much time volunteering.
I would love to be a part of one someday.
okay.
I am done.
nine days, though.
it is a tribute to one of the greats... mr. adam sandler.
cracked?
you!
really.
nobody likes to be flashed.
did you ever have intercourse in this office?
is there no way we can get rid of him?
the states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest.
was anyone killed?
no, no, not until you give me an adjective.
thirty-one!
i did it.
did you know that the age discrimination and employment act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older?
all right.
sun beating down on the mayonnaise.
to quote from the princess bride "mawige... the most important part of a speech is the opening line.
oh my god.
yeah, randy newman's the best.
i can not hear what he is saying, but he looks like he is really into it.
that is-- that is alright.
i have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
but do not you call it that, I have earned the right.
they have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong.
you got a good life.
i happen to think the old ways of doing business are better.
oh!
all that paper burning up.
that is a good point.
uh-huh.
and there are- no no no wait!
he says stanley uses his miracle whip without asking.
come over here!
how about you, pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
something that dwight does not like.
takers, please.
do you think she would keep it quiet?
you know what phyllis, i think you need to step it up.
brrrp!
well, i hope this conversation has helped.
and I am going to go get me a new york slice.
I would... yes, i will hold.
nope.
and how can i be lonely with my boys?
and i think it is better to die with people you like... like oscar, and andy, and concierge marie... than to know that there is somebody out there that you love that you are not with.
nothing.
what is this about?
um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.
i would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... i would be waving that rainbow flag.
did you see oprah yesterday?
maybe.
the city's laid out from east to west and our public parks are libraries are truly the best.
no!
yeah, just wait.
do you want me to find out what it says?
how is everybody doing today?
take care of that, all right?
stop.
let us go.
ok, you know what, i mark it urgent a, urgent b, urgent c, urgent d. urgent a is the most important, urgent d you do not even really have to worry about.
in short... what?
thanks, kowalsky.
hey, hey, hey.
alright, everybody here?
how dare you, dwight?
i had um, one of those danishes.
no kidding.
no!
you might want to use him to sort of get that orville redenbacher dynamic going.
enough!
and if we did, it would be with jim and pam.
it is johnny carson, karnak.
anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about.
i just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
are you kidding me?
have a good night.
and you loom so large in my heart that i crossed the line.
yeah.
... because we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt.
do i really want to go snowboarding?
they are very formal.
just relax, ok?
so, fyi, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template.
it was not, it sucked.
I am going to give him mouth to mouth.
hey.
got it, dave.
you know my seduction method.
one million dollar!
yep.
come on.
the dundies are my baby, and they need to go on.
this is michael jackson calling from wonderland.
who is going?
oh, really?
carroll, how are you?
we are done!
uh... "does she have to plan her wedding on office time?
that was totally legitimate.
yes!
hey!
I have updated our contacts, i have gotten quotes from suppliers.
yes.
a couple of years ago, i went to one in hartford.
it was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
good morning.
hey pam, did you see this?
let us keep this rollin'... ryan?
we are all still here.
so, strike one, i hate her already.
they are like breadsticks on steroids.
actually-- no, bulgaria.
i will be honest with you.
i do not think he is that good.
is christian slater back there?
it is one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
guys, i believe that i have figured out what is up your butts.
that is  heresy, my friend!
no it is not.
why do not you guys get to know each other?
angela, stanley, oscar, meredith, phyllis, kevin, creed.
why?
no.
boom.
it was hard.
and the caption would read: in the dump.
ryan, enough with the texting machine.
i need the name of a good private investigator.
really?
your meeting.
i can do it good.
"please, would you be so kind as to call my wife?
scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" wow.
keep.
i am dead inside.
me just got back to the office.
I will kill you man!
a good manager has got to be hungry.
i am the ace bee.
I am trying to get a date with pam's hot friend.
do we know how?
i need him gone.
i think this is going great.
too swamped, you know?
yeah, yeah, yeah.
today helped.
uh, what the hell is happening?
okay.
she is my family.
you good?
i actually wear a turban sometimes.
here is what we are going to do.
single.
okay.
yeah.
what?
okay.
oh.
what is happening to me?
you are?
but that is where we are in america.
what a game.
I am a big fan of anything joe rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.
and i did not want to see them fall victim to the system, so i made them a promise.
i had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency.
oscar!
whoo!
it is just a joke.
that is right.
ok, wait a second.
i can, and i have.
ryan is visiting.
get in the cards!
i think it is kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
get set!
and that.
and you know that.
i want people making out in closets.
they have no willpower.
i went down to the parking lot and i was... i returned her barrette  we ki... we did.
well I am going to show them that we have nerfs of steel.
oh.
trust me.
they were very disrespectful to me, and to the office.
we dated for a while.
you know what that is?
did you hear stanley's having an affair?
it is something that I have been pushing, that I have been wanting to push, for a long time and corporate mandated it.
guess where i am going.
that is what happened to of.j.
i am your host, michael scott.
i need to know.
i thought it would either be an 'a' or an 'a+' but i completely forgot that there is an 'a++'.
let us get this movin'.
call it the holy spirit or the passion of the christ.
ok, buddy." any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.
I am good.
okay, let us go to hayworth's.
woo!
what is the world's largest ocean?
hey, everybody.
uh, he is a small client.
okay.
there is a chance.
michael scott.
ok, I will take it.
okay... okay.
yep, get it.
mmhm.
oh, thanks.
holly's favorite.
i call her hillary rodham clinton.
ha haaaaa.
and you think that would be sexy?
all right?
earthlings.
corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about dunder mifflin infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it is uh, not too shabby.
ah, still sends his own proxy.
oh... my... god, that is why people are leaving.
the other day, in the parking lot, i actually found a condom.
remember what you said?
i nailed the interview.
wh-why not?
oh ok. for how long?
sorry about that.
probably tonight.
3,000 g's.
okay.
and i may come down and fire you if you do not do your job."  but what were talking about when we first kissed?
it is not 1890 anymore.
hey, kevin.
very rude.
no.
come on, andy, seriously.
he sucked.
do not break the branches, dwight.
i have a discount.
just-no, no, no, no!
you know what?
this is our warehouse.
dwight, just, just leave them alone please.
because i am not pleased.
they just relate to pay scale.
that is a very nice way of putting it, oscar.
a mediator's tool chest.
sure you do not want to come?
i have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.
you know what, i better hold off.
they invited me to come here today.
inventory's at the end of december.
not a giant net.
phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you do not often speak your mind, but you should.
sure you do not want me to help you with that?
do not worry pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... your long lovely life.
... um... is, uh, holly flax anywhere here?
you are not even dating."  she is my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing.
but not too much fun!
that is good to know.
that'a girl.
sound good?
come on olympics of suffering right here.
wow, like kevin, rating the best bars in scranton?
i am all over this.
i... do not.
cool.
... I am just kidding.
just leave it.
game over.
yes.
seven.
kenny g. god.
and that is something that you learn when you go to jamaica, and you really apply yourself.
it is cute, but it is... it is empty, you know?
the press is just going to find out by themselves.
do not burn the building down.
I am sorry.
we do not need a new copier.
now i know what the founders of phillip-morris felt like.
you know what?
you are right, phyllis, but I have been there before.
happiest day of my life.
yes!
he has taken my idea.
your donuts make me go nuts!
and i want it to be oscar-specific.
is that right?
who are you helping?
you know what?
it is, it is weird, you do not, you just go by the x. the x means times.
look, look, look.
mmhmm, okay.
pam!
yeah!
and around the corner.
and then type it up, in a way that is helpful.
that was amazing!
come on it.
eeee.
my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
i will not I am just saying we have something... ok. whatever.
pam, could we change something on this?
uh, let us just decide and agree upon one.
god!
that is what I am talking about!
i missed, i missed the important part again!
i do not understand.
that is natural.
dwight.
"scranton area paper company, dunder mifflin, apologizes to valued client.
thank you.
well, corporate's going to go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could jan?
whoa!
um... i think we are under an hour still, so... i know.
not from the kitchen.
what are you talking about?
i... okay, i will think about it.
I am being serious.
double it.
i do not know.
my son, theo, loves jello pudding pops too.
ok. all right.
that your car?
no, i do not-this does not change anything.
it will.
but, it was integral to the story.
ah, it is after five.
you, me, dwight are going to jump into my pt cruiser, and we are going to crush this sale.
you know drew, why do not you go inside.
okay.
yes, but you could tell me.
there he is, there he is.
so let us just, ryan, could you get my coat please.
does not have to be a racecar.
you are?
that was mean.
hey.
buenos dias, jaime.
where is she hiding?
thank you.
goldenface is going to blow up the nhl all star game tomorrow.
let me try something, just while we are waiting.
that is the opposite of the point that I am trying to make.
alrighty, dwighty, let us see how you did.
yeah?
because i already did.
christian?
yeah.
hey, hey, you.
i am a grown-up, jim.
pam, could you put jan on, please?
when jan and i had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called "survivorman." and, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
how did that feel when i tore that up?
because it is more special.
I am good.
all right.
"my stumps." like "my humps" but a guy with no legs.
she totally got me.
i can not go through with this.
all right, um... sorry.
what are you talking about- forget that.
you know what, I am going to raise the stakes.
be serious.
you want to give back to society.
maybe have lunch together?
yes, i do!
you might think that i am kidding, and i understand that.
everybody ready?
where did you get your outfit?
you are going to hell stanley.
weird... he sounds like a nice guy.
the first person to shout "shotgun" when you are within the sight of the car gets the front seat.
oscar's roommate.
oooh, alright I will talk to her.
any emails today?
so it does.
yes.
pump it up!
oh, ok. let me just cut to the chase, dwight.
anybody else?
it is mother nature.
you know what?
they sound awful.
waagh!
oh, that is the muppet show, on dvd, classic.
pam, stand up.
take some money.
all right, all right, shh!
it is got a little bit of a zing to it and i hope that it gives you a flavor of what we are all about here at dunder mifflin.
check that out.
are you all afwaid?
which makes absolutely no sense.
that is like... I will call you, too.
well, then let us act it out.
go on!
all right, everybody stretch out a little bit.
"look on the supply shelf." what?
i... god sorry, sorry my head is... I am just, I am trying to figure out the last time that you and jim had sex, and... okay, mm hmm.
everyone would go to one santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she would ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." at which point the kgb would arrest you and send you to siberia.
dwight schrute is a close second with three and a half!
so in norway, you would be the weirdos.
nurse.
yeah, okay, dancing!
that was wonderful.
there we go.
wait.
pukey's good.
so, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
oh, no, do not.
i would like a nice slice of christmas pam.
did you catch that or did... did the cough cover it?
jan, hello.
here we go!
listen up.
son of a bitch.
shoot, shoot it.
i know, here we go.
do not.
you know who you would love?
I am going to go wash my eyes.
really?
that was darryl philbin's.
42897.  ok. pam, could i see you in my office?
yes, hello.
guys, guys- that is okay.
great!
go bag!
and remind them what is great about this place.
oh!
now nobody knows whether i am here, or whether i am gone.
but you know what?
I am hitler.
here is what we are going to do.
alright.
and i made a bit of a judgment call.
computron is just one of the many modern devices that i have incorporated into the office.
whatever you got to do.
have a seat.
um, for instance, i learned the pledge of allegiance by setting it to the tune of old macdonald.
ergo de facto.
all right.
yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.
what have we here?
why me?
you know what?
the choice is yours.
sometimes you are such a little spaz!
could i talk to you for a second?
why did not you stay?
get a... yeah!
we should have your contract done by thursday.
toby flenderson, come on up here.
the important thing is i learned something.
oh, good.
what the hell was that?
i want you to really make fun of anything about me.
are we ready?
creepy guy who is abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
what does warm mean?
i have assembled what i believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today.
you love it.
i do not understand?
my wish has come true, incidentally, because, you have met me, and you are happy.
you know how?
why... why are you making this so hard?
i am really disappointed in the office's policy on pda at this moment.
are we smart?
great.
alright.
due to circumstances beyond my control - hey, hey.
you and the misses should join us at sandals jamaica next christmas.
it is about to get all stupid up in here.
which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." i do not understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.
aaaaeeexcellent!
a world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life.
me in new york?
what is a bad idea?
and i feel like you want more than this little office has to offer.
when ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in hazelton just so the other girl would not see.
on the count of three we are all going to put down our guns.
life-size.
i may be crazy.
i need you to get better.
wow.
so, basically, i want to do something nice for my employees.
thank you.
hope nobody's on a diet.
what you are doing is so funny.
ha.
no.
and now, i realize that you can program or download any ring you want.
...and that is the watch that you are going to wear?
they are a small company.
yeah!
okay!
a lot of people are really getting into halloween this year!
that is dwight.
i did not say it!
yeah.
now, we cannot let the pedophile win again!
at least.
just something i have to do first.
and oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.
dwight, are you peeing?
that is the whole day.
you really screwed that up.
a document called "dear michael." i should not have done it.
mmm, what flavour coffee is that?
I am doing your job man.
all right.
onk onk.
even though i only went number one.
yeah, so what if i did?
stanley,  terribly nice guy.
who are you picturing?
do not be a baby!
come on.
i do not know where she is.
scuse me!
the people.
and limo lady, we are going completely carbon neutral.
ok. what was dwight thinking?
the most important wedding until i get married.
some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat.
she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move.
and she wears pioneer women clothing.
why is not it in my hand?
sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady.
feelin' hot, hot, hot!
dwight is an obvious candidate for my job.
god, i do not understand women.
come on.
perfect skin.
tell him.
but, I am, I am not like wham-bam.
very important.
it just... goes a cup could find its way under the urine.
crazy world.
let us do it.
he has a surprise.
ryan's next.
that is great.
it is about you.
this mexican guy.
so i, you know, an employee will go home, and he will tell his neighbor, "hey, did you get an award?" and the neighbor will say, "no man.
what do we sell?
oh god, i can not think, need more mullins.
how did you get this number?
he does not know anything, and neither do you.
then i wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.
I would like to see a big smile.
yeah, well... this is not the phone.
cool.
no.
seventy, eighty, one, two three.
does it stink?
we are doing fine.
so, well, ok. see you guys on monday.
welcome.
i can not, ok, I am going to call her.
i ping!
I am okay.
old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!
yup, I am good, whew.
okay.
holly, everybody.
yeah, okay.
limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan.
i am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
it is kind of nice... it is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful.
uh huh.
hello!
hey, you know what would even be better?
although that will change.
you were charging me?
those slide moves are just bush league.
why are you here?
i talked to corporate, and they told me that i can only give you a 5% raise.
relax.
before i shoot you in the head.
oohh.
we are laughing at phyllis, but she is not even here, so no harm, no foul.
wow!
i would like to see someone else pull this off.
you can not expect them to be careful every time.
i want people to be afraid of how much they love me.
yes, you have a job.
get me an ice cream sandwich.
okay, and... okay.
all right.
ok.  well, if it is just going to be one, i will think of a different joke.
yeah, whatever.
you suck!
we will demonstrate on pam.
because this is way, way too good.
i am, but you are the eva peron to my cesar chavez.
this is your last meal, so eat up.
i do not understand-  hold on.
yes, thanks, fantastic sam's.
this is... my home.
does not even matter.
take your bad vibes with you.
as a boss, i look at that and say great.
and i do not know why you downgraded what we had but i did not make us up.
that question makes you sound gay.
I am definitely going to do it.
average kind?
cons: not a hard worker.
get the hell out of here, idiot.
it is surprise meredith.
one of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.
oh really?
oh!
</i> heads i do it, tails i do not.
and i call over to kevin, "kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" and he looks at me and he says, "michael, yes it is a tweed jacket." and i look back at him and i say, "i feel the need!... the need for tweed." oh, thank you.
homosapiens.
does your stupid husband have it?
excuse me.
you know what?
i would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
dun-der.
get outa here, please.
yes, but what you did not realize at the time was that i was with you in a sense.
yes, i... i have to buy another place.
okay, i... you know what?
oh yes, i will.
are these guys boring your ears off?
night everyone.
today is the hardest i have worked in a long, long time.
you know what that means?
to sort of get closure on that whole thing.
pam, please take a note that andy is patriotic.
holly's coming from new hampshire.
i think we are a great couple.
wonder where my e-vitation is.
the hero got the girl.
or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse?
he is a valued member of this company... and you know what?
you could not help your marriage.
we had a good time.
randall, cfo, resigned.
depends on who you ask.
it had to be done, it had to be done.
i love music.
you want help?
i got shotgun.
because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
do not ever touch a black man's radio!
are you kidding me?
this is her main source of money.
yeah, i know.
attention everybody.
was not that good?
you, are you sure you do not want a pony?
that is great.
santa's going to take some much-needed free time.
meredith!
but your life is very good, my friend.
the heart is smarter than the brain.
dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
i would not make that mistake again.
is that what we are learning in business school?
last time i was down there, i noticed they would put up a couple of hoops, and i play basketball every weekend.
american way?
this is what i thrive on.
why?
your enthusiasm's turning people off.
can i speak to you a minute?
michael scoon, fbi.
ok. ok. come on.
no, I am not busy.
so does this remind you of your childhood right now?
hey pack-man.
you know this can not go on.
have her come out!
you do not understand.
and that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing.
what?!
um... could somebody grab me the lever, and i will... yeah, get your hazards on for safety.
no, a <i>real</i> disability, not a woman's trouble.
no, no!
just leave it down.
by the time i get back to our floor, i will have decided.
huh?
that is the word on the street anyway.
really long.
every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars.
could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
because it will help.
you are welcome.
alright, relax.
and oh, jim... oh, i have not see you since my accident that i had when i fell- i fell into the pool of acid, eyes first.
philly, work with me here.
we should really start recycling.
hold it, hold it.
everybody, except stanley.
no, I am a regional manager-- no-- my-- ok, this is insane.
gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I am going to give the leads to... king creed!
i killed.
I am not sure, um, mountainton?
but you know what?
we need to do stuff together outside of work.
you can be martha stewart's receptionist!
you do not try tactic number eight on me.
conference room, choppity chip chop.
get pam.
keep the change.
uhh, i do not know.
my motto.
no, dwight!
it is the swat.
oh, you know.
what is she so upset about?
phyllis, stanley.
damn it.
that is kind of a big client.
because i do not think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart.
we are counting on ya.
separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key... alright.
yes.
you are going to end with "etcetera"?
lethal weapon?
supertramp?
you are relieved.
helene?
troops.
and i would like to start today by inspiring you.
and i never actually talked to corporate about it.
here too.
but i do know this.
ihop.
if there is anyone here who can finish it, it is you.
sorry, i was just in the neighborhood, thought I would come by, see... i do not know.
i just got a new account for the gentleman's club in carbondale.
yes we do.
thank you my friends, she is perfect!
because, well, jim.
you should get one of this big body pillows.
look.
he insulted us and he abandoned us.
that is, yep a little flimsy.
the combinations are endless.
yeah, well, phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so.
all right, attention everyone.
alright, well i just need to learn everything about china.
work it out amongst your selves!
no no no, let me see.
right here!
ok. when i am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away.
the same amount of work is done, whether i am here or not.
they love me.
very good!
me.
what?
stop it!
we are playing zone!
okay, let us do another one.
i do not know how ringling brothers do it.
well, look around.
alright.
no, no.
great.
boom!
here we go.
noon.
that is how we buy them actually.
no you can not.
threat neutralized.
and he signed!
come on.
he is a good mechanic.
you of all people should know that.
"michael" "boss" and "funny".
so i started thinking, who could handle this?
pack man, i thought you were a girl!
like a crazy person.
ready!
what is up-dog?

wow.
pam, this is from corporate.
okay.
hello there.
ugh.
now, god, what?
yeah!
green m&amp;ms!
i do not know.
you know why?
a little cover-up on your adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite.
and that is all that counts.
ye- no.
i need some meat.
we are off.
thank you dwight.
I am not going to bump.
i usually love babies, but when i held astrid i just felt... shortchanged.
but we did because we were ahead.
you know what?
eat that, carl lewis!
the paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.

set!
yes?
no.
ok?
uh, jim is not taking it seriously.
it is a start.
yeah, well, it is on the radio.

oh, you have got to be kidding me.
i know what you want to ask me.
queer eye.
not bad at all.
what do you do with the hog dogs that you do not sell?
so i spend most of my time right here.
i encourage that.
no.
i know, i know you are angry.
good.
i should update.
no.
I am just worried about my friend.
and i did too.
hey ryan.
i can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect.
you have one day." that is... they always give an ultimatum.
I am an awful guy!
you having fun?
that is what she said.
please.
i have bags under my eyes, pam.
off the hook.
group photo for the newsletter.
no.
deliciousity.
wanted to ask, did kathy ever make jv?
this is a skating rink and i think the rangers practice there sometimes and it is, that is tina fey .
that is the key.
on your mark!
the worst thing about prison was the... was the dementors.
foul!
and it blows.
yes!
this is probably the icebreaker you need.
duh, duh.
it could be done out of hate.
it looks like a  it looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm!
you never yell at the client.
you were a jet?
who is a fan of buff naked?
what you talking bout, wallace?
guys!
he told him.
hello, dwight.
...there is creed!
I am going with pam's group.
exactly, no.
because you think he is funnier than you?
that is the conon... the conun... the conumbery those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls.
it was done out of love, just like i thought.
that guy was weird.
oh.
okay, dwight.
i do not know how long she is going to last here.
it is urgent, i just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
i color code all my info.
and you are nervous... okay... umm... I am sure that bob... wow.
well... no, no.
I am robert mifflin.
oh... it was freezing.
if i can get them depressed, then I will have done my job.
no.
and she will not say, "i love you." nine dates.
bring it in!
what are you doing?
actually, I am a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano.
i do not want you to feel like I am baby-sitting you, or something.
what the hell are you reading to them?
wow, i did not expect that.
ugh.
i will talk to you on the bluetooth the entire trip.
how do you mean?
impressive.
so... how long till we get to mexico?
good.
not me.
oh, no way.
oh my god.
could not she do that at home?"  who else?
bob, how old are you?
my weekend was bad so far.
i do not see what is so hard to believe about that.
you should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year.
i do not feel bad.
oh you do not, that is- that sounds good.
i regret offending my coworkers.
well i got a little something something.
and like donna.
yes, definitely.
check this out!
have not had a hug all day.
it is true!
welcome to your future.
darryl, watch this.
okay, you are never going to believe this.
ugh.
i already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
it is done!
glad you could all make it.
i used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.
well, he was getting a lot of applause, and i just did not think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
rachel.
look at me, I am toby, I am stretching, i know what I am doing.
calm down.
bring it in.
they are so arrogant.
okay.
dwight?
i can not hear you!
is he in good shape?
he is outta here!
maybe I am crazy in love.
oh, ok, well I am looking for a passionate affair, not companionship.
you know what?
okay.
okay... you two, in the conference room with me.
you see this on my desk?
we are down here.
so pick a spot.
i am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management.
gah, just clocking me for no reason?
stanley.
whoa!
to be married?
pretty cool, huh?
fat people are not monsters!
chili's is great.
you are funny, very good and funny.
you are a jerk.
I am kidding.
there is a lot of choices.
this just stinks.
believe me, i have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
here is my toast.
oh!
i can not watch pixar.
pam, you gave me your word.
can i talk to you for a minute?
no, that is not how i meant it.
yeah, i know.
all right, cool!
yes!
i was like, 'oh, i guess I am a loser.
and i was about to take her bra off... ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork- no!
who is on him?
we are a team.
right here.
you know, but she sort of keeps it real.
what?
oh, okay.
well I am looking at a photo, right now.
that is what ryan is like.
mrs. allen was our customer.
catch you on the flippity flip.
toby, come on.
no.
okay.
to tell you or not.
it is part of your pants.
in the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs.
and that her butt refuses to quit!
you do not want anything?
i will dig into those later.
ok. excuse me.
I am sorry.
yes i was.
you are the bait for toby?
unless, of course, you are in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without creepsville central spying on you.
i should be there in about 15... that is what she said.
here is what you do.
and it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that is the mystery.
pictures.
i was a fool to think that i could beat it.
business has been pretty crazy around the office.
that is him.
i will... dwight and angela are having an affair, so... dwight and angela are having an affair.
i love it!
why?
i will not call you that.
i just winged it.
not again.
I am sorry?
ok. who else?
well... oh, i... pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.

I am not... I am not firing somebody on the first day.

...that is what she said.
hey uh, question for you.
in all climates.
thought that was you.
wait a sec.
really?
ryan, my man!
alright, skip around the room.
there are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
i brought all your friends from the office dear.
i did not see any heart.
a crescent allan?
wait, wait.
i do not know.
hey, i just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.
our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in scranton.
friends only.
somebody get him!
i mean have this kind of party.
i call the school, i tell them I am a pediatrician.
it is a ram.
what i want you to do, is i want you to look inward.
earlier today this office needed a santa.
okay.
was it nice?
I am not in a bad mood.
one 'of clock.
did you ever think of this?
not.
martin went from being a new guy from stamford... to a convict, to... my friend.
he is being a real twerp about it, so, it is all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
all right.
good clothes.
just a little something i whipped up.
oh, okay.
yekkk.
jim halpert.

so i do not think that this is totally just a woman's suit.
hi, january hello, baby.
pam, could i have a word with you in my office?
stop.
ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!
once, as a joke, packer banged every chick in the office.
i have a very good feeling about it.
tonight the scranton business park is having casino night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall.
well, you know what?

you put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
yes, jim?
let us go.
whether it is not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team does not exist.
hi, children.
uh... ten year.
ohmmm my god if you are wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm... my goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for stanley hudson as i can.

hey, january how you doing?
there are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.
yes, sir.

but what some of you might not know is that i am also part native american indian.
hup!
you are bad.
i love you-love you.
that is insane.
change your mind we can get you a cot.
no, this is geological.
that... well, that... hey.
all right.
that is what makes it fun.
alcohol is a drag.
i would like you to meet andrew bernard.
ohh, yeah, let us get started because uh, yes, because uh this is very serious business and umm.. ...business meeting -- that is right!
speak.
we will have a car wash. we will send some cheerleaders to regionals.
okay!
he wakes up early.
what?
and i do not want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, carol.
hello.
and there are only, like five or six.
any - it just - you know what, i would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
who has not?
okay.
do not.
dunkin' donuts?
yes.
um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost.
no, a new copier!
she will "do" you.
and, she got him a cake, at the restaurant.
very perfect.
i got to call her, and I am going to tell her, that i cannot come.
right there.
come on!
it is something that i... wanted to do... and so it is voluntary, really.
let us get our skate on!
I will take a shirt.
and since i do not have a butler, i have to do it myself.
yes!
umm, hmm?
the electric city.
I am thinking that i have something that you want.
you know?
and they are only interviewing a handful of people and I am the most qualified and I will probably get it.
oh, well, then, email it to me.
no, I am not going to call january  she would just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... who told you that?
hey.
fruit is so much better when it is dried.
especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first valentine's day since holly, so i think that i am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
have you given any more thought to dunder mifflin?
wow.
pretty disgusting.
so... well no harm no foul.
yeah, that was a joke.
and then she will move back to scranton.
come in.
come on man, got to step it up!
we will take one more.
and this little guy  may be dunder mifflin paper some day.
no.
i was thinking we could name the company something like, "paper great.
when i think about it, when i really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
right there.
please.
if you did not badger me with so many questions, pam, i could be done with it by now.
i am going to give you a piece of paper.
who is got the hungry?
i am what i am, oscar.
we are trying to win a contest here, kelly.
is jim out there?
remember from your wedding?
well, in his infinite wisdom, david wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of dunder mifflin.
I am going to give erin $15.
wow.
but do not worry, you know what?
I will see you in a bit.
he got us talking.
well, suck it up.
everybody who is going to go with me i want you to stomp your foot.
at all?
shotgun!
oh, yeah.
so do we just give up?
no.
come on, man!
fifty years, she is the best.
i do not know what I am grabbing here.
i made it sterile.
i did, it was stupid.
...  it is a million-dollar sale.
if in ten years, i have not had a baby, and you have not had a baby... twenty years.
yeah.
i already know what i am going to spend this on.
does not even need to be good.
the electric city.
i am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.
do not tell me, tell them.
well, okay, we can do questions.
damn it, i knew it!
i want to be the guy who gives everything back.
if they did not work, everybody would still be in the cage.
it scares me.
i am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about.
i do not need your help.
so what are our options?
just... what is the matter with you?
ooh, wow.
david, they do not believe me.
i am not going to give up that easy.
that is a 200 dollar plasma screen tv you just killed!
so let us see what we can find out from reading.
oh, yeah.
hey, what say we order up some pasta?
goodbye toby, it is been nice.
acting!
my treat.
goodbye my lover.
well, let us put  them in the hallway.
told it.
oh, my god, vero beach.
bye... bye.
and then prey on their emotions.
is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
we have company.
still deciding?
no, you want to leave.
I am a little peeved at darryl right now.
yes, so, no thank you.
ah.
okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
yes.
no.
they are all fake stories.
it turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
I am just kidding.
toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special.
thank you.
what?
okay, okay.
whoo!
and i looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads.
i actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
and for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "serenity by jan" what do you think about that?
yes?
it was on you tube.
well, it will not be that fast, but it will-- it will be that easy.
i can literally say anything i want.
i love you guys.
dude, where is my office?
no.
that marriage would be a sham.
it is next.
this was my hot towel.
thank you so much.
and we will always be friends.
extreme home makeover puts together a house in an hour.
so, i guess we are getting back together.
you are going to get seasick if you keep reading in here.
they told me.
this is katy.
this guy does it all.
bye.
come on.
here we go.
yeah.
but jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out.
nuh-uh.
do not sell your implants please.
we resolved a lot today, everybody.
what is it... why are you crying?
i do not understand a word of it.
we are not worthy.
well, it turns out that teri was already suspicious, because she had caught stanley and cynthia a few months ago.
oh, this is even worse.
...what?
we are?
alright?
he did not say.
nope.
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.
yes.
and also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.
attention, everybody.
your performance has been adequate.
but it talked about the actual course.
long drive in the car, so let us just- we will just continue.
please do not do that.
I am facebook.
is that egg salad?
oh no!!
what is it?
i would love to take them all to jamaica, but is that good management?
thank you!
who knows how words are formed.
the problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it is scary or bad, but i do not.
here we go.
because i believe in rewarding people for their efforts.
no, no.
good economic sense.
is making people act weird.
i... love it!!
i think you are over-thinking it.
um... andy and dwight are rockin' the sales team.
no guests today.
but we did not have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
well, it says here that it is a 300ft drop.
i am the creative genius.
is this the only reason you are calling, jan?
this happens, you have a lot to learn my friend.
excuse me.
no, no.
oh, my god!
hey, you want some espresso?
oh, what is that?
oh, here we go.
very nice.
reservations are at 8:00, so we have got like an hour and 45 minutes.
enjoy the show.
thank god.
look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.
got to bring our... a game.
me you me!
dunder mifflin family only.
dwight...  you just keep your eyes on the road.
but you did still love him.
they reminded me of kindergarten.
is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
i only had an hour to put it together but I am going to add on to it later on.
but i always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.
really?
you are all such wonderful, innocent people.
no signs of life down here.
what is going on?
hey!
is this guy andy bernard.
ok. you are welcome.
when i was in the sandbox as a kid, i got not respect.
sounds fun.
he is just... everybody.
i said if corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they are going to have to go through me.
um, yes.
did you learn that on the streets?
i... i... i... yes.
a boss's salary is not just about money, it is about perks.
pam?
or women, present company excluded.
sure.
you have been my most trusted ally.
de-nied!
okay, let us go.
i am going to love it.
that is true.
i got an offer that you can not refuse.
may god guide you in your quest.
no!
I would prefer it if they died, because it is not right.
no, i do not.
what is your problem man?
i mean, i can wait till then.
i know, grumble, grumble.
david?
ah, i have to get back to work.
okay.
everybody told me that you were not interested.
i know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering meredith's life by hitting her, with my car.
gah... no.
it is a huge hit.
listen, i like kids.
well, not exactly what i was looking for but thanks guys.
ok, let us do it.
when i was on vacation, i met a man named bavon.
yes.
but i will.
well, you did not even hear it.
lists are good.
i want you to rub butter on my foot.
i was just... after the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
you do something to me that i can not explain.
i have no idea.
oh c'mon!
300 dollars.
i do not remember saying that.
let us go, let us go!
oh that is mine actually.
because that is not cool.
I am not usually the butt of the joke.
the world sends people your way... ryan came to me through a temp agency.
to raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies.
not really so much.
quiz me up.
is there somebody you date?
pudding... I am trying to think of another dessert to do.
what are we building down there again?
check please.
well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for michael g. scott.
over our love.
you are absolutely right.
I am sick of the little disapproving head shakes.
what do you do?
well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of chili's.
gotcha.
you can call.
that is not a joke.
keep it up stanley and you will lose new year's.
but it is already three of the clock!
no, hey  it is just kind of uncool, okay?
you have been so wonderful!
ok, alright.
you are gross.
no... no, you are not going to collect them.
i will take the fall.
we are not that different, you and i.  when i clamped my foot into a non-stick... yeah... ok. did you see born on the fourth of july?
you leaked it?
look at this one.
i got to get off this bus.
the file name is "jamaican jan sun princess." not important.
she is a good boss.
a person who works in this office.
got it?
you are making it worse.
as i watched pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face i saw my entire life flash before my eyes.
yeah!
yeah.
woo hoo!
these two people, they are living together, they are having lots of consentual sex- yes.
the cfo is taking away my house and giving it to josh.
oscar, you do not know what the hell you are talking about.
this was a pretty disappointing day.
that is why everybody was applauding for me at the end.
stand up.
i wish you luck, toby.
yes, i am, absolutely.
compact.
might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot... no.
because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job.
i have some bad news.
ok. darryl, would you do the honors?
well, here you go.
the only signal that i am sending is: <i>gay, good</i>.
let me slow down a little bit.
oh, not at all.
you mean this one?
moron, if he was there would not be a story.
so, i want you all on your best behavior or so help me, god.
this is not as much fun as i thought it would be.
... please do not send dwight!
i know.
but you know me and you trust me.
and then work our way up to death drop.
i think we should celebrate.
that would be humiliating.
i do not know.
that that bird was dead?
well, I am not really one for making speeches.
look at that.
gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz.
everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.
thank you, andy.
it is... hey're making a huge, huge mistake.
lotta smells.
yes, i am, but i want shotgun for you.
but he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face.
could i get some more pickles?
roasted.
and i vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
because I am not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba- i have a very difficult decision to make.
why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?
and we have an eternal struggle, you and i. and only one of us can be the winner.
sounds great.
"i like your food." come on stir the pot.
who is the birthday?
ok, give me the ball.
thank you very much.
it is hard to choose.
it is where business happens.
but do not worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.
no, no.
am i worried?
there is... a name.
and hearing about what a great boss i am.
pam, come here for a second.
anything?
you are my best friend.
good.
that is the ability to know when something is about to happen.
he pointed.
yes and you know what?
his name is bavon.
go.
this is a little character i like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on karnack, one of carson's classic characters.
people, wait, wait, wait.
keep.
alright.
"meredith is so old..." "she is so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her." that was not even mine.
i want you to take jim's chair.
i cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
i stole a sleeve of her sweater.
welcome, welcome!
did you pee on a stick?
hey, ryan.
well, you are going to have to run, or you are going to be in a lot of trouble.
yeah i was tripling up.
i want the house, january i want the picket fence.
enabler!
do not move a muscle.
she strong?
no.
when things sort of get hard.
like, who do i call about that?
horrible person.
no, no, no!
no, this is a power suit.
you and pam have both been nominated for dundie awards!
wow.
you know, i had never been out of the country before now?
it does not translate.
I will take it from here.
look at that.
and that is why so many other people in my class were kids.
in training.
wow.
mmwa.
tell me, please!
your face is saying do not- unless i have not offered you enough... your face is not changing.
do i know what the surprise is?
phyllis.
ah, thank you sir.
the rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.
crap.
but one would be good.
no, you said you could man.
she is hot.
really?!
pam's mom, helene.
ohhh, wow.
you know what is funny?
what is important to you?
the bouncer chases us out to packer's vette, jump in the vette, he <i>peels out</i>, and i  i do not make it to the car.
he treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
hey toby!
am i worried about that?
when i am breaking all the rules, i am break dancing.
yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
I am sorry.
she sits there all day.
and this next award is going out to our own little pam beesley... ...i think we all know what award pam is going to be getting this year.
and that was what today was supposed to be.
oh, wow.
well, no I have asked a lot of girls to dance mom.
somebody just walked in.
no.
ok. all right.
um,  taking her to sandals, jamaica, all-inclusive.
just have it ready.
it takes a big man to admit his mistake.
no.
you guys are going so slow... come on, I am going backwards.
hey.
eighty-three dollars.
well, suit yourself.
right, but 20 years ago we could not and that is amazing.
change the location of the meeting at the last second.
good, good, good.
the boss, hosts, the dundies!
what other ghost stories do you have for us?
I have never taken anybody there before.
this big fat pig is beautiful.
to not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
you know what, dwight?
great job, great laughs.
I am going to throw you this ball.
i totally see the merit!
yeah, i know.
they need to know that it was yours.
I will figure it out.
oh, good.
and this is everybody's favorite day.
no, no, no, no.
it was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and... i just hope that you and i can remain friends.
who would know what to do?
of course, i did.
ok, i will play guy listening.
in my office?
i bet he does that at home.
why would i... ?
i remember now.
oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-of!
well can, but will not.
my 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter.
it was anonymous." "well, guess what,  that was michael scott."  "but it was anonymous, how do you know?" "because I am him." come here.
jim, you are up.
like park on it.
bluh.
get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me.
here she is!
especially that one.
no.
everybody leaves?
we have only just begun.
carla?
hr stuff?
that is the michael scott guarantee.
my colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
from our very own scranton, pennsylvania - pam beesly.
i, um... i-ah!
i would love to burn your candles!
look at that.
no!
well, that is baloney, because grief is not wrong.
good.
sorry, my meeting ran late.
oh hey, for me.
nobody likes beets.
in person.
a little- what are you talking- what punch?
do you need a ride?
okay.
if you are unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with hr.
about dressing your best today?
we need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this!
we are reaaallly mooovin' now!
dammit to hell.
thank you, oh, gah, here we go again.
you, kelly and creed, kevin, they believe in you.
why do not you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I will tell them.
well you know what jim?
because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "i want to go to mount pocono," you go to mount pocono and you do her.
wow, kind of mean.
she invests in local businesses.
this is hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
just the bread, it is fresh baked.
you do not know what you are doing.
and i did not believe  them.
he was a gawky, tall salesman.
paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
you smell nice.
but I am the godfather.
and i did not... i never got closure, you know?
oh, hey.
i do not think it is in... that is not in tune.
hey, have you seen jim?
well we can do better than that.
sure.
what you want a cookie?
i let everybody down.
how nice for you.
he would dance.
let us hear it!
i feel good.
testicular cancer, god.
that was me, i got a little carried away.
air force is cool.
no.
i never sold any paper, because I am an idiot.
see that factory?
oh, thank you.
hello!
okay.
i think that is pretty interesting.
they spit.
yeah, i have fun.
yes.
i hired one musician, because i thought, what is better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
okay.
it is not going to have a big, fat, gross santa claus.
dwight, could you move over a little bit.
yes!
but he is very sensitive.
no, no, i never said denny's.
it is with great honor and privilege that i announce to you that i have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.
alright, no, no, no.
and i figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.
stamford versus scranton.
what are you doing?
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
get some white out.
okay.
pointless.
I am going to stay here as long as it takes.
okay, fine.
sure.
or maybe she is just an awesome woman from this planet.
I am worried about erin, because she is not a very good worker.
but it just may be a lunatic...  no.
yes, absolutely david.
i can not stay mad at you.
i love you, kelly.
why do not you get over lunch, oscar?
this is our receptionist, pam.
real fun day.
can we have the room please?
i wonder what is inside.
because i would actually like to bring them home and pack them.
she was the man.
boom!
you know what?
fine.
and when clients call and you are not smiling they can hear that in your voice.
i made a miraculous recovery, which is more than i can say for him.
bustier?
pukey.
what was that, kevin?
really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and... no, your job is being my friend, pam.
you talkin' to me?
you and pam?
and you can hug it out, bitch.
why is it so hard to meet people?
the people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends.
yep.
yeah, well...we call it overkill.
well, mr. kurt russell, you are about to be served.
there you are.
shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.
i have plenty of female friends.
hey, hey, hey what are you doing?
if you ask me, he caused the panic.
i know, just sayin'.
your face is almost back to normal.
ok. ok. there an accident?
huh.
thanks for coming in, that is always... always helpful when i give him a call.
there he is!
hey, you should stay because we are having fun and... where do you want to go?
a night... at... the roxbury.
three, two, one.
we are.
i think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.
maybe it was not so mutual after all.
and they are having problems, so sh... good in bed.
look around you.
no, he is not.
yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
and i want you to reflect.
nah, it is not.
they will be assisting you today.
burger king?
dwight.
yes.
they poisoned my mind.
i lied to myself too.
here we go.
what is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice?
so, party planning committee, get on it.
scott.
so, uh, what is the 411?
just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
i thought that would be too explosive.
you know your i.d.
why do you always do that?
i know.
part of your duties are to what?
clearly, karen is trying to get back at us because jim dumped her.
two are for souvenirs.
give it to me.
ah.
wait, is it a full moon tonight?
i know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what?
if tomorrow my company goes under, i will just start another paper company.
i know, somebody will.
so to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts.
boilerplate.
hey there.
there is a lot of choices.
I am on medication.
show time, part one.
let me show you to your area, sir.
without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy mr. benjamin franklin.
it will take a swat team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that." that is how devoted i am to this job.
god.
no, i do not think I am asking too much.
hey!
it may be somebody hot, like pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like phyllis, but just not me.
i do not know how george bush did it when colin powell left, and if utica thinks that they are going to poach stanley, they have another thing coming.
come on.
good to see ya, have a seat.
let me see your teeth.
holly and i are dating.
this has arms.
what is up?
ho ho ho!
nailed it.
no, they can not.
i do not know... i might just be a basketball machine.
.
okay.
i need to find a hundred clients.
everybody gather up.
so... dwight is not going to do a job.
right?
that is all i ever wanted.
just kidding he would not be interested in any of you.
here is what is going to happen.
okay... darryl!
you did not, but... it will be fine.
i want you to fall on your sword for me.
oh, come on.
ok, well since i am leading this, let us get down to business and why do not i just kind of introduce myself, ok?
ok, I will just have the pudding.
- and to king meredith!
give me...  give me the diary.
well, maybe i learned something from women after all.
do we feel good?
you think they would help each other out like that at corporate?
shut up!
yes, darryl, the sales department makes sales.
oh hey, kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
um, pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off.
get off!
i want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me.
sad, something to break.
and then another- oh, i do?!
and that you had said some things about kevin.
oh, i forgot.
so if i were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
'm' is for murder, 'p' is for... ...for phone.
mm hmm .
you are not going to play basketball.
looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
you cannot say "i was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, kelly.
c'mon.
there she is - jan levinson.
you meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that is how you do the scarn!
and the third guy says "i gotcha both beat, I am a proctologist, so i drive a brown probe".
no, that was inadvertent.
uh, pam, one more thing.
sometimes they are the nicest ones.
no.
you are fired.
you are all on a time out.
craiggers.
he is the tax man.
new guy!
there are clouds in the sky, which means going to rain, bad for business.
come on.
she probably will not be up for a few hours.
uh, okay.
you are not going to.
no no.
ya-bome!
she said "the third wheel is what makes it a tricycle." I am talking about your group date with megan and eric.
I am a screenwriter.
yes in a cup, we are not animals, dwight.
no... you are crazy.
but then again, who is?
stanley.
first victim, this is what i want you to do.
i know, it is okay.
well just as long as it means jim becomes a manager.
well, i would definitely have sex with ryan.
do not avoid this.
alright, I am going to, uhh, get a cup of coffee.
okay!
oh, ok. is that suppose to come off?
no!
can you believe that?
that todd packer can do anything.
uhghh, so i guess you know why I am here?
she is our international sales consultant.
thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation.
we are going to get you help.
merry christmas!
i know, it is a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!
no.
that is a little much.
me too.
that was weird.
and if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than i am.
type of-ocean spray.
who is this guy?
then ace.
right up my alley.
i do not think you froze.
no.
angela, you just got leied.
where great paper is our passion.
i got this out of a bin.
what are you doing?
i know you are all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption.
where is little man tate?
say hi to the kids.
um... no.
what?
i feel so weak, i just... what do you want me to do jim?
you guys... i will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue.
jimbo, last chance to carpool.
what happened to you people?
they call it that because of the electricity.
rumors.
i love it.
well i know what the rest of you are thinking.
you look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
what?
am i a small number person or a severance package person?
yeah?
you do not get to do your farming.
case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, i do not wannna get my head stepped on.
thank you very much.
this one's for you cherokee jack.
no cleaning up!
oh come on!
apology has been issued!
i do not have to, i just know.
did you know, that china has a new missile, that can sink a us naval carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
and they freak out.
well ultimately i went into business to inspire people.
well, then he is not a senator.
new and improved.
let us go help africa.
is jan there?
uh, you know what guys, we are just having a little office party, so if you want, uh... hey, you know, cool it guys, really- let us cut it.
alright.
what do you like best about pam?
are you kidding?
maybe to buy some printers, so... right here, we have the wonder twins, jim and pam halpert.
because, i thought we had the same birthday.
wow.
okay, pamela.
yeah, yeah.
where is my steeaaak?
like a grownup.
but, you will not tell anyone.
i would love a place where we could meet older <i>girls</i>.
this is luxery.
the ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger.
this place... is like... the hospital where i was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
that is not going to happen.
r-e-s-p-svee-t. find out what it means to me.
I am interviewing for a job at corporate.
baldy, your head is bald.
all i see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.
hey, hey!
although, i will agree that her head is weird.
what is diwali?
i had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
stanley!
who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
and he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he is kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit.
okay, no, that is not what we are going for.
uh... because it is nature.
a boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone.
no, but I am saying hypothetically if we were dating... well, roy is dead, and i ask you out.
oh.
you can do it.
let us go home.
just watch this.
it is quite literally a drug that speeds people up.
c'mon jim, let us go.
you put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.
i can not, i can not... i can not change anything.
just.
so that is why i made you this.
what kind of sauce is on your salmon?
I am trying!
because if you did i would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations.
they took away my parking space but they can not take away my pride!
no.
look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now.
happy, happy, happy, happy!
i will never give up.
i thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
I will be baaaaack!
right?
well,  hey pam, did you get that down?
yep.
i could help.
alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
man!
i wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when i got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them.
chillax, pam.
so, what is the solution?
yes.
thank you so much.
thank you.
and the reason i tell you this story.
thank you.
it is whoever, not whomever.
oh!
i did not like the trip.
halfway!
oh... she looks like an angel.
oh yeah, i bet it was fun.
i brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?
if you do not believe me, look in my gutters.
the chicken?
did not ya!?
what are you guys talking about?
i have to make some sales anyway.
used to be a window here.
we can not do this.
that was exactly what i was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that is a compliment.
you know what?
we saved a lot of lives that day.
listen, i can not make you laugh right now.
open your mouth.
this group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great.
i just... i just wanted to make this a day to remember.
no, no, no....
i do not have a second job.
so when i say I am sorry, it will be twice as effective.
i basically have the job already.
you earned it.
mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse... okay.
hello jo.
i have got big balls.
wow.
yes!
yes.
i do not, i do not think I am ready.
"schindler's list" parody.
"hey darryl, how is it hangin'?
met with jan, re: log.
yes, but i have an office, so why would i do that.
there he is!
what would you improve about dunder mifflin?
that is my mug.
i have ryan.
i want it to be a party that the guys in new york watch on the web-cam and say, "wow!
yeah.
and they would come down, and they would suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
all right.
hello ladies, how is my shower going?
okay.
i already have wine.
too far!
whoa, hey!
no evidence, no case.
oh well... what?
you know what?
albeit bored.
dwight is my friend.
i would do anything for them and they are just hanging me out to dry.
no, i was not, i did not cry- so my looks have nothing to do with it?
let us just clap.
no big deal.
you know what, you guys, you guys can get out I am going to soldier on a little bit.
get me!
of course not.
when i first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
i think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the michael scott paper company i really enjoyed having lunch with pam and ryan everyday.
I am not going to bump.
i just do not want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.
that is his profit.
you know what, i did not actually lose my keys... mmmmkay.
alright!
i. do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
start the party.
um... is it serious?
i have cpr training.
and people will never go out of business.
shhh!
here...  okay!
i- i have no words.
they are very, very upset with him.
something from the heart.
shut it.
i am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, oscar.
you know what?
these are shaped like paper.
mr. kosseli.
give him a guarantee.
no further questions.
actually, that would be a good salary for me, do not you think?
he gives the best back rubs in the office.
how about thursday?
good.
pam, michael scott.
thank you ryan.
andy had erin.
bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!
we have a crisis.
just forget it.
then i will name your team the red team.
alright, okay.
curly joe hitler.
go get her.
so stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
there is no way that happened.
you know what, i am on a deadline here and just, okay.
we... um... somebody has to stay here.
and dental this time.
it is a joke.
hey!
well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
well, i- thanks, that is my bed.
I am not going for bulk, I am going for tone.
see that?
phyllis and bob: their celebrity couple name would be phlob.
whooo... wish i had my cell phone, but i left it inside.
welcome to our humble abode.
love it.
that is what she said.
right?
penguin power.
if you are doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
what was the most inspiring thing I have ever said to you?
ohh.
do you remember me from last year?
not that they are not nice, or that have great personalities, they just... they just lack a certain... crawfordness.
good night.
i - ok. i know that you are mad at me and you are mad at all them - ok. alright.
who wants to watch michael's pond dive?
thank you very much.
alright!
you just did not think of it first.
scuse me!
just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
sorry you had to hear that.
i do not need to cheat.
no!
you are great.
how about this i throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' i lost my head when i fell in love with you.' it is easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school.
me?
well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, ryan.
uhh... hmm... okay.
do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?
could i ask you a question about women?
bears sad, worms happy.
stop.
deangelo is expressing himself.
so... thank you very much.
that is where you first met michael klump.
whoa, 'scuse me!
let us do it!
congratulations.
hello, everyone.
today we are going to team up for sales calls.
i think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
well you have to pick one or the other.
all of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
whoa!
that is not halloween.
get him out of here.
I have brought with me only the bare essentials.
this is your fault.
okay...  phyllis.
noooo!!!
I am sorry.
all right.
i know my rights!
okay?
sure!
they are totally gelling.
yummy, yummy.
missed you.
i was so nervous it was the wrong building!
so what does that say?
all right, let us count it down, like rockefeller center.
i will be tea baggin' it.
and make one tiny mistake, you are dead.
wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
pam!
do not hold back.
I will be down in a minute.
we do not seem to have a plan so I am thinking i go down there.
important show.
there is a raccoon in the car, dwight!
i think lozenge was the one who installed it.
lot of fire where you are going.
no, not right now.
i enjoy being liked.
idiot.
jim leave us.
ah.
i really do.
i read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever.
so, while she is here i am going to be acting kind of cold to you.
jan!
rodney dangerfield.
ryan, you are my son.
and that is why I am hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies.
no, not until i have some good news for them.
let us do it.
we are so alike.
I have already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
i wore woman's clothes.
i think you knew exactly what you were doing.
uh, got to love the 'bucks.
you can not.
it is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit meredith with my car.
i do not understand what he is saying.
wow.
okay!
they are into appearance.
but then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed.
and in paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
good.
...alright, so, raise your hand if you want to get rich.
pam, no, no.
very sweet... ah.
either one of them... excellent candidates.
oh really.
your ball and chain is right over here.
yes!
ok, alright, where is dwight?
how do i describe it?
did you ever think of that?
talkin' bout, uh, what?
you know why?
he is always up in my bidness.
for-okay, okay here is what I am going to do.
dang!
are you kidding me?
okay.
sorry.
damn it.
i do believe that the game is a big hit.
yeah, he is that good-looking.
are you... are you sick, oscar?
how much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
so...  psych.
yeah, i am.
i do not even... what is the point of that?
well i say that an empty desk means a... no, that is not... no, that is not what i was going to say.
you know what?
I am a homeowner.
oh i do not know, um, what if there is a tornado, pam?
because i do not make copies, I am the boss.
well, you are not a romantic.
nice to have oscar back.
you will never guess what i know.
I am michael.
hmmm.
uh, duh.
yeah, jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort.
it rained.
thank you.
yeah.
what has gotten into you?
uh... um, i think you will have fun.
on our way to new york.
yeah, way to go phyllis.
clothes.
who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work?
no, i insist.
I am in a very good place right now.
having to hug and kiss and spoon, i make them feel beautiful.
it is true.
wait, do we have until the end of the day?
i feel sorry for those people.
no way.
no, never heard of it.
when i wanted to see stomp, and you wanted to see wicked, what did we see?
the electric city.
this is one of our staff.
let the bells of dunder mifflin chime out your love.
that is a distraction.
you do not.
dude, keep it together.
good.
no... no... yeah.
toby killed this bird.
do not leave.
number one: you need to play to win.
and you know what toby?
when is that girl going to get married?
hey january not much, what is up with you?
the clothing was safe, but tasteful.
oh.
please do not let him leave.
what did it say?
okay.
ugh, that would be gross.
i am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
michael scott, as seen on tv.
let us go, pam.
thank you brazil.
i should have known.
but things are going well with carol.
and i have not been there in months.
we are not going to do it!
I am going to kill myself, and it is your fault!
ryan come here!
pervert.
negotiations are all about controlling things.
pam would have understood.
hi, jerry.
like having sex with jan- look, i am not a gazillionaire.
right.
have fun.
yuck.
because i could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.
not bad!
i think that i want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources.
so i do not think it is any of your business.
you are like our little man... beard.
warm up emotionally, all right?
i do not know.
yes.
now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever hank says goes.
you have changed, man.
teach her to offer stanley more money.
no, we can do it during the day.
why do you lie, liar?
ouch!
wow.
is that a contradiction?
so.. no it is not.
people have been filtering in and out.
be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
hey nice to see you again, aj.
this is my protege, jim halpert.
who let you in here, is what i want to know.
and any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that is me.
i worry about you.
this is the real world.
i am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then i take it to gabe.
improv class, i have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds- yeah.
second, i am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
the aye's have it.
nine dollars.
just what the doctor ordered.
yes, and hear me, dwight, when i say i brought you into this world, and i can take you out.
does not matter.
rule five - safety first,  i.e.
hi pam, how are you?
there we go.

smart broad.
classic brosnan.
oh... hey, hey.
you know what?
oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
mmm.
that sounds like a fantastic idea.
it is seems like ya did though- jim.
who is it?
right.
du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do.
jim!
so she says 'fine.
that is all I am, okay, here he comes.
place is packed.
we heard what you said.
interesting take on dorothy.
do not steal my joke.
you are playing like a bunch of girls.
i do not know.
I am going to forward it like it is hot.
and anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.
burning the midnight tequila.
but i learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or ryan would ever teach me.
bye.
it is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that is what i want.
they patch me through to his secretary.
become a really good friend.
but i never forget.
very good.
not super crazy... just... there is something about him that creeps me out.
yeah?
they are not.
and here we have "mister roger's neighborhood." come on over here.
ohhh!
i do.
well i would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
so maybe.
have you ever been to the circus?
sandwich platters.
bye-bye.
how about july 4th weekend?
uhhuhhuh.
dunder-mifflin, scranton is being shut down.

oscar will be in charge of accounting.
okay.
uuf, well... okay... why do not you just cool it, cool it dwight, please, god!
okay.
that is my girlfriend.
pammy?
moving to a new job can be very stressful.
what?
good news.
so... there is your barrette.
i forgot... i forgot... those are real cops, real guns.
you know what?
a.j.
because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.
how are you?
it is a big loss.
boom!
we found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when stanley had his... when his heart went berserk.
i do not want to work, i just want to bang on this mug all day.
there is a live audience out there!
very official.
you must not step outside of the ring.
yeah, but you are great now, right?
you know what?
hmm.
cold front coming into the warehouse.
cool.
old hatreds dissolve into new friendships.
i feel like I am dying inside.
no, me.
how are you?
i never want to make holly cry again.
coffee jim.
yeah... gosh.
pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
yes.
the guys i did not bring are even better.
would not that be fun?
see, because i need you... to keep me grounded.
nice butt.
you did not have to do that.
cons.
see how it is done?
there are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, jfk, aids, the holocaust.
it is... i wear it like that sometimes.
what are those stains?
I will just blow off the lecture at rochester.
i had a great time at prom.
yeah, I am here, i just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
i stepped in.
huhhhh, did you have johnny carson in your land?
look- oh my god... what do you want dwight?
um... oh, where is that?
let us see your penis.
mmm... well, let us keep this party movin' on.
well, that was not at all what i expected.
and it also helps if you have had five shots.
how about never hundred hours, sir.
deal!
you just press the button.
i am glad that today spurred social change.
gah, the dreadmill.
hey, pam yeah, i forgot what day the interview was and i drove to new york accidentially.
i love you!
toby is the anchor.
oh, great.
whoo!
where are you off to?
you want to be santa?
surprise endings.
hey pam.
we want the same things.
good, so, we are on the same page?
you are going to break something.
i think pam wanted to say something.
oh, and you.
raise your container to us and to sabre.
i can not see from here people.
ah, la, la, la.
oh okay.
when i am irritated and i look at you, i do not see you anymore.
in the meantime, i am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
i had no idea that there would be a second punch.
no.
it will last longer.
yeah, but no, seriously.
this  why would somebody throw that out?
do you want to talk about tonight?
how you doing?
when you know, you just know.
so many to choose from.
cafe disco!

I will just get up myself.
are you okay?
i can hear it in your voice.
maybe.
and I have decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
i will talk to her.
you guys are the best for coming.
i think what andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
and held him for ransom.
no.
what the hell is a terrarium?
what is that?
"i regret my actions.
probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
what did you get?
i have nothing.
captain jack sparrow.
ok, ok.  good.
all the real glee fans are going to go down the hall to the real glee party in the bedroom, follow me!
cutie-pie.
oh, do not start, you know what?
do not be.
ok, let us go, ladies of dunder-mifflin.
i do not know.
no.
people i respect, heroes of mine, would be bob hope... abraham lincoln, definitely.
busted.
i know.
final walkthrough.
because you know, kiddo, you quit.
that is a great idea jb.
maybe i should call him and tell him that.
what do you know about meredith?
there are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
that...hello.
so i said, "pop a claritin, and i will spot you the seventy bucks," and she is like "i do not like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication."  and I am like, "well you are really not going to like what i slipped in your drink last night." and she is like, "what the hell are you talking about?" and I am like, "I am kidding.
you know what, hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why ryan fired him.
is that clear enough for you?!
yeah.
works in accounting.
i think angela might be gay.
without further ado, ryan?
where is your saxaphone?
thanks dwight.
where he will then leave me to either die or to survive.
would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?
well, let us see.
so i am instituting prima nocta.
right?
alan brand is the ceo of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to new york to the shareholder's meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors.
including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a ouija board... ohhh!
like a beach blowout?
oh, thank you my dear.
you two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
that is how you do it.
okay.
thank you.

alright.
idiot.

but he is married to her!
old fashioned raid.
yeah?
ah, i knew it.
good, okay.
okay, I am calling the police.
he... does his family know?
i was afraid i would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
he would....fall down.
nice try, how is your pollack-says-what index?
hi.
ohh, darryl.
what is jim telling him?
oh, good.
i do believe you have me mistaken, my name is caleb crawdad.
okay, you know what.
they are in a whorehouse.
i am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.
ryan?
oh!
because it is very scary stuff.
the fat accountant award.
monkey see, monkey do.
thanks.
well you know what?

wowwwee, look at that!
stanley!
even though she... makes me.
jim it is okay.

uh-huh, yes, i can do that.
everybody gets dumped gabe.
I am not a shark.

uh, successful.
more personnel turnover.
it is michael.
michael scott.
two not-so-great things in a row.
um, no, no, no.
give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself.
all right.
what?
come on!
he would still look good.
hello, pam.
jim, you are in charge of the vacation schedule now.
you must not touch the ground.
we are soul mates.
you wearing a thong?
you get to look at her.
um, here is the deal.
ew, okay, all right.
because "oh, i regret that."  but, "wait, I am still going to call you."  but, but, "we are just going to talk business.
brrr!
my proudest moment here was not when i increased profits by 17% or when i cut expenses without losing a single employee.
hey jim.
it will be fine, i just...wish people were going to be drunk.
i saved a life.
good luck.
m. night shyamalan.
all right, so, on your mark, get set, go.
she is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office.
and everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.
give me a good firm... ooh!
i do not know if it is going to work, but let me give it this.
is why.
no.
can you read that back to me?
that is not cool.
so you are the lawyer, mr. of'malley?
i feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other.
did you ever experiment with other women?
how 'bout the suggestion box?
i- mmm- I am good.
dwight.
1,2,3- what are we going to do?
why do not you ask if darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
yeah.
there he is.
let me feel that.
hey dwight.
i think it is talking and being friends, and jim thinks it is moving to connecticut and being best friends with josh.
and it was not even his birthday, but i heard about it the next day in school.
i want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads.
i know.
alright.
it is like a slang for starbucks.
it is okay with me but he is going to want me in there.
no, no, no!
this is going to be a very good year.
battleship got me through my parents' divorce.
stop!
i did not say anything!
all right, everybody, take a seat.
what?
sleep with who?
so our tragedy is your good luck.
thank you, pam.
okay, okay.
who knew devon was so popular and had so many friends.
the women, the pancakes, the man of mystery... meredith, i would like you to pretend that you are from abu dhabi.
What are you got?
that probably had something to do with the camera work.
welkommen, bienvenue, and welcome to monte carlo!
that is creepy.
it feeds my soul.
yes, i can.
you know why they call me prison mike?!
in business, image is everything - andre agassi.
that is our building... and we sell paper.
mmhmm.
you know, how they say take a chill pill?
it is like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "hey, man, i love you this many dollars worth." no, do not!
ok, press conference in 45.  dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
i am the guy who roused that crowd.
it would look good, on my mantle.
because of him, the british left india, and then he became an actor like ronald reagan.
karen, do you need to go pump?
fine, i took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.
good work today, everybody.
no.
you know what i was thinking might be sort of fun?
i... thanks.
because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on saturday.
phyllis, oscar, ryan, who is supposed to be dead, can i ask you all a question?
here.
because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
there was wind.
up and over.
be my eyes.
calling cards are... the wave of the future.
god!
would you cool it?
he is a liar.
no I am staying.
the streamers?
he wears glasses.
come on, anybody.
you understand.
i talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff.
no.
i am going to go get laid.
is it, is it because you are afraid of where this is going to take me?
oh.
uh-huh?
yes i do.
it is about us all.
that is the way you should enter a room.
you never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.
i am such a stupid idiot.
no, you may not.
that was-- that was a-- that was a really good choice.
turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar.
i need to know... who shot johnson!
well, if that is the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
alright?
good luck.
what about this cash for clunkers thing?
yeah.
but she is in the hospital, she is fine, recovering nicely.
why does the sun rise in the morning?
you know what it means.
or drive the bus.
i love pad thai.
i will probably find out tonight.
daaah, let us just run away together.
all right.
beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.
ry-an.
pam, are you my friend?
ah, i need my entourage  jim.
but, um... yeah.
nnnngah!
go ahead.
god!
whatever.
welcome!
the sex is not nearly as good as it used to be.
right there.
answer over to the question.
still, i think there might be something wrong with january no need for consternation, everything is under control.
actually, it was-no, it was when i heard her voice.
... and i feel free!
ryan, coffee.
hello.
i kissed.
this is an important day.
it is not a big deal really, i just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, i picked up her glove so i was hoping i could give it back to her.
okay.
do not do what i say, say what i do.
no.
a little bit of paaam, all night long, a little bit of angela on the thing... ...a little bit of phyllis everywhere... ...a little bit of roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of jim with some ribs, a little bit of... will her highness, jan levinson-gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at dunder mifflin scranton?
just get out!
so i have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers.
so, I have got my new york girl and my local flavor.
do not think she is going to make it - many women <i>are</i> competent drivers.
and frankly, I am a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
yes, andy.
scranton!
just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and i do not know.
jan went crazy.
i have a convertible.
it is right in the middle of the paper belt.
what is that guy talking about?
who is pat?
like a sulfur deposit under here?
okay, listen up all you dunder-mifflinites!
kind of, yeah.
ah.
six-shooter?
that is... ...kind of  maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
toby, katy.
come on.
sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard.
come on.
that is not a very nice thing to say about him.
i want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.
yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened arctic chill back there.
i know.
there you go.
oh... it is ... yeah ... no, no, no!
it was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times.
and, um, it is uncomfortable.
you know what?
we are all homos!
you know what the only thing i want for christmas?
everybody!
spoil the surprise.
there he is!
i know.
umm... leave it at reception.
i like this.
yeah, it will be good.
oh, i know what you are thinking.
you know what?
they are back?
I am giving them the leads, phyllis.
now, i am going to talk with you.
mmm-hmm.
everybody in here.
my mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month.
I will pay for the party.
no, i think it is- yep.
it is really incalculable.
well, at least you are still being honest with me.
good thing it is working.
do i know a carol stills?
oh, yeah.
and that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
thanks for coming.
he can not fire all of you.
uh, they look that good?
i think an investor's ski trip is the best idea.
pam?
i would like an xbox, and a tv that is compatible with an xbox.
luke, come on.
they would say things like "do not pay for six months" or "you can transfer your account from another card"... do you think I will get any new ones?
or did you forget?
thank you.
i do not understand it, but you do not get to understand everyday of your life.
uhhh it is ridiculous.
come on.
i have been testing you the entire day.
one of the new people, please?
yeah?
nice catch.
all right!
eighty-seven years young.
mmm, sure, but could i first talk to you in my office?
nothing really.
oscar martinez.
stanley, are you having an affair?
blue jeans, the grand canyon.
what?
do you want to talk about?
very messy.
i do not tell you how to do your job, do i?
and right now it is all rat and no tat.
no, what did you say?
we think a lot alike.
i... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.
talk to me face.
this thing with holly feels a lot like love to me.
right?
you want me to pick you up anything?
for you, consider it cow-meat.
go around, start doing the heimlich.
i like this chair.
alright, well, cool.
okay.
where is he, pam?
i can do that.
like i was a murderer or something.
let us go!
what?
yes.
okay, let us get personal for a second, shall we?
check out the cathedral ceilings.
the grownup by the base?
too personal.
if you need to vomit, that is ok. i did.
please, not at a time like this.
I am sick of the cocky walk, i am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, i am sick of your uppity attitude, jim... i think i am not going to give these to you.
you call your friends "retards" when they are acting retarded.
... with coffee but without the haunted.
hey.
get up.
i will not touch yours, by the way.
every night, a different woman.
and she still is.
all right, see you guys down there.
what do you need?
ohhhhh... why so you can do it?
oh my god, would not that be hilarious!
that is what she said.
apart from abolishing slavery?
see ya!
okay?
halpert, room d1.
am i the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
how you doing?
what is wrong with you?
i think she is gorgeous.
go back to the annex.
i am worried.
actually, it is valentine's day.
i got us tickets to sandals, jamaica, we leave day after tomorrow.
what is it?
anything can happen at the dundies!
i want to keep those so i can see what i sent.
"it is ryan the wuphf guy!" "he is up there." look at that!
i could talk about boobs.
what the hell is going on?
i heard it that time. ]
a bunch of  them.
did i make more of what we had then what was really there?
adios!
these are human beings.
me too, me too.
whatever i write here has to be really, really funny.
thank you very much, thank you.
just do it.
please!
that is it?
i said stop.
thank you.
no... no.
oh, hi.
for you, job well done.
come on, come on.
better!
ah, none.
stop it stop it!
i win.
it is illegal.
you know what might be kind of fun?
no no no.
what, I am, totally being serious.
nope.
centerfold in the catholic schoolgirl's outfit?
gotcha!
there is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any sabre printers.
i guess i never thought about it that way, though.
a shame to waste these.
well we  should make a list.
oh, that is them!
oh no no, I am not picking on you at all.
all right.
let him walk across these coals.
oh, man!
we are not the terrorists.
thank you very much.
oh, no, no, no.
yeah.
did you have a good weekend going there?
ok, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I am going to have you all in tears.
symphonies do not have any money.
people expect a lot from these meetings.
it is insane!
but the good thing about the american dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
I am a catch and i am not going to be the one who got away.
divorce.
okay.
you know what?
wish us luck.
no, we-no.
if this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle... you did not have any of the potato salad did you?
you know, it is funny.
ty, i would like you to crunch those numbers again.
oh, no problem.
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right!
I will be back.
he did.
no!
yeah, I am trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days.
i do not even know, first-name basis!
and that really inspired me.
hi, is it over?
but, i think i want to do those things myself.
ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
a squid's eye or... how did you... people hate people that are different from them.
do not like that.
I am proud of you.
we should find him!
to save time, jim.
i did nothing.
hello little boy, what is your name?
not yet, give it time.
oh, man, would i love to go head-to-head with him.
same places as last week.
dwight and i are going out.
listen to me, you are not doing this for me, you are not doing this for you, you are not even doing this for them!
yes, um, jim.
scranton!
nice!
mmhmm, tell her she can not have sex for six months.
very serious.
there you go.
I have fallen and i can not get up!
my name is michael scarn.
I am not saying that is what he said.
we are going to be doing some darts, we are going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.
well, it was actually me alone, so- wow look at this place.
man became civilized for a reason.
i do not know.
it is... it is one of those two.
good.
we are going to the hospital and we are going to have a baby.
better keep the... frat boys away from her.
angela, what is the score?
...ish.
come here.
your turn, you have to go.
here we go.
no, no, it is great.
they are going to have nightmares, so why do not you just shut it?
it is okay, just we will not judge you.
thank you.
alright, that is the way you want it.
i put stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.
but you know what?
they were the most fun.
oh.
get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every monday for the next seven mondays.
who else?
i have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place.
mmhmm.
he is not.
okay, okay.
and you guys are the mother and daughter.
okay.
you have just lost my business.
they are nifty gifties.
not that i would be lying per se.
he was emotionally unavailable.
we will auction off people like in the olden days.
sailors are on water.
listen up.
he can heal leopards.
okay.
well, do not do that.
do not talk to me that way!
show of hands.
birthday party subs!
that is a piece of cake.
if i just went away right now, would that be the best gift that i could give you?
yeah, that is smart.
yes.
i could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
bend at the knees.
like trying to find the camera, to give the camera a look.
you know what this is like?
I am sorry.
man.
oka- okay!
grab you here.
i blew this.
so, i felt i needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and I am making him do my laundry for a year.
you went over my head to wallace!
although the new car is a porsche.
you bet.
that was not scripted.
he did?
do you know what the f. stands for?
alright .
well, i hope you are right.
I have always wanted to be in the witness protection program.
ok. alright.
no!
never, ever, ever give up.
i need somebody to pick a card.
so... so it is not the same thing.
come on!
mom, I am going to have to call you back.
where is my cornbread?
oh, my god.
bam.
what?
the old michael scott might have taken this, but not the new michael scott.
... what?
come on in.
so... we all agree to get new chairs then.
I have never seen this place in the daylight.
I am very successful... your coworkers look at you differently.
hoo hoo!
acting!
okay.
they are good food, good meals, good lunch.
i used to think that she was the one.
dun-der.
it is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.
emotionally and sexually and... orally and i am not used to relationships going this well.
my emergency contact is todd packer.
we will talk more about that on the boat.
good.
oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good.
what?
sign please.
ronnie was bleh.
... i am really proud of you.
third wheel.
there is no stanley tree.
i cannot tell you how i plan to escape.
top of the sunday morning to you.
mmm-hmm.
no... you know what jim, this is not about me anymore.
ryan is doing my intro right now.
unless you want me to.
shall we proceed?
just felt like taking it off.
we will find that out together.
thank you, ryan.
