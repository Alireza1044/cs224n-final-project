all right jim.
your quarterlies look very good.
how are things at the library?
so you have come to the master for guidance?
is this what you are saying, grasshopper?
all right.
well, let me show you how it is done.
yes, I would like to speak to your office manager, please.
yes, hello.
this is michael scott.
i am the regional manager of dunder mifflin paper products.
just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger.
all right.
done deal.
thank you very much, sir.
you are a gentleman and a scholar.
oh, I am sorry.
ok. I am sorry.
my mistake.
that was a woman i was talking to, so... she had a very low voice.
probably a smoker, so...  so that is the way it is done.
I have, uh, I have been at dunder mifflin for 12 years, the last four as regional manager.
if you want to come through here... see we have the entire floor.
so this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see.
this is our receptionist, pam.
pam!
pam-pam!
pam beesly.
pam has been with us for...  forever.
right, pam?
if you think she is cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.
any messages?
oh!
pam, this is from corporate.
how many times have i told you?
there is a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
it is called the wastepaper basket!
look at that!
look at that face.
people say i am the best boss.
they go, "god we have never worked in a place like this before.
you are hilarious." "and you get the best out of us."  i think that pretty much sums it up.
i found it at spencer gifts.
whassup!
whassup!
whass...up!
what?
ok. all right.
see you later.
back to work.
corporate really does not really interfere with me at all.
jan levinson gould.
jan, hello.
i call her hillary rodham clinton.
right?
not to her face, because... well, not because I am scared of her.
because I am not.
but, um... yeah.
um... me no get an agenda.
i did not get any agenda.
really?
i did not...  did we get a fax this morning?
why is not it in my hand?
a company runs on efficiency of communication, right?
so what is the problem, pam?
why did not i get it?
yeah, that was a joke.
that was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... it was supposed to be with bills and it does not work great with faxes.
yeah, yeah.
lovely.
thank you.
ok... no, no, no, no, this is good.
this is good.
this is fine.
excellent.
all the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
ok. no problem.
me no want to hear that, january because downsizing is a bitch.
it is a real bitch.
and i would not wish that on josh's men.
i certainly would not wish it on my men.
or women, present company excluded.
sorry.
uh, is josh concerned about downsizing himself?
not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
question.
how long do we have to...  oh uh, todd packer, terrific rep. do you mind if i take it?
oh, that is not appropriate.
uh, i do not know what you mean.
oh, my god!
oh!
that is... horrifying.
horrible.
horrible person.
no, absolutely.
under this regime, it will not leave this office.
like that.
am i going to tell them?
no, i am not going to tell them.
i do not see the point of that.
as a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
hey.
guilty!
guilty as charged!
howard, like moe howard.
three stooges.
watch this.
this is moe.
nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck.
mee!
ah, right here.
three stooges.
oh, pam.
it is a guy thing, pam.
I am sort of a student of comedy.
watch this.
here we go.
I am hitler.
adolf hitler.
relax.
everything's under control.
uh, yeah.
yeah.
that is important.
right.
oh this is so important, i should run to answer it.
come on.
six-million dollar man!
steve austin!
actually, that would be a good salary for me, do not you think?
six million dollars?
memo to january i deserve a raise.
I am sorry?
if you are unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with hr.
ok. not today, ok?
pam, just be professional.
i think I am a role model here.
i think i garner people's respect.
attention all dunder mifflin employees, please.
we have a meeting in the conference room, as soon as possible.
people i respect, heroes of mine, would be bob hope... abraham lincoln, definitely.
bono.
and probably god would be the fourth one.
and i just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it is really beyond words.
it is really incalculable.
now i know there is some rumors out there and i just kind of want to set the record straight.
assistant to the regional manager.
I am about to tell everybody.
I am just about to tell everybody.
you do not know what it is.
i do not need your permission.
corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me.
and jan is thinking about downsizing either the stamford branch or this branch.
not going to happen.
it will not be out of my hands stanley, ok. i promise you that.
no.
well, yeah, it is a promise.
and frankly, I am a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
i know.
hold on a second.
i think pam wanted to say something.
pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
well, pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
no, stanley.
no, you did not see me in there with her.
i said if corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they are going to have to go through me.
right?
you can go mess with josh's people, but I am the head of this family, and you are not going to be messing with my chillin.
watch out for this guy.
dwight schrute in the building.
this is ryan, the new temp.
introduce yourself.
be polite.
assistant to the regional manager.
so, uh, dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
that is his profit.
ok. hold on, hold on.
the judge is in session.
what is the problem here?
what is that?
no, no, no.
do not take it out.
you have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which i hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
discipline.
kinky!
all right, here is the deal you guys.
the thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
and yeah, jim this is the time to stop putting dwight's personal effects into jell-of.
nice.
that is the way it is around here.
it just kind of goes round and round.
hey!
yes!
new guy!
he scores.
pudding.
pudding... I am trying to think of another dessert to do.
so have you felt the vibe yet?
we work hard, we play hard.
sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard.
right?
i guess the atmosphere that I have created here is that I am a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.
just a second.
right?
oh, hey do you like the jamie kennedy experiment?
punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
you are going to be my accomplice.
just go along with it, ok?
just follow my lead.
do not pimp me, all right?
come in.
so, uh, corporate just said that i do not want to... oh, thank you.
pam, can you come in here for a sec.
just have a seat.
i was going to call you in anyway.
you know ryan.
as you know, there is going to be downsizing.
and you have made my life so much easier in that i am going to have to let you go first.
why?
well, theft and stealing.
post-it notes.
50 cents, yeah.
if you steal a thousand post-it notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you have made a profit... margin.
you are going to run us out of business, pam.
yeah.
i am.
but the best thing about it is that we are not going to have to give you any severance pay.
because that is gross misconduct and... just clean out your desk.
I am sorry.
you been x'd punk!
surprise!
it is a joke.
we were joking around.
see?
ok. he was in on it.
he was my accomplice.
and it was kind of a morale booster thing.
and we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place.
so you... god, we totally got you.
i do not know about that.
what is the most important thing for a company?
is it the cash flow?
is it the inventory?
nuh-uh.
it is the people.
the people.
my proudest moment here was not when i increased profits by 17% or when i cut expenses without losing a single employee.
no, no, no, no, no.
it was a young guatemalan guy.
first job in the country, barely spoke english.
he came to me, and said, "mr.
scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" wow.
wow.
did not work out in the end.
we had to let him go.
he sucked.
yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on pam.
messages?
</p> curly?
very good.
curly joe derita.
well, comedy's kind of my thing.
watch this, here is curly joe.
mmm.
me, me, me, me, me, me.
me, me, me, me, me, me.
oh, i forgot.
here we go.
I am hitler.
right.
me, me, me, me, me, me.
curly joe hitler.
</p> oh, john belushi.
what a crazy guy.
phew, freaked myself out this morning.
yeah.
i thought i found a lump.
i checked the, uh... i check the jewels every month.
this time... you know, it is a little different.
it was fine.
it was fine.
but freaky, man, you know.
testicular cancer, god.
cancer, whoa testicles.
so... what is, um... what you eating?
oh, place around the corner.
nice.
all right.
see you later.
</p> hey, uh, can i help you out in here?
gotcha.
good.
I would go with the rows.
that is a good idea.
today is diversity day and someone is going to come in and talk to us about diversity.
it is something that I have been pushing, that I have been wanting to push, for a long time and corporate mandated it.
and i never actually talked to corporate about it.
they kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards.
but i was going to.
and i think it is very important that we have this.
I am very, very excited.
hey, oscar!
how are you doing, man?
did you have a good weekend going there?
oh yeah, i bet it was fun.
oh, hey!
this is oscar-- right.
see?
i do not even know, first-name basis!
oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let us do it.
oscar works in... here.
jim, could you wrap it up, please?
it is diversity day, jim.
i wish every day was diversity day.
come on people, let us get  them in.
get in the cards!
get in the cards!
you know what?
this is a color-free-zone here.
stanley, i do not look at you as another race.
exactly, were not... with tolerance.
ignorance.
let us celebrate.
celebrate good times.
come on!
let us celebrate diversity.
right?
you know what?
here is what we are going to do.
why do not we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually.
i will go last.
go.
yes.
ok. hey, hey why do not you run it by me and I will run it by him.
ok. why do not we just defer to mr... ah.
oh, right!
ok. first test.
i will not call you that.
how come chris rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then i go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to corporate?
is it because I am white and chris is black?
i will play the chris rock guy.
i would like to see someone else pull this off.
ok, i will play guy listening.
ok. kevin is a great guy.
he is a great accountant.
he is not much of an entertainer.
ok. I am sorry.
I am sorry.
he is ruin... he is butchering it.
could you just let me...  every time... every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  i take care of my kid!
they always want credit for something they supposed to do!
what you want a cookie?
i do not think i can sign this.
well, ok, it says here that i learned something and i knew all this stuff already, so... i know, i could sign something that says that i taught something, or that i helped you teach something, so... pam!
where is she?
pam, could we change something on this?
sure.
here is the thing.
this office, i think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it is probably more advanced than you are used to.
that is probably throwing you off a little bit.
ok, well i know.
you told me that several times.
ok. well, here i am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training.
and you do not.
i will not.
yeah, yeah.
"i regret my actions.
i regret offending my coworkers.
i pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." open-mindedness, is that even a word?
"...into the workplace.
in this way, i can truly be a hero.
signed, daffy duck."  he is going to lose it when he reads that.
"i pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." i do believe... in that part of the pledge i that just read.
but a pledge?
come on.
i mean who are we, the girl scouts?
no.
look... the guy, "mr.
brown," he got us halfway there.
he got us talking.
well, no.
i got us talking.
he got us nothing.
he insulted us and he abandoned us.
you call that diversity training?
i do not.
were there any connections between any of us?
did anyone look each other in the eye?
was there any emotion going on?
no.
where was the heart?
i did not see any heart.
where was my oprah moment?
ok, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I am going to have you all in tears.
all right?
everybody pretty?
come on.
here we go.
it is time.
let us do some good.
get out.
no, this is not a joke.
ok?
that was offensive and lame.
so double offensive.
this is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here.
ok, let us go.
let us do it.
come on.
let us have some fun, everybody.
here we go.
take a seat.
cop a squat.
and um... thanks for coming in.
um... diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I have always said.
but do not take my word for it.
let us take a look at the tape.
hi.
I am michael scott.
I am in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton, pennsylvania but I am also the founder of diversity tomorrow, because today is almost over.
abraham lincoln once said that, "if you are a racist, i will attack you with the north." and those are the principles that i carry with me in the workplace.
ok. questions?
comments?
anybody?
jim?
yes.
i only had an hour to put it together but I am going to add on to it later on.
uh, yes.
that probably had something to do with the camera work.
anybody else?
um... yeah, well, if you leave we will only have two left.
yes.
enjoy.
absolutely.
namaste.
ok, well since i am leading this, let us get down to business and why do not i just kind of introduce myself, ok?
um.
i am michael and i am part english, irish, german and scottish.
sort of a virtual united nations.
but what some of you might not know is that i am also part native american indian.
two fifteenths.
well, you know what, it is kind of hard for me to talk about it.
their suffering.
so who else?
let us get this popping.
come on.
who is going?
who is going?
let us go here.
oscar, right here.
you are on.
oh, yeah... wow.
wow.
that is... that is a great story.
that is the american dream right there, right?
um, let me ask you, is there a term besides mexican that you prefer?
something less offensive?
well, it has certain connotations.
like... i do not... i do not know.
no.
now, remember that honesty... ...empathy, respect...  jim!
jim!
i have something here.
i want you to take a card.
put it on your fore... do not look at the card.
i want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... take a card, take a card, any card.
um... and i want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead.
ok?
so everybody has a different race.
nobody knows what their race is, so... i want you to really go for it, because this is real.
you know, this is not just an exercise.
this is real life.
and... i have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly.
get 'er done.
why?
because martin luther king is a hero of mine.
there is this great chris rock bit about how streets named after martin luther king tend to be more violent.
I am not going to do it but it is... oh this is a good one.
push it.
good.
bom bom bom-bom bom.
come on olympics of suffering right here.
slavery versus the holocaust.
come on.
no, that was inadvertent.
we did not actually plan that.
pam, come on.
"i like your food." come on stir the pot.
stir the melting pot, pam!
let us do it.
let us get ugly.
let us get real.
you will notice i did not have anybody be an arab.
i thought that would be too explosive.
no pun intended.
but i just though.
"too soon for arabs." maybe next year.
um... you know, the ball's in their court.
ok. all right.
no.
it is good.
you just need to push it.
you need to go a little bit further.
all right.
ok. kelly, how are you?
oh!
welcome to my convenience store.
would you like some googi googi?
i have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax.
try my googi, googi.
try my googi, googi.
try my googi, googi.
try my... all right!
all right!
yes!
that was great, she gets it!
now she knows what it is like to be a minority.
i just hated it when that guy was in here.
mr. brown, if that was his real name.
i mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing.
i just wanted... i just wanted to do it our way.
you know?
on our own.
man i should have gotten some food.
okay, kevin.
you can take that off that thing, ok?
that would really, really have shown him up, would not it?
if I would brought in some burritos or some colored greens.
or some pad thai.
i love pad thai.
what?
that does not really make sense.
because you do not call them collared people, that is offensive.
hmmm... ok, well, it is after five.
so... thank you very much.
buena vista oscar.
thank you.
good job.
oh, my man.
thank you brazil.
nice.
yeah.
i would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.
no, the country.
yeah, more like a 1,000. i just think that hero?
it is cute, but it is... it is empty, you know?
it is easy.
dwight, you know what, i came up with some terms of my own.
could you put these on the board?
the first one is inclusion, new attitudes, color-blind... expectations....
thank you.
sharing... and tolerance.
well, it is not ideal but you have to give me some credit because i made it into a word.
i will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually.
okay, first, incest is bad.
racism is bad.
no brainer, right?
two, incest.
we are all a family, right?
we are all brothers and sisters.
racial message?
um?
number three, and this is a fact.
the states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest.
okay?
and finally... no, no, no, no, wait.
final one, final one this is important.
the more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.
okay.
I am sorry, I am sorry this guy's a temp and i should have told you that.
yeah, but no, seriously.
uh, you know, he is not a member of the full staff so, uh, ryan you want to just step outside?
well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot.
you know what.
yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots.
cool?
because the handicaps get a raw deal.
oh, you know what.
that ties right into new attitudes.
new attitudes about handicap people.
very important.
should i... turn, no.
do it again.
hi.
I am michael scott.
I am in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton, pennsylvania but I am also the founder of diversity tomorrow, because today is almost over.
abraham lincoln once said that, "if you are a racist, i will attack you with the north." and those are the principles... damn it.
okay, sorry.
do not laugh; please do not laugh this time dwight.
you are... it is, it is bugging me.
let me give myself a countdown, ready?
three, two, one.
just let me do it!
god!
three, two, one.
hi.
I am michael scott.
I am in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton... keep the camera steady please!
people are going to get sea sick watching this.
ready?
three, two, one.
do not.
please do not say anything.
oh, god.
could i count myself down please, dwight.
three, two, one.
hi.
I am michael scott.
I am in charge of dunder mifflin paper products here in scranton, pennsylvania but I am also the founder of diversity tomorrow, because today is almost over.
abraham lincoln once said that, "if you are a racist, i will attack you with the north." and those are the principles that i carry with me in the workplace.
talk like you are talking to that race.
i have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile.
so keep it going.
oh, okay.
here we go, breakthrough radar.
what happened?
what happened here?
okay, all right.
let us keep on track.
keep on point.
let us do it.
try my googi, googi.
try my googi, googi.
try my googi, googi.
try my...  all right!
all right!
yes!
that was great, she gets it!
kelly thank you.
she is not here, but she gets it.
that is what we have been looking for.
the whole time.
oh, man.
this is what i thrive on.
you know?
it is like don rickles on acid, man.
right?
what, huh?
it is good.
this is good.
we got it happening now.
all right?
let us keep it rolling.
let us round it up.
pam.
pamela.
pam-elama-ding-dong.
making copies.
let us go.
messages.
stat.
lots to do, lots to do.
information superhighway.
lay them on me.
what?
that is not what you said earlier.
the most sacred thing i do is care and provide for my workers, my family.
i give them money.
i give them food.
not directly, but through the money.
i heal them.
today, i am in charge of picking a great new health care plan.
right?
that is what this is all about.
does that make me their doctor?
um... yes, in a way.
yeah, like a specialist.
i am going to go with the best, january i am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
i think it was you who did not look closely enough at the gold plan.
well, I would recommend it.
it is very good.
you got to crack these things open.
well, that is kind of a tough assignment.
um... it will not be popular decision around the old orifice.
well, it is a suicide mission, you know.
there, there... when have you ever done that?
jimbo!
ha haaaaa.
ah.
there is a decision that needs to be made, and I am having an unbelievably a busy day.
so I am going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
yeah!
really?
ah, none.
you are picking a health care plan.
you can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
nope, you cannot use it.
temporary workspace.
you can use it.
if dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance.
and if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than i am.
i groomed him.
i made him what he is today.
unless he fails, and we have talked about that already.
pam, michael scott.
how is tricks?
oh, i am in my office.
i am swamped.
i have work up to my ears I am busy, busy, busy.

wow, dwight, did you make cuts?

i said nothing specific because i was so busy.
why do not you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them?
ok?
ok?
all right.
do we feel good?
all right.
good.
plus, there is some other good news.
today, at the end of the day, i will have, for all of you, a big surprise.
ok?
so hang in there, and i will see you at the end of the day.
right?
do i know what the surprise is?
hell no!
it does not matter.
the point is, they are not unhappy anymore.
they are out there thinking, "wow, my boss really cares about me.
he has a surprise.
he is cool.
i... what a great guy.
i love him.
i... <i>love</i> him.
you know what?
come with me.
we are going on a little mission.
operation surprise.
um, headed out.
part of my busy day, you know.
meetings.
could not find the knob.
so, basically, i want to do something nice for my employees.
atlantic city, ok?
they have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free.
picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
i did, so... calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend.
um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost.
and i was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
its says here that it is a 300ft drop.
so it is not a free fall?
uh, all right.
well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
ok, so i do not know what the surprise is.
am i worried?
no.
no way.
see, i thrive on this.
this is my world.
this is improv.
this is whose line is it anyway?
hey, hey, everybody, ice-cream sandwiches!
aaaahh!
here you go.
take one, take one.
it is all good.
phyllis, think fast.
ya-bome!
oh, oh, i see angela.
angela?
right?
waaaaah!
oh, hey temp.
why do not you take two?
because you do not get health care.
and uh, faster metabolism.
why do not you just eat it, ok?
and here you go, stanley the manly.
there you go.
uh, nope.
nope.
this is not the surprise.
it is surprising, um... because you did not expect it.
but you will... you will know it when you see it.
oh, christ.
well, what?
you could be referring to anything.
uh, dwight?
did you raise benefits?
oh come on!
that is horrible!
aaah... thanks, dwight, for a crappy plan.
ah, damn!
oh, mmm, i wish i had time to change it, but jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?
ah, it is after five.
oh, oh it is awful.
so, well, ok. see you guys on monday.
oh... yes.
exactly.
thank you angela, for reminding me.
terrific.
um, before i tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
all right, i have some news for you.
there is a big surprise.
and... here it is.
here we go.
and the big surprise is... brrrrrrrr!
drum roll... brrrrrrrr!
brrrrrrrr!
when i am backed into a corner, that is when i come alive.
see i learned improve from the greats, like, um, drew carey and ryan stiles.
god, yeah... ah!
this... robin williams.
oh, man, would i love to go head-to-head with him.
oh!
that would be exciting.
"hi.
I am mork from ork." well, I am bork from spork.
nanoo, nanoo.
jibelee, baloobaloo.
sorry, too busy can not even come to the door.
yeah, no... you know what.
i, um, I am out the door.
I am going to a meeting.
pam, I am headed out to another meeting.
so see you later.
uh, here we go.
hey, hey craigers, my man!
it is michael scott here.
dunder mifflin, we supply your office paper.
no, no, no, no.
no, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend.
um, here is the deal.
um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost.
and i was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride.
well, it says here that it is a 300ft drop.
so it is not a free fall?
uh, okay.
so um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do?
is it like, uh... do you have laser tag down there or something?
that is it?
uh, he is a small client.
they do not really buy much.
we are all going bowling!
oh!
god.
dwight, come on... there is no downsizing.
assistant to the regional manager dwight.
look, look, look.
i talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff.
and they said they could not guarantee it if there is downsizing, okay?
but there is no downsizing, so just do not... mmm, mm, mm.
maybe.
it looks like there is going to be downsizing.
and it is part of my job, but... blah!
i hate it.
i think the main difference between me and donald trump is that, uh, i get no pleasure out of saying the words, "you are fired."  "you are foir-ed.
uh, you are foir-ed." it just makes people sad, and an office can not function that way.
no way.
"you are foir-ed."  i think if i had a catchphrase it would be, "you are hired, and you can work here as long as you want." but that is unrealistic, so... get set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott.
now, i think i have had a little stroke of genius in that i have had my assistant pam... smile, pam.
i have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it.
not bad, not bad at all.
all right.
and the birthday person is... drum roll please.
here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
who is it?
who is the birthday?
next person on the... ...calendar.
yes!
all right, come on down meredith!
um... uh, ok. well, great, well, you know, it will be a surprise.
yeah, why not?
sure.
go ahead, live a little.
come on, pam.
come on, shake it up.
shake it up!
shake it up!
brrrp!
uh, spock, are there any signs of life down there?
well, let me check captain.
eeee.
eeee.
eeee.
eeee.
no, captain.
no signs of life down here.
just a wet blanket named pam.
brr-rrrp.
star trek.
these are my party-planning beeyatches.
pulled off an amazing '80s party last year.
off the hook!
so i was thinking, if you have not already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from baskin-robbins.
those are very good.
very delicious.
she is not the only one that is going to be eating it, right?
i think everybody likes ice-cream cake.
it is not, uh, it is not just about her, so... mint chocolate chip!
that would be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
can you get her?
she is right there.
that is meredith, the birthday girl.
and this... is meredith's card.
happy bird-day.
um, let us see.
jim, jim wrote, "meredith, i heard you are turning 46, but, come on, you are an accountant.
just fudge the numbers." not bad, pretty funny, i do not appreciate condoning corporate fraud though.
uh, here is the thing.
whatever i write here has to be really, really funny.
because people out there are expecting it.
I have already set the bar really high.
and they are all worried about their jobs, you know.
it is kind of dark out there.
can you imagine if i wrote something like, uh, "oh, meredith.
happy birthday.
you are great.
love, michael." meredith, meredith... meri... mary had a little lamb.
mary... meredith had a little lamb.
do not bring that lamb to work or it will poop on the floor.
hey, oscar!
come on in.
what is up?
oh, not at all.
come on in.
what is going on?
what?
oh, god.
of course i would.
get it over here.
get that over here.
no, I am always good... for some serious buckage.
wow.
two dollars, three dollars?
people out here do not care about diseases.
i am going to give you... $25.
oh, my gosh, well... listen, oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale.
that is what i say, so... meredith, bad breath.
meredith has bad breath.
yeah.
what do you know about meredith?
there is not going to be downsizing dwight, ok?
i just, i need to know a little bit more about my friend.
i know all that.
i know all that.
i just, i need something kind of embarrassing, you know.
kind of fun, inside.
which one is that again?
oh god!
dwight, no.
I am trying to write something funny.
what am i going to do with a removed uterus?
you know what, i am on a deadline here, and just... ok. thanks, thanks for your help.
I will work it out.
thank you dwight.
that was a waste of time.
almost there.
just a sec.
just a second.
it is perfect, thank you.
excellent, here we go.
it is time, thank you.
ok, come on.
let us go!
get the cake.
here we go.
come on!
shhh.
be quiet.
it is surprise meredith.
one, two... find a key.
and many more!
you were surprised, were not you?
you looked freaked, man.
we said "surprise." you were, like, "what?" "what the hell's going on here?" good cake.
why do not you have some?
come on.
a little bit.
oh, right.
god, too bad.
it is so good.
you know what?
if i were allergic to dairy, i think I would kill myself.
because this is way, way too good.
jim, good party, huh?
just a little something i whipped up.
you know, a little morale boost.
no big deal.
well, you know, money is not everything jim.
it is not the key to happiness.
you know what is?
joy.
you should remember that.
maybe you will give more than three dollars next time.
is oscar around?
i just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation.
i did not think it was per mile kind of deal.
you know, so... i know... right.
got it.
yes.
so it does.
um... no, no, no, no, no.
that was not what i was not, that was not... no.
it-it-it is not about the money.
it is just... it... it is the ethics of the thing, oscar.
how is your nephew?
is he in good shape?
how many miles did he do last year?
son of a bitch.
that is impressive.
read it out loud.
and say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
i do not know about that.
huh!
thanks, downer.
because of the downsizing.
rumors.
and because you are gettin' old.
you did not get the joke.
so, that is cool.
that is, you know what?
actually... i have a bunch of these, good ones, that i did not use.
um... oh, where is that?
oh, ok, here is a good one.
um... "hey meredith, liz taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." because meredith's been divorced like, twice.
is that right?
divorce.
um... ok, "meredith is so old..." everybody?
if... could do it?
"meredith is so old..." "she is so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her." that was not even mine.
i got that off the internet.
website.
um, do not get mad at me.
this is not my fault.
ladies, not your best effort.
the streamers?
i think we could have done better than that.
ok, we... all right.
people, hold on, hold on.
just a second.
ok, i think we are losing sight of what is really important here.
and that is that we are... a group of people... who work together.
i was... i really was not going to flaunt this.
i have made a very sizable donation to oscar's nephew's... walkathon.
$25.
per mile, yes.
when i retire, i... do not want to just disappear to an island somewhere.
i want to be the guy who gives everything back.
a check for the kids, and for the team.
i want it to be like... "hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "um, well, i do not, i do not know.
it was anonymous." "well, guess what,  that was michael scott."  "but it was anonymous, how do you know?" "because I am him." come here.
do not cash that till friday, ok?
all righty then, well i see you are going for the whole bored supermodel thing.
"dunder mifflin, this is pam.
may i help you?"  smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
no, no.
i get it, i get it, i get it.
a child is born, "oh, oh-hum." a beautiful sunset, "no, I will catch the next one." right?
unicorn walks into the office, "oh, do you have an appointment?"  okay, look pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you are doing wrong.
you are the voice of this company, right?
and when clients call and you are not smiling they can hear that in your voice.
it is a real turnoff.
yes, i am, absolutely.
so, the next call we get I would like you to smile.
I would like to see a big smile.
okay.
i know, somebody will.
and we will wait.
i know, i know, we will wait.
we will wait for the call and you will smile.
let me try something, just while we are waiting.
tell me if I am smiling or not.
hi pam, how are you?
was i smiling?
okay, let me try this one.
hi pam, how are you?
i mean you can tell.
i was not smiling that time and they can tell too.
thank you.
all right, when we get a call I will come back and you will do the smile.
show time!
it is show time!
okay.
no, not at all come on in.
no, no.
you can not.
no, red hair is my area.
we have it on tape, so... i was going to put that in my message, toby.
all right?
so just cross it off.
cross it off, now.
what are you doing?
oh come on, you are ruining it.
toby, come on.
just, look at that.
that is wrecked.
ass.
get some white out.
that is my white out.
get your own white out.
just... what is the matter with you?
god.
okay, um, there was a girl from dunder mifflin.
who had a big, puttifflin.
mifflin, spifflin.
hey.
uh, yeah.
what do you know about meredith?
there is not going to be downsizing dwight, ok?
i just, i need to know a little bit more about my friend.
i know all that.
i know all that.
i just, i need something kind of embarrassing, you know.
kind of fun, inside.
which one is that again?
oh god!
dwight, no.
I am trying to write something funny here, okay.
what am i going to do with a removed uterus?
come up with a joke that i can use, okay?
help me out here.
no, not a uterus joke dwight.
please.
something useable.
a joke.
what?
there is not going to be downsizing, dwight.
you know what, i am on a deadline here and just, okay.
thanks.
thanks for your help.
I am... I will work it out.
thank you dwight.
thanks for coming in, that is always... always helpful when i give him a call.
call him in.
i know.
ugh, that is so annoying.
brain fart.
by the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I have forgotten about?
just, you know we  bumped into each and you said, "brr, brr." and i went, "argh, argh." you know?
anything?
well, if you think of something, let me know.
because i like to know.
because I am going crazy.
no, no.
i know you did not intend to, but i just i got the idea and i, uh, i just do not it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something.
you know?
and then prey on their emotions.
no, hey  it is just kind of uncool, okay?
i, just... play fair, you know, play fair.
thank you.
because of the downsizing.
rumors.
and because you are gettin' old.
you did not get the joke.
so, that is cool.
that is, you know what?
actually... i have a bunch of these, good ones, that i did not use.
um... oh, where is that?
oh, okay, here is a good one.
um..."hey meredith, liz taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." because meredith's been divorced like, twice.
is that right?
divorce.
um... okay, "meredith is so old..." if everybody... could do it?
"meredith is so old..." "she is so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her." what is the difference between meredith and michael jackson?
michael jackson's surgery was unnecessary.
yes!
thank you.
god.
she gets it.
we just picked the best one right?
just had it.
um, no, no.
come on.
no.
do not comfort... do not comfort her, that is not... she does not need comforting.
we are just joking around.
i think she is... no that is very unprofessional.
i think she is being very unprofessional over there.
: hey, you ready?
all right, all right, secret sign.
hey, ryan.
very good.
excellent, excellent.
today at lunchtime we are going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball.
my idea.
last time i was down there, i noticed they would put up a couple of hoops, and i play basketball every weekend.
so i thought, "this might be kind of fun."  and so i started messing around and... I am sinking a few, you know.
swish, swish, swish.
nothing but net.
and their jaws just dropped to the floor.
african-americans!
so... you know, it is really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
pam, pam, thank you madam.
messages, please.
thank you.
no.
and that is not me being mean, dwight.
that is based on your past behavior.
when i let him come to my pick-up game... i vouched for you.
i vouched for you in front of todd packer, dwight.
all right, here is what I am going to do.
the hand strikes and gives a flower.
you are not going to play basketball.
but i need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
good.
excellent, it will be fun.
because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on saturday.
and so we are going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and i know nobody's going to want to do it and i know everybody's going to complain and bitch and i do not want to have to deal with that.
yes it is.
assistant to  the regional manager.
no, it is not.
it is lower, so... all right, managing by walking around.
this is our warehouse.
or, as i like to call it, the whorehouse.
but do not you call it that, I have earned the right.
and here we have "mister roger's neighborhood." come on over here.
hey, this is ryan.
he is temping upstairs.
and this is the foreman.
mista ra-jahs.
no, it is darryl.
darryl is mista ra-jahs.
and that is lonny.
and this is roy.
roy dates pam.
you know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
you still getting it regular man?
huh?
i mean, i can tell her it is part of the job!
rapport!
so, um, one of the clock sharp and we have got a game on.
oh, i see, you are chickening out on me.
you are bailing on me.
oh, well, I am glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I am down here it does not seem too busy to me.
oh, oh.
you can dish it out, but you can not take it.
ok, fine, have it your way.
all right, see you at one.
are we ready for the game?
i... yeah, yeah.
i know, grumble, grumble.
but you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way.
like that, uh, dwarf from lord of the rings.
nerd.
that is why you are not on the team.
uh,  "I will help, elwyn dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword." ok, so, let us put together a starting line-up, shall we?
stanley of course.
um, what do you play?
center?
uh... uh, i do not know.
i do not remember saying that.
well, people hear a lot of things, man.
um... other starters... me, of course.
i heard it that time. ]
um... yeah.
who else?
we have jim.
we have ryan, the new guy, right?
untested.
willing to prove himself now.
a lot of passion, a lot of heart.
yes.
yes, this is business.
the, uh, business of team building and morale boosting.
uh, who else?
i will use your talents come baseball season, my friend.
or if we box.
no.
no, no, ridiculous.
close.
all right, uh... me, stan the man, jim, ryan and dwight.
sorry phyllis.
no, I am team captain.
no, i am the team manager.
you can be assistant to the team manager.
no.
jim, you are in charge of the vacation schedule now.
threat neutralized.
off the backboard!
oh, pam with a zinger.
hey, pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today?
you know, some, ah, pigtails?
a little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up.
and you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change.
just this once?
yeah, i bet you would.
just try not to be too gay on the court.
and by gay i mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all.
i mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way.
i think that goes without saying.
oh, yeah right.
oh, yuck, that is worse than you playing.
... because we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt.
that is where we need you.
blessed be those who sit and wait.
you made it, suit up, you are on the team!
all right, cool!
very good.
oh-oh.
oh-oh.
a spy from the warehouse.
trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
oh ho, oh, he is running.
he is running.
he is running, but he can not hide because you know what?
one of the clock, you better bring your 'a' game.
because me, and my, posse guys are going to be in your face.
right in your face!
whoa-ho.
i like the way you think.
you know what, I am going to take that one step further.
loser, works, on saturday.
what?
ok. cool, you are on.
do not screw this up.
classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game.
hey, there he is!
secret weapon!
all right, guys, come on, let us bring it in!
here we go!
ok, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right?
we are all on the same team here, the dunder mifflin team.
of course, if you beat us, you are fired.
that is a joke.
ok, let us do it.
all right, everybody stretch out a little bit.
stretch it.
full stretch.
ryan, you want to stretch?
ok. ok, ryan, you have darryl.
i have roy.
actually, i think roy is their best player not lonny.
so, dwight, you uh, have the east german gal.
uh, who else we got... um...ok, all right, you guys.
aw, come on dwight.
on.
just put it on.
yes.
uh, pam?
you kind of have your foot in both camps, why do not you do the uh, jump ball ok?

it is gone, I am in the zone.
what is wrong with me today?!
who am i?
am i michael scott?
i do not know... i might just be a basketball machine.
what is dunder mifflin?
I have never heard of it.
filing?

possible downsizing?
um... well, that is probably going to happen, actually.

ryan, cut!
whoa!
that is cool.
is that like the robot?
nice!
come here!
come on!
hey, dwight.
dwight!
you know what?
dwight, dwight... football is like rock and roll, it is just bam-bam-boo... and basketball is like jazz, you know?
you are kind of... dupee-doo, dupee-do.
it is all downbeat, it is in the pocket, it is like...  dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah... du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do.
du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do.

right there.
yes, it was.
you know what, I am just being fair.
game over.
game over.
that is it!
I am sorry, you know?
i hate to do it this way but, you know, that is just... we are having a friendly game.
it is a shame.
this is a damn shame, but we are like a family here and that just, that will not fly.
thanks dwight.
well, let us just say whoever was ahead won.
it was us?
really?
i did not, i did not know.
great, i mean, i guess you guys are working saturday.
your face.
um... well, you guys, you know, I am the boss so... hey, hey... you guys believed me?
come on.
dogs, you know, you should know me better than that.
no, oh, do you think that would have been good for morale?
no.
no.

exactly, no.
I am embarrassed it was even that close though.
so... nah, of course, we are coming in saturday.
good game.
word.
hey, what a game, huh?
what a game.
come on.
let us not be gloomy here man.
we are all in this together.
we are a team.
you know what?
screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow.
you have the day off.
like coming in an extra day is going to prevent us from being downsized.
have a good weekend.
the great thing about sports is that it is all about character.
and you can learn lessons about life even if you do not win.
but we did because we were ahead.
uh, yes.
thank you for noticing.

they did this great profile last month of doris roberts and where she likes to eat when she is in phoenix.
illuminating.
this is my conference room.
so please, uh, make yourself at home.
whatever you need, I am right on the other side of this wall.
used to be a window here.
there is not anymore.
so, that is where i will be.
so if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just do not hesitate to ask.
I am right here.
wait a second.
i should have spotted another addict.
uh, got to love the 'bucks.
it is like a slang for starbucks.
they are all over the place.
oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me.
what a business model too.
ah, too bad we do not have the good stuff here.
nah, it is not.
it is spppplllibbb no, here is the thing.
y'know i do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they are always putting up walls and I am always tearing  them down, just breakin' down barriers, that is what i do all day.
so a coffee, regular coffee for you.

yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah.
techno-babble.

not that we are all millionaires.
I am probably closest.
so here is oscar.
oscar, this is katy.
oooh-ooh.
oscar the grouch.
right?
i thought of that.
i know.
i know.
i made the connection.

i know, it is unbelievable.
here is toby from human resources.
katy, toby.
toby, katy.

a thousand big ones.
yes.
this is a starbucks digital barista.
this is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
oh, i know what you are thinking.
you are not prying this out of my hands, but do not tempt me because I will give it to you!
coffee is the great incentivizer in the office.
it is a drug.
it is quite literally a drug that speeds people up.
it is not the only drug that speeds people up.
you hear stories about dunder mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was.
guh.
man, did they move paper!
oh the rotating um, steam wand.
what?
what is the matter?
oh, oh!
god.
I am sorry.

nearby?
because i can give you a ride.
seriously.
no, really.
god!
no, no, no, no.
no inconvenience.
i mean I am out of here at five sharp.
i can go earlier.
because I am the boss.
you know, whatever.
I am out of here slaves.
what?
okay.
sounds good.
sounds good.
five of the clock sharp.
i will give you and your purses a ride home.
excellent.
great.
cool.
cool.
yeah, okay.
i should have never let the temp touch this thing.
i had all these great icons and now i have four folders.
so.. no it is not.
because i could just click on the icon and then I am onto-- no, no, no it is not against the rules.
she is not a permanent employee so it is not.
but i think you should just know that i am going to be giving her a ride home later.
she asked me for a ride and so i am going to give her a ride home.
well, might be a ride home.
might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot... no.
i cannot promise you that.
listen, dwight.
dwight, no.
i do not know.
it is too early to tell.
i do not know how i feel.
espresso?
you are welcome.
thank you.
hmmm-hmm-hmm.
ummm-hmmm... very easy to clean.
okay.
like he is going to win anyway, right?

thoroughness is very important in an office and... yeah, yeah, of course.
uh, pam, one more thing.
um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
ryan.
would you like to help me with a special project?
alright.
okay, just throw out all the empties.
um, yes.
throw them away in the recycling bin.
no.
uh, what flavor?
blue's not a flavor.
oh, blue blast.
yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened arctic chill back there.
i want that in the passengers cupholder.
thank you.
what, stop!
whoa!
that is my drakkar noir.
no, it is a perfect smell-alike.
I am not paying for the label.
right here.
give it.
not it is not, there is some in the straw.
there, now you may throw it out.
that is over several months, ryan.
i think in order to be a ladies man, it is imperative that people do not know you are a ladies man, so i kind of play that close to the chest.
i do not know, what can i say?
women are attracted to power.
and i think other people have told me that i have a very symmetrical face.
i do not know.
i do not know.
maybe they are right?
i do not know.
sure you do not want me to help you with that?
because i can grab that no problem.
see you later.
goodnight.
goodnight, jim.
where you going?
with us?
okay.
great.
off the hook.
excellent.
okay, cool.
alright, have fun.
do not drink and drive.
take it easy.
you too, have a good night.
do i have a special someone?
uh well, yeah of course.
a bunch of  them.
my employees.
if i had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow i pick-up in a bar, and these people?
I would pick them every time.
because with them, it is an everyday stand and i still know their names in the morning.
dwight.
dwight.
dwight!
okay, that is it.
keep it in your pants.
well, do not do that.
where are your glasses?
he wears glasses.
did you know that?
well, now suddenly he can see.
okay, take off.
see ya.
bye-bye.
there you go steaming hot cup of joe.
oh, i know your hero.
yeah, saving you from animal planet jack over there.
yeah, yeah he is the worst.
right, but 20 years ago we could not and that is amazing.
here is toby from human resources.
this is katy.
toby, katy.
toby's divorced.
god, that is hard.
that really ripped you up.
she got the kids right?
that will damage ya.
sorry man.
that is uh, that is a bad one.
how much you paying her?
what can, you can not even afford anything now, right?
you are all right though, right?
do not ask me for a raise.
cup of soup's a good idea though.
that will... that is a good budgetary thing to do.
well, they are good snacks.
they are good food, good meals, good lunch.
roman noodles are good too.
you still sleepin' in the car?
because he slept in the car a couple times.
are you still taking the antidepressants?
because it was a good idea.
because it will help.
it will help, man.
okay.
I will see you in a bit.
she is pretty cute is not she?
see you in a bit.
ah, i know, everything really.
i love it all.
i love music.
yes, i love both of those so much.
a lot of  them.
mmm hmm.
i like  them.
yes.
god.
they are awesome.
uh huh.
yup.
that last thing they did was great.
cool, so maybe hook me up  with some fleebulls and some hive.
all right.
this is going to be good.
tonight is the dundies, the annual employee awards night here at dunder mifflin.
and this is everybody's favorite day.
everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here do not get trophies, very often.
like meredith or kevin, i mean, who is going to give kevin an award?
dunkin' donuts?
plus, bonus, it is really, really funny.
so i, you know, an employee will go home, and he will tell his neighbor, "hey, did you get an award?" and the neighbor will say, "no man.
i mean, i slave all day and nobody notices me." next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house.
neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition.
so... hey hey hey!
it is fat halpert.
fat halpert.
jim halpert.
so why do not i take you on a tour of past dundie winners.
we got fat jim halpert here.
jim, why do not you show of your dundies to the camera?
oh, that is a good idea.
gyaaah.
t.m.i.
t.m.i my friends.
t.m.i.?
too much information.
ah, it is just easier to say t.m.i.
i used to say "do not go there" but that is... lame.
and here we have stanley the manly.
now stanley is a dundie all-star, are not you stan?
why do not you, ah, show them some of your bling.
oh, no you di-int.
w-why did you... yes we should.
i... you know what?
i wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when i got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them.
to oscar martinez it is the "show me the money" award!
yeah!
he has the award-ah!
...it is a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies.
hit it, dwight!
a little bit of paaam, all night long, a little bit of angela on the thing... ...a little bit of phyllis everywhere... ...a little bit of roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of jim with some ribs, a little bit of... will her highness, jan levinson-gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at dunder mifflin scranton?
well, you could take the bus.
you could work on the way here.
sleep on the way home.
wuh... come on, january this is important.
i mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this.
so... um... could you...?
yeah, I am here, i just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
um, what, ah, what is, i mean... ...come on, jan!
you are dropping an a-bomb on me here.
well, yeah, i mean, what is... no reason?!
it was the 05 05 05 party... ...it happens once every billion years.
okay, no, that was a fun raiser.
i think i made that very clear in the fliers, fun, f-you-n. well, i think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
this is a little character i like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on karnack, one of carson's classic characters.
here we go.
the plo, the ira, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse.
"name three businesses that have a better health care plans than dunder mifflin."  here is the problem.
there is no open bar because of jan and it is the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum.
it will be fine, i just...wish people were going to be drunk.
the dundie award for "longest engagement" goes to pam beesley.
pam, everybody!
whoooo!
when is that girl going to get married?
that is what i have to say.
ah, roy's accepting.
thank you roy.
are there any words you would like to say, on pam's behalf?
yeah, oh, hope not!
oh god!
I am not changing that, it is the best one.
that is why it is funny.
every year that roy and pam do not get married, it gets funnier.
oh,  lazy.
uh huh.
yes.
okay, well, that is just ridiculous, so just do not, i-i do not have time for this right now.
just do not, do not talk- do not talk- just stap it yap it!!!!
okay, look, i know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the dundies this year.
how there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but what the hell everybody!?
i mean, god.
the dundies are about the best, in every, one of us.
can not you see that?
i mean, okay, we can do better.
so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
yeah, not bad, right?
so let us make this the best dundies ever.
"the dundies, how can i explain it?
awards you like to hate it.
I am psyched you all made it.
you never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.
you are just a name and number and no one even says hello."  card!
"you down with the dundies?
you down with the dundie-" alright, alright, joke landed.
so we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 dundie awards.
i am your host, michael scott.
and i just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive.
because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we are going to be doing separate checks.
i did.
and why did not ya stanley?
well, I am looking forward to meeting terri.
shut it.
um, good.
speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms.
um, i was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from hr, dwight.
no, that...for the sake of the story.
and things were getting hot and heavy.
and i was about to take her bra off... ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork- no!
god.
alright, so let us get this party staaaarrrrted.

yeah, way to go phyllis.
nice work, per usual.

I am going to cwall jan revinson-gould.
oh, dat wir be fwar.
ah, me so horny.
right?
you know wat I am talking 'bout.
this next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.
somebody, who i think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out.
the "hottest in the office" award goes to... ...ryan the temp!
yeah.
"hidy ho, you sexy thang.
you sexy thang you." here you go.
and the "tight ass" award goes to angela.
not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose.
so...come on down.
the "spicy curry" award goes to our very own kelly kapoor!
get on up here.
here you go.
um, not everything means something, it is just a joke.
i do not know, it is just... i know.
it is ju- they did not have any more businessmen.
so... just sit down kelly.
it is so freakin' hot in there.
now i know what bob hope was going through when he performed in saudi arabia.
man!
i got dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do.
here we go, he is early with the cue.
here we go.
"you have won a tiny dundie." hey, thanks guys.
hey, where you guys from?
oh, alright, yeah.
uh, you know what guys, we are just having a little office party, so if you want, uh... hey, you know, cool it guys, really- let us cut it.
i had a few more dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I am just going to cut it short.
and wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food.
um...thanks for listening, those who listened.
this last dundie is for kevin, this is the "do not go in there after me" award.
it is for the time that i went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly.
so... there you go.
alright, alright, alright, okay.
alright, we will keep rolling.
okay, this is the fine work award.
this goes to stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.
you know you did.
and this next award is going out to our own little pam beesley... ...i think we all know what award pam is going to be getting this year.
it is the "whitest sneakers" award!
because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
get on down here!
pam beesley ladies and gentlemen!
oh, here we go.
pam beesley ladies and gentleman.
oh!
thank you.
was this year's dundies a success?
well, let us see, i made pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck.
so i killed, almost.
great work tonight.
excellent.
yes, that too, but i mean with the audio.
great work.
what do we know about him?
he is an accountant.
he is fat.
the fat accountant award.
here he is.
really?
what did they say?
"for a good time, call michael scott"?
why do you think that?
you just immediately go to that, dwight?
why are you so negative?
why... i mean, you just come in and you are just negative... ...and you just walk negatively.
do you want me to find out what it says?
yes.
what does that even mean?
what are you... what are you talking about?
just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me.
but do not tell anybody that i have anything to do with it because if they ask me, i will say that you are crazy.
thank you.
you will not regret this, michael.
i had not planned on including him.
kevin.
well, what should i do, guys?
seriously, do you want me to just cancel the dundies?
ping?
everybody loves ping.
he is my most popular character.
really?
well, he is based on the chinese delivery guy that i have, who talks exactly like that, so, i think you should take it up with him instead of me.
well, neither of you are chinese, so what... why do you care?
what?
dwight, you have hit a new low here.
that is a good point.
okay, all right, i will do that.
i will get to that definitely.
absolutely.
oh, i do not know.
maybe after i finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show.
all right, just relax, keep your pants on.
unless, of course, you are in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without creepsville central spying on you.
good.
you down with the dundies?
you down with the dundies?
you down with the dundies?
you are all my homies you down with the dundies?
yeah, all the homies i have listened to that song so many times and i still do not know what opp stands for.
other people's... something.
i... he is hot, all right?
what do you want me to do about it?
it was unanimous, toby.
well, okay, i based it on what i felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this is not even about what ryan thinks.
it is about you.
it is about how you feel about the dundies.
admit it.
yes, it is true.
okay, i do not have time for this.
i need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration.
me chief michael scott.
here to trade... absolutely.
is this mine or is this chili's?
keep it.
my gift.
thank you.
have a good night.
see you next year.
hey, what is up?
any emails today?
no?
um... check your spam folder.
what?
kay.
i am king of forwards.
it is how i like to do business, everybody joking around.
we are like 'friends'.
i am chandler and joey and, uh, pam is rachel.
and dwight is kramer.
that is funny!
that is funny.
not offensive.
uh... because it is nature.
educational.
um, i... yeah... maybe.
maybe.
well, we will see.
because i... i do not know if it is...  whup!
come on!
hey!
kay!
oh, you are so bad!
yeah!
oh, boom!
bam!
oh, this guy is out of control!
he is a madman!
better get the bleep button ready for him.
uh oh.
uh oh!
oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-of!
todd packer and i are total bff.
best friends forever.
he and i came up together as salesmen.
one time, we were out and we met this set of twins.
and packer told them that we were brothers.
and so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought them back to the motel.
and then packer did both of them.
it was awesome.
so... oh-whoa-oh!
oh!
okay.
grade 'a' gossip for you, right now.
randall, cfo, resigned.
nobody knows why.
really?
here we go!
buckle up.
it is going to be a bumpy one!
oh, yeah.
well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there is a lot of dumb people out there.
oh!
wow!
i did not say it!
i did not say it!
oh, wow!
what did i tell you about the bleep button.
oh.
bad boy.
um... ryan?
ah!
man.
that todd packer can do anything.
hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video.
I am going to forward it like it is hot.
forward it like it is hot.
forward it like it is hot.
"old school".
yes, toby?
um... literally two seconds?
toby is in hr which technically means he works for corporate.
so he is really not a part of our family.
also he is divorced so he is really not a part of his family.
no, no, toby.
no.
it is a big deal.
it is a big deal!
what are we supposed to do?
scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day?
i mean, come on!
what?
no!
what?
he!
no!
okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us?
to not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
there is no such thing as an appropriate joke.
that is why it is a joke.
everyone!
hello!
everyone.
hi!
sorry to interrupt.
i know you are all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption.
but toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.
so, take it away.
i wish you luck, toby.
i really do.
but you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and i just can not wait to see how you handle it.
a guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs.
so, the next day he goes back to complain.
and the woman says "hey.
it was only five dollars.
what did you expect?
lobster?" this is what is at stake.
time to bring out the big guns.
I am heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born.
find a killer joke that will just blow everybody away at the seminar later.
and remind them what is great about this place.
so... ah!
here they are.
guys!
wondering if i could, uh, get your help for something.
I am looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer.
and it does not need to be clean.
so What are you got?
um, yeah, no, well... i mean better.
better than that.
the type of stuff you guys tell all day.
alright, alright.
well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
oooh, okay.
that was still about me.
what?
i do not feel bad.
no, i do not.
okay.
well, not exactly what i was looking for but thanks guys.
thank you.
hi, is it over?
no.
i know, i know.
it is good.
it is not over.
it is not over til it is over.
did he tell you everything?
obviously, he did not because you all still look relatively happy.
albeit bored.
do you realize what we are losing?
seriously?
exactly!
mmwwah !
can we afford to lose email forwards?
do we want that?
give me a break.
umm... stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk?
centerfold in the catholic schoolgirl's outfit?
i mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on.
and i will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it.
but what?
are we just going to take it away?
i think the old honor system was just fine.
for example, i have never slept with an employee.
and, believe me, i could have.
no!
no!
catherine.
remember her?
remember how hot she was?
she would have definitely slept with me.
yes, she was.
dammit, kevin!
what if pam was a lesbian?
what if she brought her "partner" in to work?
would that be crossing the line?
what if they made out?
in front of everybody?
at home?
and i told everybody everything about it.
okay.
well, then let us act it out.
pam, you will be girl a and girl b will be... okay!
we will use the doll.
pam.
pam?
i wish todd packer was here because he would love this.
i wonder if anybody else would like to do this.
hey!
um... we have to watch, uh, toby's video that he is showing us in order to brainwash us and i was wondering if anybody would like to join in?
going to be fun.
got my great pizza.
whataya say?
jim?
that is what she said.
pam?
that is what she sai   nope, but... okay.
well, suit yourself.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... okay!
hypocrite!
she is a hypocrite.
that is such a scam!
okay.
okay, you are never going to believe this.
the girl in the video we are watching that corporate gave us... darryl banged her!
aaand is about 90% sure.
so you are the lawyer, mr. of'malley?
i know a lot of lawyer jokes.
well, it is probably because you do not get  them.
when i said before that i was king of forwards, you got to understand that i do not come up with this stuff.
i just forward it along.
you would not arrest a guy who is just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
the problem is that i am the boss and apparently i can not say anything.
where is the line?
where is the line, january no, I have seen the video.
no, i did not.
huh, what?
attention, everyone!
hello!
ah, yes!
i just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends.
and when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.
and, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy.
and in the future, if i want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, i will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
mmmhmm.
yes.
that is what she said!
come on.
mwah!
you would have done the same.
you just did not think of it first.
it is... that is... okay.
hello.
january mr. of'malley.
this is my lawyer, james p. albiny.
i believe you may recognize his face from the billboards.
he specializes in free speech issues.
this guy does it all.
what?
so I am not in trouble?
i am so used to being the bad boy.
i am so used to fighting corporate that i forget that i am corporate.
upper management.
they hooked me up with an attorney.
to protect me.
you can not be too careful about what you say.
mo' money, mo' problems.
okay.
well, let us get you out of here, james.
um... i think we are under an hour still, so... i know.
we will talk about it later.
thanks for coming in.
no.
no, no, no.
that crosses the line.
not you.
kevin.
just unwarranted.
hostile work environment, kevin.
no.
you said it.
he pointed.
a point is not a say.
look.
kevin, we are a family here and phyllis is a valued member of that family.
like a grandmother.
i do not know about that.
well, i have a late birthday and usually september's a cut-off point.
you know what?
you just crossed the line.
okay?
there is a line and you went over it.
and you must be punished.
so go to your corner.
yes, your corner.
go.
mmmhmmm.
they did not get to me.
i got to them.
i am still the same old michael scott.
new and improved.
you know what?
i love phyllis.
you know what else?
i think she is gorgeous.
i think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.
c'mere, c'mere, c'mon!
come on!
come on.
oooh!
I am not worried.
you know what?
the only thing I am worried about... is getting a boner.
good work today, everybody.
times have changed a little.
and even though we are still a family here at dunder-mifflin, families grow.
and at some point, the daddy can not take a bath with the kids anymore.
i am upper management.
and it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with pam.
as much as i might want to.
what is going on?
what?
i do not get what you mean.
well, you said i looked thin, so what does... does that mean I am like thin weird or thin handsome or... yes, well, of course.
of course.
no, but I am saying hypothetically if we were dating... well, roy is dead, and i ask you out.
you say yes, and we go out.
and now roy and pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, toby.
I am an early bird, and I am a night owl.
so I am wise, and i have worms.
oh, breakfast.
yummy, yummy.
thank you, ryan.
um.
the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit.
but thank you.
and why do not you take a couple hours.
the office is yours.
"home alone," "risky business." take your pants off, run around.
whatever you got to do.
ok.  healthier.
got to watch those carbs.
today, i, michael scott, am becoming a homeowner.
investing in real estate.
yes it is.
yes it is.
it is very important to own property.
back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they would throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
maybe.
yes.
yes.
final walkthrough.
sign the papers at the condo.
uh, i do not need one.
i do not need a representative.
no, no.
no.
dwight.
I am fine.
well, this is not about work.
this is closing on a condo, it is completely personal.
except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, i need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
ok. fine.
yes, you can come.
as my associate.
no it is not.
oh, most honorable pamera.
not offensive, because that is the way they talk in movies.
we are.
dwight and i are going to the big thing.
so why do not you have everybody work on their expense reports and I would like them in by the end of the day.
very good.
we will.
um, did you do the thing i asked you to do about the magazines?
good.
the small business man?
maxim?
american way?
cracked?
how about, uh, fine arts?
aficionado monthly?
no, well can you get on that, because i do not just read cracked.
thank you.
ok. see you soon.
i do not know, regular.
normal ones.
nothing fancy.
not my style.
what are you doing?
what?
no, dwight.
it is fifty degrees outside.
do not... please... i... just... would you put it up?
ok. fine.
just leave it down.
whiner.
i do not understand what you spend your money on.
home, sweet home.
right there.
my sanctuary.
my party pad.
someday i can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here.
hang a swing from this tree.
push them back... wait...  no, it is this one, right here.
home, sweet home.
oh, how are you?
nice to meet you, bill.
bill.
mr. bill.
ohhh nooo.
mr. bill.
ohhh!
snl?
when they pull him apart?
he would always get rolled over by something.
nice to meet you too.
yeah, small.
I am buying it and I am not renting it.
so, it is still an upgrade.
he does not know anything about property ownership.
kind of an idiot.
um.
oh.
good.
that is good.
it is good to be accommodating of that.
this, my friends, is the master bedroom.
check out the cathedral ceilings.
those are like seventeen feet high.
we have cable readiness.
right there.
i am going to totally pimp this place out.
i am going to put a surround sound system.
i am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
I am putting my bed right over here.
well, then i will get a warrantee.
well then i will not get a warrantee.
so that is the problem, is solved.
what?
uh... ten year.
what?
wha?
you said ten.
ok, ok, ok. alright.
ok. alright.
oh boy.
um.
oh.
oh, ok. is that suppose to come off?
um.
I am going to take a little breather for a second.
excuse me.
oh, man.
uh.
the ceilings are lower than they were last week.
that, i do not... i do not... ...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
where are all the hot people?
i was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
as far as i can tell, I am the best-looking person here.
there is a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development.
it is just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you have no place to go but down.
no, no, no.
i am not going to rent the third bedroom.
i want a price reduction or i am a-walkin.
ehhhh....
i made the right decision.
I am glad i signed.
I am a homeowner.
right?
good to be a homeowner.
diversifying.
this is good.
this is fun.
we are having fun.
there is something else dwight wanted to talk to you about.
i have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
no, no.
i insist.
i insist.
because you have really done some great work.
great work.
and that is why, i am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
why did i do it?
because i believe in rewarding people for their efforts.
ah.
i rewarded dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
I am thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we will go month to month after that.
or, until i start dating, have a girlfriend, then you are, you know, you are gone.
what the hell is a terrarium?
oh, so an aquarium.
ah, that will not come into this place.
we take separate cars.
why would we do that?
no.
ehhhhnt.
game over.
offer revoked.
dwight.
I am sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens.
this is what i get.
oh god.
I am ... ok. yeah, well, you know what?
nobody cares about your stupid beet farm.
beets are the worst.
nobody likes beets.
nobody likes beets, dwight.
why do not you grow something that everybody does like?
you should grow candy.
I would love a piece of candy right now.
not a beet.
stop it!
yeah.
jim.
slim jim.
what is going... what is going on?
oh.
thanks.
thanks.
it is very cool.
it is a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
you know.
really?
what is this?
i do not really know what to say.
um, I am not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
get up here, dwight.
yep, not as good as gold.
why are you playing the national anthem?
oh.
what the hell is that?
oh, okay.
I will tell you.
let us see here.
three bedroom, two bath... ...contemporary townhouse.
two car parking... ...wall-to-wall carpets... ...all fixtures included.
yes, this is... this is looking good.
i think it does.
yes.
i think it has a... yeah, it has a deck.
they call it a porch, but it has a deck.
are we ready?
are we going to do it?
ah, the volunteer sheriff station.
no.
oh, anything bad?
mmm-hmm.
mmm-hmm.
no.
i do not need a gun.
hello!
how are you?
I am, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and i guess we are going to be neighbors.
very cool, very cool.
so, uh, so what is the vibe?
what is the vibe of this place?
oh... that is going to change.
because i loves to party and I am going to be partying my butt out at this place.
here is a question for you.
i have a convertible.
is it safe that park that in my driveway.
all right.
see you soon.
good guy.
um, cool.
oh, carol.
hello, how are you?
good to see you.
what?
what are you doing in there?
oh, my god.
dwight.
you know what i might do, i might make this into a kids' room.
i will have a girlfriend once she sees this place.
I am going to get married and I am going to have kids.
I am not going to date a 55-year-old woman.
no, it is not.
just shut up.
you are an ass.
shut it.
no, you do not.
this smells of fraud to me.
this whole thing just kind of stinks.
howard, slash ryan, ryan howard is sitting in my office.
and he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he is kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit.
had a few laughs along the way.
and now he wants to know what i think.
shall we?
let us proceed.
first up, proficiency in necessary skills.
aaaaeeexcellent!
five years from now, what do you want to do?
where do you want to be?
oh!
good.
ambitious.
excellent.
want to be a manager?
that is ridiculous.
ryan's about to attend the michael scott school of business.
I am like mr. miyagi and yoda rolled into one.
much advice you seek.
do you know who that is?
mmm... no.
that was yoda.
there are ten rules of business that you need to learn.
number one: you need to play to win.
but... you also have to win to play.
and i will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
hey!
yes, i was the first one out.
and, yes, I have heard women and children first.
but, we do not employ children.
we are not a sweat shop.
thankfully.
and, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law.
so, i let them out first, i have a lawsuit on my hands.
another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
adapt.
react.
re-adapt.
act.
all right?
that is rule number two.
so what was rule two?
okay, well, let us... .
let us kind of take it a little slower.
okay, uh, well, one is taken.
well, he needs a permanent number, right?
um, yeah.
okay.
that... no, no, no.
i got one.
i got one.
the three stooges.
rule number four.
in business, image is everything - andre agassi.
this car is an investment.
right?
if i have to take out a client or I am seen around scranton in it.
i love it.
i love this car.
do you like it?
wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
hello, mr. egghead!
woop!
so... oh, stanley kaplan!
i know him.
'm' is for murder, 'p' is for... ...for phone.
what?
um, oh, thinking about business school?
really?
so you think you know a lot about business?
uh huh.
yeah.
quiz me.
come on, egghead.
let us do it.
quiz me up.
uh... when i was ryan's age, i worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school.
and then i spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme.
but i learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or ryan would ever teach me.
shut, it.
can i... can i just do it please?
uh, it is equal.
okay.
yes!
it was a trick question.
okay, dwight.
you know what, dwight?
you do not need to help me here.
okay?
well, you know... maybe you should go to business school like ryan, then... then you would know what you are talking about.
for instance, why do not you go to business... stop.
dwight.
you know what?
you are acting like a dork.
would you cool it?
please.
okay.
hey!
he is not your five year old brother, dwight.
he is a valued member of this company... and you know what?
he knows more about business than you ever will.
i did not go to business school.
you know who else did not go to business school?
lebron james, tracy mcgrady, kobe bryant.
they went right from high school to the nba.
so... so it is not the same thing.
at all.
look at this stuff.
market fragments.
what is that supposed to be?
you are so smart.
you are so eff-in' smart.
you should be teaching me.
i became a salesman... because of people, i love making friends.
but then i was promoted to manager, at a very young age.
i still try to be a friend first, but... you know?
I am very successful... your coworkers look at you differently.
huu, what do you think?
nah, I am okay.
oh, hey.
game, what game are we playing here?
oh, i play this at home all the time while I am falling asleep.
what, uh... .
where are we?
where are we here?
mmm.. roy?
roy?
who would you do, roy?
aaaall right.
who is next, who is next, who is next, who is?
jim?
you are next.
who would you do?
well, i would definitely have sex with ryan.
because he is going to own his own business.
who is, uh... who is next?
who we got?
whooo... wish i had my cell phone, but i left it inside.
so... what is that?
yeah.
dwight.
hey!
dwight, do not!
he is an idiot.
the man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
i did not say it to him.
i said it about him.
how long does it take to find a cell phone?
i do not know either.
seriously, where the hell is dwight?
hey, call my cell phone.
it will make it easier for him to find.
i gave it to you in the car.
i saw you program it in.
okay.
alright.
uh, i better tell somebody.
excuse me, sir... dwight!?
great going.
god, man!
why did you go in there?
what... everybody was scared out of their wits, man?
oooh.
wow.
okay.
well, i guess they do not teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
hey, did you miss that day there, ryan?
toaster oven 101?
hey!
i know what will impress everybody, I will start a fire.
oh, man.
bad idea.
bad idea jeans.
...since the world was turning.
okay.
rule five - safety first,  i.e.
do not burn the building down.
okay?
that should be a no brainer.
oh... look!
ryan is book smart.
and i am street smart.
and book smart.
I will give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
and at the end i will reveal, that they were all just one rule.
mmm-hmm.
no, I am not trying to trick him.
I am trying to be a good mentor.
so... no.
no, come on, dwight, i have to have 10 of these by lunch, i promised ryan.
I am not asking the temp for an extension unless i really need it.
happy halloween, everyone!
oh... that is great!
ohh... ok. i know why she is calling.
it is the end of the month, and i was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.
and somehow I am supposed to put on a costume and smile.
okay.
hey, sherri.
michael scott returning.
well, I am going to wait till the end of the day.
because the book said it is best to wait till the end of the day.
i do not know... yet.
i will have to call her back.
okay... sherri?
if you were getting fired, how would you want to be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
thanks.
I will call her back.
wish i could fire sherri.
okay!
I am sorry.
no?
bye.
i mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff.
it is... these are people's lives you are talking about.
yes.
yes.
yeeesh.
um, pam, i have to let somebody go today.
this is, uh, the hardest thing I have ever had to do.
because it is very scary stuff.
you are worried about the party?
there is a man's life at stake here.
no.
or a woman.
a human life.
if you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
and... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
i know.
i sent away for it in july from a catalog.
oh, man.
okay, i have to fire somebody.
hey.
you guys excited about the party?
it is going to be fun.
oh, boy... look at you!
haha.
showing your colors.
bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
all good.
happy halloween.
what happened to all those spooky decorations that we had?
the cobwebs and such?
well, you know what?
go buy some more.
I will approve the overages.
sound good?
good.
oh, yeah, also about budget stuff.
um, I am  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand.
I am going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
well, that is not what I am saying.
just, you know, find it.
pretend that your jobs depend on it.
mmm-hm-hmm.
interesting take on dorothy.
i love it.
hey, you know what would even be better?
soccer ball and cleats.
"bend it like beckham." yeah.
that would be perfect.
well, i do not really have two heads.
so... who do you think it should be?
no, jim brings in money.
eh.
it is not a popularity contest.
although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
what?
there was someone left off that list?
who?
you are right, i did not even think of him.
yeah, that is actually a really good idea.
yeah... i could.
I am not saying that is what he said.
what?
that is not a very nice thing to say about him.
are you kidding?
i agree.
he would land on his feet.
so.
how did it go with stanley?
how... how did he take it?
ahh, come on.
i do not want to fire stanley.
i never said that.
I am certainly not going to do it myself.
get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me.
yikes.
just, okay, just... oh, god.
fantastic!
what?!
that would have solved all my problems.
oh, you idiot.
if you left, i would not have to fire anybody.
big deal.
oh, it would have worked out so well.
can you get it back?
you can call.
can you call  them?
wohahah!
why are you torturing me?!
god.
can i speak to you a minute?
help.
me.
i want you to role play firing me.
i want you to fire me, and i will take it.
yes.
i want you to be me, and i will be creed.
no, no, no.
that is just the first thing... came... in head.
yes, that is a good idea.
aaaahh!
I am going to kill myself!
I am going to kill myself, and it is your fault!
corporate is really breathing down my neck.
and they are saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
i... this is creed.
I am improvising, so just try to keep up.
and I am very angry, and i want... I am going to kill you.
I am going to kill you for firing me.
get off, get off.
no, no.
ok.. just get off.
just, just... yeah.
uh, hey... creed?
could i talk to you for a second?
you are great.
very ambitious.
and i feel like you want more than this little office has to offer.
and i understand that you would want to just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
i... we are going to have to... you... you want something better.
no, you want to leave.
why... why are you making this so hard?
i think you are right.
no, of course  you can not go.
we have not even started this horrible process of... okay, creed.
i need to let somebody go today.
they told me i need to let somebody go.
and as much as i think you are a great guy, and i like you, you are... you are, goodbye.
hmm?
what old days?
what are you talking about?
it is right here on the desk, yeah.
i can not, i can not... i can not change anything.
this is the way... i do not... okay, just listen.
do not... yeah, i went hunting once.
shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel.
took about an hour.
why do you ask?
i have to fire someone today, okay?
okay, well... i already picked you.
and you know that.
so, unless i just go through with this, you are always going to look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
do not... devon, could i talk to you for a sec?
well, he... well, maybe i did.
huh.
no!
i can not, no.
i can not go back.
i would look like an idiot.
no.
no.
it was all the stuff that i said.
it was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and... i just hope that you and i can remain friends.
devon, wait, please.
look, look.
in addition to severance, and everything, i want to give you this gift certificate to chili's.
from me.
okay?
no hard feelings.
i  love halloween.
you know, it is just, it is just fun.
every year, it is just fun.
last halloween i came as janet jackson's boob.
it was topical.
people got a... a big kick out of it.
the year before that, i came as monica lewinsky, and i wore a stained dress.
the year before that, i also came as monica lewinsky.
and before that, i was of.j.
it was pretty funny.
oh, i wish you were here last year.
he... hey, hey, hey, hey!
how you doing?
wow!
you guys looks great.
you look great!
and you are a princess?
a fairy princess.
you are very... .
you are a lion.
wow, i want to hear your, your... oh!
oh, okay, that is all yours.
that is all yours.
grab it, grab it.
you know what?
you guys are getting all of these.
of course.
you are always working hard.
keep it up.
and there is stanley.
no costume?
well, no, not trying to fit in.
i wish i had your confidence, i really do.
no, no.
what could possibly be wrong?
everything's great.
just keep living your lives.
everything's going to be fine.
you are all such wonderful, innocent people.
what?
what?
fine.
if you are so anxious to see a head roll, it is you.
there.
you brought it on yourself.
too bad.
can not say that I am sorry.
it is a relief.
you asked for a name, i gave you a name.
now you are not doing your job.
why do not you just resign?
just know that if i could have fired you, i would have.
you know what?
that is my foot.
you guys... i will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue.
am i correct?
i do not know.
hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?
oh, shoot.
okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.
all right.
all right, this is it.
by the time i get back to our floor, i will have decided.
wow, that is  a fast elevator.
okay, great.
fine.
well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame.
stanley.
not the guy who was trying to be creative.
leave me alone, okay?
oh, wow.
how long have you worked here?
how many years, creed?
yeah, that is right.
fifteen years and three months.
wow, you were hired before i was.
must be thinking about retirement.
why?
it is just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.
yeah.
just trying to be your friend.
of course, i did.
i always... yes, i do.
are you pulling my leg or... you have no clue why I have asked you in here?
oh, here we go.
this... um, here is the deal.
his name was devon.
the human being man's name was devon.
yes, yes, yes.
yes, it is.
uh, well, i am.
a little.
justifiably.
my halloween is ruined.
do you?
i do not think you do.
devon was one of my best buddies.
and now he hates me.
you are glad?
thanks.
thanks so much.
you think it was good?
think i did a good job?
great.
i feel good.
I am going to give myself a pat on the back.
there.
I am doing it.
right there.
great.
yeah, blah, blah, blah.
you people are revolting.
by far, the least popular people here.
i should have fired you.
who knew devon was so popular and had so many friends.
so well-loved.
i do not want to work, i just want to bang on this mug all day.
uhh, yes, i did, here is the dizzle.
i have a very top secret mission for you.
i want you to update all the emergency contact information.
hello, oh god, busy work.
ahh, get away, cretin.
yes, thank you.
i know where to sign.
last year they were out of order, were not they pam?
chillax, pam.
stop pam-m-s-ing.
that is pretty good.
um, actually, I am sending ryan on a top secret mission.
tell her what it is.
is it a priority?
oh i do not know, um, what if there is a tornado, pam?
people's legs are crushed under rubble.
"please, would you be so kind as to call my wife?
no, i can not because we do not have any emergency contact information because pam said it was not a priority." think.
think with your head, pam.
ok, well.
she walks out.
that is the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
catch-22.
yes.
why do not you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what is your cell?
hey ryan.
this is michael jackson calling from wonderland.
this is tito.
calling from... pick up.
this is mike tyson.
and this is more a ying-yang thing.
the 'michael' all cursive, the 'scott' all caps.
left brain, right brain.
or, duality of man.
yeah, yeah, i do not think that would happen.
because i would kick his ass.
so?
I have beaten up black belts.
they told me.
after.
you see, i used to run with a very tough crowd.
street fighter types.
real, real bad people, I am just lucky i got out.
and after that, nobody ever messed with the 'damn rascals' ever again.
you were a jet?
yes, in theory, i have.
i just need to cross some t's and dot some i's.
alright, I am going to be in my office if anybody needs me.
hoo-hah.
oh, wow, sleeper hold.
that is my rebuttal.
shhh.
hoo.
you are the weakest link.
I am friends with everybody in this office.
we are all best friends - i love everybody here.
but sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that are not dentist appointments.
and that is when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.
just hit me.
you will see.
oh, queer...  eye.
queer eye.
that is a good show.
important show.
go ahead.
do it.
oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because i know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
look, dwight is a wuss.
when we rented 'armageddon'... ... he cried at the end of it.
he did.
oh, bruce willis.
are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
ok, here we go.
alright, come on.
fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
yeah.
thank you.
go away.
i have not signed them, ok?
come in.
um, pam, i hate to break this to you but dwight can not stop you from being mugged.
he is just not tough enough.
oh, i could beat up dwight.
that is ridiculous.
i could murder him.
oh, so that is what they are saying?
ok, alright, where is dwight?
ok. watch out kelly, he might sucker punch you.
no, really?
really?
well, the offer, dwight, was for one punch which i absorbed.
i had no idea that there would be a second punch.
so, catch-22.
look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.
really?
you know what?
you are just lucky that we are at work right now.
no, they must have class.
look... hey, toby.
I have got an idea: why do not you leave right now.
why do not you walk away from the room, 'kay?
fine.
we will go at lunch.
pam, make an announcement.
figure out carpools.
i recognize that.
that is japanese for california roll.
i think it is.
a guy told me about that.
oh.
alotta rules.
alotta rules.
on the street we did not have any rules.
maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
hey!
what the hell was that?
no.
alright, that is the way you want it.
play dirty, huh?
ok, game on, man.
I am comin' atcha man.
ok, purple belt, ok. i got him.
i got his pants.
dwight, you have... no, you have something... god, you look like such an idiot!
go on, i dare you to kick there again.
kick there again, i dare ya.
you can not see.
you can not see.
good boy.
good boy.
great boy.
two points, three points, four points.
i win.
i win.
eight points.
nine points.
open your mouth.
you talkin' to me?
you talkin' to me?
"raging bull." pacino.
oh, i want that footage.
i want it.
i need it.
ah, i have to get back to work.
i have lots of work... oh, oh check this out.
come here.
there he is.
mr. temp.
having lunch by the car.
let us play with him.
this'll be hilarious.
oh, we are playing phone tag.
my emergency contact is todd packer.
todd f. packer.
do you know what the f. stands for?
yeah... uh, come in.
oh, hey karate kid.
the hillary swank version.
hi.
how are ya?
he is such a sore loser.
you heard, obviously, that i mopped the floor with him this afternoon.
you know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and i will call the hospital.
cut out the middle man.
yeah.
yeah, just throw them on the chair.
I will take it from here.
so, What are you up to this weekend?
if you are doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
alright, bye.
dwight?
this close.
dwight, may i speak with you for a minute?
well,  busier.
making the time.
well, you do not even have anyone to go home to, toby.
i know, but I have been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it would might help me out.
what do you say?
let us gangbang this thing and go home.
good?
dwight.
i have been testing you the entire day.
did you know that?
and i am happy to say that you have passed.
so effective immediately i am promoting you from assistant to the regional manager to assistant regional manager.
i know, i know, i know, i would not be offering it if i did not think you could handle it.
no, no, title change only.
no, no.
three month probationary period.
let us not tell anybody about this right now.
absolutely but not really.
yes you do.
and, ditto.
i told dwight that there is honor in losing.
which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what i just did for dwight.
would i rather be feared or loved?
um, easy.
both.
i want people to be afraid of how much they love me.
and i think i proved that today at the dojo.
yeah, i do not think that would happen.
see, i used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types.
real, real bad people.
I am just lucky i got out.
i was a bad ass mo-fo.
stanley knows what I am talking about.
I have never lost a fight.
you know why?
my motto.
never say die.
no, that is not how i meant it.
shut up, dwight.
yes.
oh.
well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect.
stinkyfeetville.
kind of a ying-yang.
oh, stretchin'.
i like to stay tight.
compact.
do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?
god, you look like such an idiot.
did you hear about the fight?
well, it was not much of a fight, actually.
i opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
i went medieval on his heinie.
hey, stanley.
i do not tell you how to do your job, do i?
he... grow a pair, stanley.
right?
there not going to downsize because i miss a lot of deadlines.
that is not how business works, okay?
okay.
yes, under my tutelage.
if you did not badger me with so many questions, pam, i could be done with it by now.
wow, graphs and charts, somebody is really been doing their homework.
looks like usa today.
i changed it.
to chili's.
radisson just gives out this vibe, "oh, I am doing business at the radisson".
it is kind of snooty.
so.
here is the thing.
chili's is the new golf course.
it is where business happens.
small businessman magazine.
it will.
i sent it in.
letter to the editor.
uh huh, uh huh.
power trip.
ok, let us do this thing.
wish us luck.
kiss ass.
ok, probably going to go late tonight.
burning the midnight tequila.
so, i think you could all just take off now.
well... no, no.
that would not be efficient.
actually, they just do not get very much work done when I am not here.
that is not true.
i know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I am not here.
not more.
the same amount of work is done, whether i am here or not.
hey, everybody, listen up.
this is what we are going to do.
you sit tight, until i return.
sound good?
does not matter, it is an order.
follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?
alright, ciao.
adios!
uh, I will drive.
it is just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really do not know scranton, do you?
at all!
you ever been to scranton, jan?
dar de- dar de dar.
jan levinson-gould.
jan is cold.
if she was sitting across from you on a train and she was not moving, you might think she was dead.
we should come up with a signal of some sort.
well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal- well, i... it could be either of us.
yeees.
hello?
christian?
thought that was you.
hi.
michael scott.
this is jan levinson-gould.
no gould?
uh, jan, what happened?
is gould dead?
what uh- wow, you are kidding me!
do you want to talk about?
when did this happen?
ok. alright, after you.
awesome blossom.
i think we should share an awesome blossom, what do you say?
they are awesome.
want to, christian, blossom?
ok, it is done.
actually,  megan, may we have an awesome blossom, please, extra awesome?
now it is done.
i heard a- very very funny joke the other day.
want to hear it?
ok. just one joke.
ok.  well, if it is just going to be one, i will think of a different joke.
umm... let us see... choo choo choo.
pam, it is michael.
i need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
yes.
no.
nope.
told it.
not as good as you think.
pick another one.
oh ho ho, yea!
bingo!
and a lighthouse.
yes.
that is hysterical.
could you start that one from the beginning?
first guy says "well, I am an astronaut, so i drive a saturn".
and the second guy says, "well, i am a pimp, so i drive a cheap escort".
and the third guy says "i gotcha both beat, I am a proctologist, so i drive a brown probe".
yum!
yum yum yum!
that is delicious!
i love it!
bop!
be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
that is why i wanted a signal, between us, so that i would not have to just shout non-sense words.
that is her fault.
did somebody say "baby back ribs"?
hmmm?
hmmmmm?
i want my baby back, baby back, baby back chili's baby back ribs... woo, well, this brings us to january  truth or dare?
tell us about your divorce.
ohh, ohh.
oh, so you are not going to play?
she is not playing.
she is not playing the game.
check please.
no, you were not stupid.
gould was stupid.
right?
you know?
it is true.
uh huh, kenneth road, born and raised.
spent my whole life right here in lackawanna county and i do not intend on movin'.
i know this place.
i know how many hospitals we have, i know how many schools we have.
it is home, you know?
i know the challenges this county's up against.
here is the thing about those discount suppliers.
they do not care.
they come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we are all gone, they jack up the prices.
it is bad.
it, you know what, it really is.
well, corporate's going to go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could jan?
see ya.
we did it!
nailed it.
nailed it!
come here.
what!?
going.
ok.  where we going?
does not matter.
going to the go go.
oh-ok. morning, pam.
hey.
no, nothing happened.
i-i swear, nothing happened.
what, I am, totally being serious.
a gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do i.  no, seriously, guys, I am not, i do not want to go into it at all.
it is off limits.
fine, i took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.
it was great.
i mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.
so.
hello, dwight.
who.
uh, no, no, no gould.
this is none of your affair because she is your boss- and she is a woman.
she is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.
and you know what?
i do not think that i can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.
jan, i defend your honor.
is that all?
i know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with hr.
my question: do i do it as the man?
does she do it as my superior?
i do not know.
that leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship.
it is, uh,  excuse me.
hello?
hi!
just talking about you.
the camera?
no.
uh huh.
how is traffic?
i miss you.
what.
ok.  well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.
no.
would you excuse me?
no, i did not intentionally get you drunk.
um hmm.
no, no.
this is just a fight.
this is just a first fight of many fights we are going to have.
right.
no.
wha-so-i do not understand, you want to see other people.
only other people.
wh-why, ok, i think you are still a little bit drunk  excuse me?
excuse me?!
i think you are, yes, why do not you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.
i did not slip you something!
doctor david friendly's egg yolk diet.
it is, it is kind of unique.
it is just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese.
and, um, what you do, you do not just have the egg yolks, it is not like a rocky thing.
you do like hard boiled eggs and i got one a those melon ballers  and i, it is just like a little ice cream scoop, and i just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.
i do not even, i do not even use a plate anymore.
uh, the first couple weeks i did, but you know what, boom, i keep a melon baller in my desk so if i have a hard boiled egg  i know, i know!
but you know what?
it is perfect.
i know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what?
dr. david friendly, he came up with this thing.
the guy, i think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... i, well, the melon baller was my idea.
not today, kevin.
cannot be around carbs today.
you know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?
uh huh.
conflict!
i have a conflict with that.
uh, i have a pajama party.
at the playboy mansion.
with the bunnies.
i can not get out of it!
ok, alright.
I am hearing you, meeting confirmed.
meeting confirmed.
would you like your confirmation number?
please grab a pen, because i will only be repeating this once.
42897.  ok. pam, could i see you in my office?
pam, you are trustworthy- and a woman- and i want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.
"michael, it is january i guess i missed you.
I will, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.
i hope it is understood that that will be our only topic of discussion.
see you soon."  first impressions?
my boss is coming in today, the lovely jan levinson-gould will, well, no gould.
the gould has been  swack, divorced.
um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we will be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.
we just sort of got caught up in the moment.
the vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.
just, uh, she did not want it to continue for some reason.
it, we both, i did not want it, we both did not want it to continue.
was not professional.
um, when people say something is mutual, it never is.
but this was mutual.
"i guess i missed you." i guess i missed you.
so, she misses me?
but then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion".
that does not mean anything, those are just words.
ok. yeah, what, what?
ohhh, great.
well, now I am in a terrible mood.
let us do your performance review- ah, why, that is great news?
that, that, then why would, why would i not like that?
oh, wow, wow.
alright, let us listen to that again.
"michael, it is january  i guess i missed you".
really?
god, stanley, that is frickin' brilliant.
how do you know that?
did you learn that on the streets?
sorry.
no kidding.
good work, stanley.
great performance review.
stanley in the house, everybody.
woo!
angela, your turn.
yeah?
oh; angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
interesting.
jan is calling me.
maybe it was not so mutual after all.
yeah?
jan!
to what do i owe this pleasure?
well, hello to you, too.
um, yeah, i was just um, i just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the chili's.
well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of chili's.
oh.
been thinking about you.
um, i do not see how that is unprofessional.
just- yep.
no.
they are not.
yes, they are.
that is my girlfriend.
pam, i have ideas on a daily basis.
i know i do.
i have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.
um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?
in a folder?
a "michael-idea" folder?
that is unfortunate.
how 'bout the suggestion box?
there is tons of ideas in there.
the suggestion box that i put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?
maybe there is prizes?
why do not you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I will tell them.
hello, everybody?
yeah, uh, attention, please.
jan levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we are going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
what did i say?
well, kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my english and start making some suggestions.
'k?
hi, january  how are you?
good to see you.
ok.  ok, why do not we just step into my office?
we are going to go in here.
yep, right after you.
apres-vous.
no calls.
alright .
it is nice to see you.
really?
oh, well.
alright.
yep.
absolutely.
I am a little confused.
because first it is all like kissy-kissy.
and then it is like all regret.
because "oh, i regret that."  but, "wait, I am still going to call you."  but, but, "we are just going to talk business.
and i may come down and fire you if you do not do your job."  but what were talking about when we first kissed?
business.
no, no, no, i finished all of that.
I am very fast.
I am not too fast.
not like wham-bam-thank ya madam.
but i do say thank ya madam.
but, I am, I am not like wham-bam.
not that there is anything wrong with wham-bam.
if it is consensual.
we are talking about office stuff.
can i ask you a question?
this is a business question.
it is nothing personal, i promise.
are you wearing a new perfume today?
well, you are wearing it at the office.
and  it, I am sorry, but no offense, but it is really sexy.
i do not understand-  hold on.
sorry.
yes, pam.
I am kind of in the middle of something.
i wish you would not interrupt.
i did not, not, not use those words.
no, it is in like ten minutes.
why are we here?
because i value your opinions.
now, i know a lot of do not think that i read your suggestions, but i do.
i just sift through them every week and i really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.
um, so, let us, uh, just read some of these suckers.
alright.
number one: "what should we do to prepare for y2k?" well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.
that happens occasionally.
and, um, one down.
next suggestion: "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression".
ok, alright, enough with the jokes.
nobody in here is suffering from depression.
oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
tom.
then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named tom.
oh, that guy?
that guy was weird.
alright, next suggestion.
arrr, dooby dooby do.
"you need to do something about your b.of." ok, i do not know who this suggestion is meant for, but it is more of a personal suggestion and it is not an office suggestion.
far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
well, toby, if by me you are inferring that i have b.of., then i would say that is a very poor choice of words.
was i, creed?!
ok, well, you know what?
i am implying is that when we are on an elevator together, i should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.
not that i would ever say something like that in public, and i never have, and i never will.
i just think it is something that we should all be aware of.
ok?
now that we have learned this, let us continue.
see, this is good, we are learning and we are figuring some stuff out.
"you need to do something about your coffee breath"- ok. shut up, shut up, shut up, dwight, ok. i do not think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
yeah, is that hard for you?
alright, well- I will work on that- let us keep going.
keep it going.
yep.
what do we have here?
we have somebody is piece of gum.
somebody put a piece of gum in there.
this is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.
this is not a place for gum.
i do not want to have to read these tomorrow.
yeah, what?
uh, alright, next suggestion.
"do not sl-", ok, that is blank  do not, just put it- i do not understand why you are so upset.
let me ask you- ok, let me ask you this.
let me ask you something.
where did you get your outfit?
i just do not understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
look- oh my god... what do you want dwight?
ok, great.
your performance has been adequate.
you may leave; goodbye.
you want to talk now, good; ok, dwight, leave.
why on earth would we give you a raise?
you do?
how do you get in?
that is a serious offense.
very serious.
as is toying with a man's heart.
ok, third wheel, why do not you do that?
that was deer!?
gross, oh!
oh, did not!
what do you say, jan?
ok. you just, uh, clear your head.
that is from superman?
wait.
wait, wait, wait, come, i just, i just want to know why?
ok, so you are saying that there is a different time or place?
well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there is still a chance?
i just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
am i too short?
really?
i appreciate that, thank you.
no, i was not, i did not cry- so my looks have nothing to do with it?
jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.
and it does not matter how great a guy i am.
and that is all i needed; I am good.
i can go home now.
hey, it is 12:20; where the hell's dwight?
never missed a day, my ass.
so... um, you are in accounting... so, good, good, good.
something to work toward, being here more.
I am a big believer in people being here more.
all right.
yup.
absolutely.
"i am not going to discuss anything outside of dunder mifflin business, period." okay.
now, why would jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period?
god, i do not understand women.
how about a clear signal, right?
is that too much to ask?
yes, it is.
yes, i did.
hell, yeah.
yeah.
what?
kind of, yeah.
over the shirt, my elbow, but... um, yup, wait, yes.
no, there... later there was.
yes.
i did not, you know, it was... it was dark, for one thing.
it is next.
just keep it.
"look on the supply shelf." what?
what is that?
all right, ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you?
okay, yeah.
okay.
okay, field trip's over.
come on.
could we please get back to this?
all right, do not break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, stanley?
christ almighty.
all right, next suggestion.
"do not..." okay, that is blank.
do not.
just... well... crystal.
how pleasant.
you can... okay, i think we are good.
hello, is this r. gould?
hi there.
my name is michael scott, i work at dunder mifflin.
i believe i work with your wife, ex-wife, january yeah, that is right, yes.
um... i was wondering if i could ask a personal question about her.
mmm-hmm.
okay, well, could i ask anyway?
uh-huh.
well, I am just going to ask.
when you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?
yeah, that gould is a real interesting guy, a gem.
i can see why he and jan are no longer together.
if my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt.
he was... he had an inability to communicate, shall i say?
he was emotionally unavailable.
i do not know how she dealt with that as long as she did.
well, then, gould was not kidding.
nothing, i just... nothing.
no, i did not.
maybe i did.
maybe i  called him, i do not know.
i... i did not do that.
i... maybe he called me.
ex-husband, you have to let it go.
what is an office?
is it a group of people?
maybe.
is it an idea?
of course, yes.
is it a living organism?
exactly, yes.
and any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that is me.
but the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is january but the brain needs a heart, and that is me again.
so ironic.
you know what?
the heart is smarter than the brain.
but the brain is so effing hot.
it is friday morning and it is another beautiful day in scranton, pennsylvania.
oh my god.
ohhh.
pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
oh, we have a serious problem here.
alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights.
pretend you are not here.
there is no time to think about if this is real.
just, shh, everybody.
the it tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
yeah, i tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected... oh... oh, umm... yes.
ah!
guh-oood.
please do not do that.
i can not tell you.
i do not have to tell you anything.
dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?
I am in the best shape of my life.
look at this.
brrr!
that is strong!
I am not going get a brain- stop it.
uh, oh, ok; if i step on a mine in scranton, pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?
why do not you just go... away?
there are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.
his salary, that would depress them.
his bed, it--  and i am not going to tell them that I will be reading their e-mails.
so how do you search?
try "profits".
no!
try "michael scott".
"michael" "boss" and "funny".
types; result pops up] oh my god, wow!
e-mail from stanley.
stanley,  terribly nice guy.
"sorry i did not write back sooner; i can not go to the game tonight because my boss michael is an ass and making me stay late."  well, stanley's an ass.
not one of our harder workers.
oh, no, everybody; oscar's gone crazy!
what other ghost stories do you have for us?
that I am a robot?
i will destroy everything in my path- beep!
bop!
bommmm.
bop!
onk onk.
oil can.
oil can.
oh, what?
no.
that defeats the whole purpose.
you know what the problem is?
the problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it is scary or bad, but i do not.
i think, wow, i love my big brother.
meredith has an e-vite from jim.
barbeque at jim's tonight.
tonight?
wonder where my e-vitation is.
click on guest list.
angela, stanley, oscar, meredith, phyllis, kevin, creed.
must be... .
no.
there is always a distance between a boss and the employees.
it is just nature's rule.
it is intimidation mostly, it is the awareness that they are not me.
i do think that i am very approachable, as one of the guys.
but maybe i need to be even approachabler.
of course.
hangin' with my crew, crew that i am one of.
hangin' with my cup of noodles.
this is a meal in a cup.
hot, tasty.
reminds me of college.
lived on this stuff.
brain food.
mmmm... you know what i really, really miss about college?
the parties.
everybody'd go.
the athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
yeah!
they were the most fun.
we always invited them.
hey there.
almost quittin' time.
one more hour.
take care of anything you forgot to do.
hey, you know, i do not know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya do not, we could hang out.
you have plans.
i do, too.
i do, too.
i do, yeah.
big plans.
tonight, i can not do it tonight, no.
improv class, i have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds- yeah.
it is the best.
it is the best.
i would not miss it for the world.
but if something else came up, i would definitely not go.
it is.
ok. what?
hey, pam.
do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
alright.
oscar, got big plans tonight with- kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?
where are you off to?
ok, alright.
hey, angela, rushy, rushy.
where you rushin' off to?
yeah, well duh.
where ya headed?
liar!
you are a liar.
dwight, oh ho, dwight, dwight, my loyal compadre.
you and i are hangin' tonight.
the two of us.
we are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.
you know what?
why do not we watch that show that you have been wanting to watch, that stupid battleship galaxy.
that is, whatever stupid show you want- to watch tonight we are watching it.
i did not know you played soccer, dwight.
you, too, dwight?
ooo ooo ooo ooo, mr. cart-air, mr. cart-air.
boom!
detective michael scarn.
I am with the fbi.
think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on tv, or in movies, or in real life?
somebody has a gun.
that is why i always start with a gun, because you can not top it, you just can not.
boom!
freeze!
michael scoon, fbi.
you know what you did.
boom!
boom!
boom!
yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, did not you?
did not ya!?
well, you did not, because i know where ya hid the diamonds.
i been on to you and your little friends for weeks.
boom!
boom!
boom!
boom!
boom!
boom!
boom!
why well, if you had not stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
boring.
i could of- ok. yehhhehh.
I am in.
no, no, no.
I am looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
what are you... nothing.
good, it is good.
good work, everybody.
so bernie's, huh?
we are all going to bernie's?
go to bernie's?
right, right, right.
well guys, I would love to go to bernie's with you, but, you know, i have an office party.
a big office party i need to go to, so...  can not get out of it.
ok, see you later.
nice job, bill.
not.
wow!
who opened the morgue for this thing?
I am just driving by, thought I would drop in.
there is some wine.
i would love a glass, if you are going to open it.
here ya go temp, take my jacket!  ]
oh, come on!
that guy?
he is a good guy, not a terrorist.
karaoke, i love it!
i am a karaoke fiend.
i call dibs.
i got next, i got next up.
come on, let us get this party started, ha!
ok?
where is that wine?
ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, pam?
you want to come up and sing this one?
need somebody else.
takers, please.
baby when i met you there was peace unknown.
kelly?
tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.
i was soft inside, there was something going on.
this part goes to the, uh, girl.
you do something to me that i can not explain.
hold me closer and i feel no pain.
in every beat of my heart, we got something going on.
tender love is blind-- we are making love!
talk!
just talk!
shut up!
funny story: the way that i got into improv was, i got into improv.
the story about me getting into improv was that i was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says "hey you are funny, you are the funniest guy I have ever seen, or my name is not dale earnhardt."   and that was an improv.
um, the real way is that i found a flyer.
um... nope, nope.
i actually wear a turban sometimes.
want to see it?
got it right here.
comedy; it is funny.
it is johnny carson, karnak.
it is, um, put it back.
huhhhh, did you have johnny carson in your land?
oh.
you were forbidden.
alright, I am going to, uhh, get a cup of coffee.
do you want some coffee er- or some tea or hummus or something?
should have done this a long time ago.
tons of personal e-mails, huge time wasters.
uh, uh huh.
wow, like kevin, rating the best bars in scranton?
poor richard's number seven?
idiot.
stupid load.
yeah.
yeah, I am busy right now.
here is a helpful suggestion for jim.
jim, instead of e-mailing amazon, to try and get that cd that you did not receive, i suggest that you go to visa and tell them to cancel the charge.
it is seems like ya did though- jim.
lots of e-mails to amazon, lots of wasted computer space.
alright, let us get back to work.
ooo, bleh bleh bleh.
i do not know.
just felt like taking it off.
man, work can be just so damn frustrating do not ya think, jim?
i do not know, same old stuff.
same old.
boss just been ridin' my ass.
i do not want to talk about it.
i just want to hang out, just be one of the guys.
that is not the point.
yeah.
ok. ok yes, i would never do that.
ha.
no, this is completely the time, this is perfect time.
this is just guys gently ribbing each other, it is what it is all about, just hangin' out.
enjoying friends, all being the same.
worker bees.
no, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around.
I am not a master bee.
I am just a bee, dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'.
five of the clock.
time to go get my improv on.
little bit of the comedy juice.
mmm.
alright, see if you can guess what this is.
that is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class.
just a taste of the improv.
i need to know... who shot johnson!
shut up!
i have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.
just shut up!
i do not want to hear anything more from you.
pow!
pow!
pow!
pow!
no deal.
not with michael scarn, fbi.
michael scarn does not make deals.
michael scarn shoots and then asks questions later.
she was kind of tripping me up, because she was, um, i was trying to get something going, when i was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.
well, you kept- going into nuclear something; that is not where the scene was going.
well, it goes, it goes in the best direction, and that was not the best direction.
well, he, michael scarn, that character, orders people around, and that is, you should of just gone- well... i do not think there is any stronger choice than being a really strong character.
well, it is, like, well, it is, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that is... exactly, thank you.
i appreciate that.
or ryan stiles, something like that.
you should not have been, because you were dealing with michael scarn.
that was exactly what i was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that is a compliment.
good work.
I will just throw out some suggestions.
they are in a whorehouse.
and he is a proctologist.
what?
first sentence is: "I am a proctologist".
alright, I am ready here.
here we are.
oh god.
no, no, turn it around.
you will break it.
you shove it.
shove it back!
here we go.
do not break the branches, dwight.
all right.
well, suck it up.
we all have problems.
hey, everybody, look what we have!
nice, huh?
on three.
ready?
big, one, two, three.
merry christmas!
did it work?
a, that is what she said, and b, i wanted it to be impressive.
the biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, kevin.
and we are going to sell that to charity.
that is what christmas is all about.
merry christmas!
ho, ho, ho,  pimp.
I am kidding.
what do we got, what do we got?
how many plates are we getting?
double it.
double everything.
double ice cream.
double napkins.
double it.
on me.
it was a tough year.
i had to fire somebody this year.
this party has to really rock.
check it out.
christmas bonus.
3,000 g's.
i got this for helping save the company money.
so i guess some good came out of firing devon after all.
maybe i should call him and tell him that.
i want people to cut loose.
i want people making out in closets.
i want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads.
i want it to be a playboy mansion party.
and also, i want you to spread the word that i will have my digital camera.
and I will be taking pictures all along the way.
and the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter.
incentive.
yeah, i know.
damn it.
stupid corporate wet blankets.
like booze ever killed anybody.
no!
no way!
it... no.
you want to be santa?
have you ever seen santa?
okay.
well, I am sorry.
it just does not work.
that makes sense because he has elfish features.
you get something good this year?
yeah?
who did you have?
i think i got something pretty nice for my guy.
i spent a lot of dough.
lot of dough.
wow.
yeah.
i wanted this party to be really special so i sorta went above and beyond.
it was ryan.
yeah.
i have ryan.
all right, let us count it down, like rockefeller center.
ready?
not great.
no, no.
shake it off, everybody.
just, let us do secret santa.
presents are the best way to show someone how much you care.
it is like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "hey, man, i love you this many dollars worth." no, do not!
whoa.
wow.
jeez.
somebody really got carried away with the spirit of christmas.
that was me, i got a little carried away.
you do not know that.
i did?
what?
oh, shoot.
wow.
okay, well, who cares?
it does not matter what i spent.
what matters is that christmas is fun, right?
oh hey, for me.
what is in here?
oh, come on.
an oven mitt?
okay.
so phyllis is basically saying, "hey michael, i know you did a lot to help the office this year but i only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth." i gave ryan an ipod.
i got it!
we are going to turn secret santa into yankee swap.
one person chooses a gift.
the next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift.
if your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
well, i call it fun!
because it is better.
because it is more special.
shut it.
no, it is not.
okay, just give it a shot.
okay, meredith is up first.
here is the deal.
you can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they have already gotten, like the oven mitt.
yankee swap!
that is what makes it fun.
pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
i think this is going great.
everyone wants the ipod.
it is a huge hit.
it is almost a christmas miracle.
oh, well, oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.
i hope nobody takes this baby, because this is great.
wow, look at that fine craftsmanship.
somebody really put a lot of work into that.
it is beautiful.
sucker!
see, i wanted somebody to take it.
boom!
reverse psychology.
reverse psychology is an awesome tool.
i do not know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid.
works like a charm.
"in addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schrute." who wants to take paintball lessons?
how is that better than an ipod?
last gift.
kevin.
what is she so upset about?
come on!
i think that yankee swap was a big hit!
i think it is a success and I am the one who ended up with dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
well, i did not.
i got a big bonus because i fired devon, and i used the money to buy something awesome.
sue me!
it was not.
it was not that much.
it was $3,000.
unbelievable.
i do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out.
well, happy birthday, jesus.
sorry your party's so lame.
all right, now, you are the expert.
is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
cool, cool.
box it up.
uh-oh.
looks like santa was a little naughty.
this is christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
zip it, toby!
just .. i mean, it is a party.
come on.
if i can not throw a good party for my employees, then i am a terrible boss.
who wants a drink?
go, here we go!
anybody making out in here?
not yet, give it time.
oh, hey, ebenezer, boink.
okay, how is it going in here?
no, no, no, no.
we will find some, do not leave the party.
kudos to ryan, king of the party committee.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
oh, no, no.
no false modesty, my friend.
not bad.
and if it could not go to ryan, you are the guy I would want it to go to.
you are welcome.
no way.
oh, you are kidding me.
packer!
yes!
todd packer, ladies and gentlemen!
oh, no, no.
oh look at that.
icing on the cake.
oh, let us fix you up.
who wants to fix up .. toby.
toby's going to fix you up.
darryl.
there you go.
you earned it.
no, no, no, no.
i really, really want you to have it.
hey, merry christmas.
lampshade on head!
it is happening!
yeah, that sounds good.
christmas is awesome.
first of all, you get to spend time with people you love.
secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything.
third, you give presents.
what is better than giving presents?
and fourth, getting presents.
so, four things.
not bad for one day.
it is really the greatest day of all time.
hey, meredith.
heading over to poor richard's?
cool, cool, cool.
do you need a ride?
all right, let us head out.
sounds good.
do you have a coat?
okay!
phyllis and angela and meredith are helpers.
i guess angela's kind of... angela's little.
phyllis and meredith are not little.
pam is sort of a medium helper.
dwight is... dwight looks like spock to me.
he always wears the ears, and i always give him grief about looking like spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be spock, for some reason.
well, thank god you did not steal my oven mitt.
and oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.
yeah.
like anybody would want an oven mitt.
see, that is what christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, "man, i wish i got that." i mean, that is just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else.
i do not know, it is just... i do not know, just makes you kind of feel good.
hello, everyone.
ah!
ha ha ha!
yeah?
stanley!
bo banley.
banana fana fo fanley.
be my mo manley.
stanley.
maybe.
the suspense is just so exciting, is not it?
maybe, i do not know.
well, no.
but... okay, do not spoil it for everybody, all right?
but we are going on a booze cruise on lake wallenpaupack.
it is cheaper.
this is not just another party.
this is a leadership training exercise.
right?
I am going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
it is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat.
we are going on a harbor cruise of lake wallenpaupack.
it is a booze cruise!
no.
this is mandatory.
but do not worry, you know what?
you are going to learn plenty.
this is going to turn your life around, ryan.
well, this... yeah?
to throw you off the scent.
well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
well, that is not my fault, okay?
just.. we are not going to pay for a bathing suit.
okay, i know what you are all thinking, "who is this smart little cookie?" her name is brenda... something, and she is from corporate.
and she is here, like you, to learn from what i have to say.
i am a great motivational speaker.
i attended a tony robbins event by the airport last year, and... it was not the actual course.
you have to pay for the actual course.
but it talked about the actual course.
and I have incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
leader... ship.
the word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation.
so if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, i am the captain.
but we are all in the same boat.
teamwork!
now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department?
anyone?
yes, darryl, the sales department makes sales.
good.
let me just explain.
i see the sales department as the furnace.
all right, let us not get hung up on the furnace.
this just... it is the sales... i see the sales department down there.
they are in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right?
i mean, who saw the movie titanic?
they were very important in the movie titanic.
who saw it?
show of hands!
titanic?
no, I am leo dicaprio!
come on!
no!
thank you, spoiler alert.
you saw the movie, those of you who did.
they are happy down there in the furnace room.
and they are dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they are singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
the... no, no.
no, i did not... okay.
well, okay, in a nutshell, what I am saying is... leadership.
we will talk more about that on the boat.
ship.
a three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
pam, you are mary ann!
we have the professor and ginger, welcome aboard.
angela, you are mrs. howell.
lovey.
uh... the native.
sometimes they come from neighboring...  we have one of the globetrotters, i am the skipper, and dwight, you will be gilligan.
I would rather die.
hi, i am michael scott, i am the captain of this party.
okay.
in an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain.
on a boat, who knows?
it is nebulose.
hey, look!
I am king of the world!
and i am the regional manager of dunder-mifflin, michael scott.
welcome, welcome!
okay!
so... right.
but do not worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.
I am your party captain too!
and you are going to put on your dancing shoes later on!
so we are going to... rock it!
if the boat's a-rockin', do not come knockin'!
yep.
we are all going to have a good time tonight!
hm?
okay.
yep.
having fun?
good.
well, that is what scranton is all about.
not like you new yawkers.
well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the gilligan thing, so... right now, i was thinking.
yes.
okay, listen up all you dunder-mifflinites!
i would like to talk to you all about life preservers.
now, one important life preserver in business is it support.
so, okay.
but before that, i have to do my presentation.
all right, we will have a motivational dance contest!
hit it!
yeah, okay, dancing!
it is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that is always trying to teach people things.
sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
ah!
see, this is of general interest.
it is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy.
what is important to you?
if the boat is sinking, what do you save?
no, no.
salesmen and profit centers.
okay, well, obviously you do not know anything about leadership.
okay.
not what i was looking for, but a good thought.
i do not want to take credit for this, but roy and i were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices.
right?
did i motivate you?
well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.
congratulations.
that is great!
yes!
i can marry you as regional manager of dunder-mifflin!
then I will give you away!
captain jack is a fart face.
I am on medication.
vomicillin.
okay.
all right.
it is time to be boss.
it is time to motivate.
let us blow some minds here.
okay, guys, guys, cool it.
everybody, dunder-mifflin scranton employees, brenda, i have some very, very urgent news i need to tell everybody right now.
listen up.
the ship is sinking!
okay?
we are going down, right now.
just wrap your heads around the reality of that.
shh, please!
everybody, it is my turn now, okay?
captain jack is gone.
in five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake!
and there are not enough spaces on the lifeboat!
who are we going to save?
do we save sales?
do we save customer service?
do we save accounting?
this is a business scenario.
right?
it is a scary... it is a... it is a predicament, and it is something that each and every one of us has to think about.
I am in the brig.
see?
the boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised.
what was the deal with the guy jumping overboard?
what was... if he had just waited and heard what i had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
is somebody there?
captain jack has a problem with authority.
he just totally lost it.
if you ask me, he caused the panic.
well, it is nice for you.
your friend got engaged.
roy said the first one did not count.
really?
you are kidding me.
you and pam?
wow.
i would have never have put you two together.
you really hid it well.
god!
i usually have a radar for stuff like that.
you know, i made out with january.. yeah?
yep.
well, pam is cute.
well, if you like her so much, do not give up.
bfd.
engaged are not married.
never, ever, ever give up.
it is a fake wheel, dummy.
hello.
of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
have a seat.
oh, every man's dream.
two ladies at once.
what?
why are you looking at me like that?
okay, you heard something.
um, yeah, it is a booze cruise, but it... there is more to the story than that.
it... leadership off-site.
uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme... yeah, i do not even know why i said booze cruise.
i do not even think there is booze on the boat.
of course.
of course, of course.
yes.
yes.
look, i have a whole program planned.
jan, this program is going to change people's lives.
i am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.
hello.
oh, cool.
cool.
and maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night.
awkward.
that is... you know what.
brenda, could jan and i have a moment alone?
really?
you seriously said that?
okay.
brenda, could jan and i have a moment alone?
thanks.
oh, okay.
I will see you later.
I will call you later.
that is like... I will call you, too.
so.
you are probably going to get carded, so i can make you a fake id.
we have a laminating machine.
I am not giving you the answer.
deck hands is one.
and... no, I am first mate.
you are second mate.
I am first mate, as the captain.
well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down.
toby is the anchor.
oh, god.
he, well...  tell you about toby later, he is awful.
oh, hey, toby.
so... it is an analogy.
idiot.
no, no, no.
that is his punishment for not being here on time.
too bad, anchor!
your problem now, captain jack.
flash cards.
you are going to get seasick if you keep reading in here.
that is a great way to kill this party.
not on my watch.
let us, uh,... let us rock.
let us rock some stuff here, okay?
okay... I am hearing a little too much reverb.
can we down the reverb?
all right.
follow my lead.
does you guys know that?
take the bass.
take the drums.
what?
you know what?
i do not think it is in... that is not in tune.
i do not know if you can... ...make much of out of it, creed.
good luck to you.
i do not know.
it is a defective ax, my friend.
good luck.
those slide moves are just bush league.
i hope i die before I am old.
yeah!
toast!
that is my line!
that is my line, that is... i always say that at weddings.
so I will just think of something else to say.
i... thanks.
pam!
it is michael.
help me!
i need help right now.
I am hurt, i have hurt myself.
oh my god!
ungh, this is not looking good pam!
no, i want you to pick me up.
i am hurt.
i hurt my foot.
i want to come to work.
but i need you to come and pick me up.
oh god!
oh god!
ok, buhhhh, i burned my foot very badly on my foreman grill and i now need someone to come and bring me into work.
i enjoy having breakfast in bed.
i like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.
and since i do not have a butler, i have to do it myself.
so, most nights before i go to bed, i will lay six strips of bacon out on my george foreman grill.
then i go to sleep.
when i wake up, i plug in the grill, i go back to sleep again.
then i wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.
it is delicious, it is good for me.
it is the perfect way to start the day.
today i got up, i stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that is it.
i do not see what is so hard to believe about that.
pam, could you come get me?!
ok, could someone come and get me please, ryan?
there is no toilet paper here.
could ryan... tell ryan to bring toilet paper.
could you tell  them that?
i tried hopping, kevin, and i bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
no one wants to pick me up!?
I am not sick!
I am burned!
do not... is that dwight?
i do not want dwight.
i do not want dwight!
i do not have a girlfriend.
it was all made up.
just someone come, ok?
anyone.
anyone but dwight.
hellooo?
... please do not send dwight!
morning everyone.
do not freak out.
i forbid anybody to freak out.
clearly, i have had a very serious accident, but i will recover, god willing.
i just want to be treated normally today.
normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I have been through.
did you explain why?
burned my foot, pam.
please stop popping my cast.
thank you.
ha ha ha.
so where are you shipping... thank you.
pam, messages please?
really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and... no, your job is being my friend, pam.
ow!
god!
what?
i do not want any special treatment, pam.
i just want you to treat me like you would some family member who is undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.
i do not think that is too much to ask.
no, i do not want some aspirin, yeah I am a little fussy.
aspirin's not going to do a damn thing.
I am sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.

yes, you did.

phyllis, oscar, ryan, who is supposed to be dead, can i ask you all a question?
do you all know what it is like to be disabled?
oscar?
no, never heard of it.
no, a <i>real</i> disability, not a woman's trouble.
wuh, how, how old are you?
look, the point is, i am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I am sure stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
ok,  what does this look like to you stanley?!
shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.
you people are jerks.
imagine if you had left stevie wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
i burned my foot!!!
ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!
while we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, i wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
good question.
forrest gump: mentally challenged, philadelphia : aids.
i do not think so, no.
he grew into a man overnight.
rare disability, still works.
a crossword puzzle stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
what you mean uh hmmm... ?
ok. yes, right in here, come on in.
this, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
you are so brave.
you are so brave.
but it is hard for you!
right?
because you are in a wheelchair.
let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
oh my god, that is three times as long as it takes me.
how did you get in your wheelchair?
hey, hey, hey, not funny!
not funny.
well, that is good, he still has a sense of humor.
well they notice it.
do not you?
you notice it.
it is the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, is not it?
ok... ignore him.
you know what?
we are not that different, you and i.  when i clamped my foot into a non-stick... yeah... ok. did you see born on the fourth of july?
i was under the impression that billy would be more like that guy.
hey!
you did it!
look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.
very nice.
thank you, ryan.
did you get the yams?
ok, I will just have the pudding.
yeh.
you know what?
i feel better.
ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
yeah, baby, i am feelin' better.
my body's literally healing itself.
it is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
why do not you go with him?
i can not take you, i do not have my car and yours is all vomity.
oh, ok, that is, great.
no, i can not drive.
jim why do not you drive.
we will go.
I am still recovering.
so let us just, ryan, could you get my coat please.
shotgun!
the rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.
the first person to shout "shotgun" when you are within the sight of the car gets the front seat.
that is how  the game's played.
there are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
oh, god, a mini-van.
what is meredith's problem?
well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.
she is not going to find one driving this thing around.
chuck e. cheese?
oh, god, I am so sick of chuck e. cheese.

no... you know what jim, this is not about me anymore.
i made a miraculous recovery, which is more than i can say for him.
hi dwight.
doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
well, you do not have all the information.
the foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
look since you have the machine up and running, can i just stick my foot, we take a look?
ok, what kind of machine is that?
that is my joke, damnit dwight.
it is ok, they are with me.
alright, well, i guess this is where we leave you off.
uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.
we will, see you when you get out.

bureaucracy and germs.
yes, so, no thank you.

today is spring cleaning day here at dunder mifflin.
and yes i know its january.
i am not an idiot.
but, if you do your spring cleaning in january; guess what you do not have to do in the spring?
anything.
they say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.
well i say that an empty desk means a... no, that is not... no, that is not what i was going to say.
yes.
on a friday?
i will do all the talking.
what difference does it make whether your here?
hi, oscar its michael.
yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
really?
oh, that is a shame.
you know it is cleaning day here today?
could have used some of that famous hispanic cleaning ethic.
what are your symptoms?
umm, hmmm.
i need you to go back to bed.
i need you to get better.
see you monday.
unless you are still sick.
so have a great long weekend.
he sounded sick.
that is exactly what i was thinking.
yeah.
drop what you are doing.
make this a priority.
because an office can not function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
wowweee.
mikey likey.
why do not you wear your hair like that all the time.
it is much sexier.
man, this must be torture for you.
hey jim-bag.
really?
who else knows?
wow!
jim and i are great friends.
we hang out a ton, mostly at work.
but, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.
and it is why, i intend on keeping that secret for as long as i possibly can.
my lips are sealed.
my lips are sealed... bangles.
can you hear me, they talk about us... hey, What are you gettin'?
ah, good stuff, good stuff.
did you see the game last night?
any of them?
so, uh, what is the 411?
any news on the "p" situation?
p-a-m. p-a no it is okay, we are talking code.
listen stanley.
how long does it take you to pick out a soda?
alright, well, cool.
still deciding?
peach iced tea.
you are going to hate it.
it is grrrrrrape!
soda.
not so much.
nothing.
fact: i love grape soda.
i always have.
fact: jim and i talk all the time.
we tell each other secrets.
um, i do not know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
ok. good.
whooo, nice.
that was, that was slick.
what are you doing for lunch?
oh nonsense , no way, no.
why do not, why do not i take you out to lunch?
my treat.
hey you know what we could do?
we could spread out a blanket in the break room.
have a little picnic order some 'za.
talk about you know who.
i know just he place.
oh man, you should order milk.
get it?
why do i like hooters?
well i will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
oh, here we go, here we go.
bogy at 3 of the clock.
hi.
we are not worthy.
we are not worthy.
hello dana, i am michael and this is jim and we are brothers.
I am his boss actually.
and i treat him well.
I am taking him out to lunch because i can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
tell me dana, how is your chicken breast?
mmmm, sounds yummy.
i will have a chicken breast hold the chicken.
no, I am going to have the gourmet hot dog.
what do you like best about pam?
is it her boobs, or... really?
never get's any of my jokes.
her boobs, definitely.
oh, thank you.
ohhh happy birthday jim!
woo!
yeah!
thank you very much.
hilarious.
hey.
just go to his house and see if he is sick.
i could have done this investigation in like twenty minutes.
just do it.
expenses.
no.
it is... i wear it like that sometimes.
is that a wig?
yeah, it is a business lunch.
no he did not.
i do not need his permission.
uhhh it is ridiculous.
they took my card away because i spent $80 bucks at a magic shop.
what they do not understand is that i bought the stuff to impress potential clients.
so business related, right?
i put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter.
and you know what toby?
they almost bought from us.
look jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.
how is that not work related?
you are not his friend, you do not know.
he is in love with a girl he works with who is engaged.
so just cut me some slack.
please?
you know what kevin?
jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is jim and pam... and me.
i know, i know, i know.
i, oh, just, um, i know i was trying to, expense reports.
and then god, toby, you know he just... i know.
I am just, i just hope that, i just hope that  this does not affect our friendship!
stupid, this is so stupid.
ok, I am fine, no i know, I am good, I am good, it is just.
yeah I am good.
yeah I am fine.
look, about you and jim.
no, i feel it is my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
it was not that long ago.
it was on the booze cruise.
yehhh, okay, shuuttt it michael.
I am done.
that is it.
I am out.
people are always coming to me.
"michael, i have a secret.
your the only one i trust." no thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble.
like i was watching cinemax last weekend.
this movie, portrait of a... prostitute something.
secrets of a call... more secrets of a call girl.
and the lead character, shila, is framed for murder.
she goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in malibu.
i do not, i do not want to live like that.
i like it here.
i do not want to be shila, i like being michael scott.
oh, pam with the dirty talk.
oh!
no, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that is much harder to do.
no, no, no, no.
i do not want to chip my mug.
please get that off the floor.
all right.
jack nicholson for birdie.
it is a celebrity tournament.
do you see it?
do you feel it?
god... damn it, dwight!
that is great.
that will not be necessary.
no, i am the king bee, no, king is higher.
then ace.
i am the ace bee.
keep.
i will finish that later.
yeah, i know when it is from, ryan.
keep the change.
here you go buddy, happy birthday.
you are welcome.
no, no, no, no.
i have the long sleeve.
and actually, you know what we should do?
we should wear them tomorrow to work, it will be hysterical.
okay, tuesday.
whenever.
you would better try it on, make sure it fits.
spamster!
hamster.
welcome back!
how was your vacation?
yeah?
did you get lucky?
oh!
boink!
i am pam.
spicoli guy.
oh, god.
names, numbers.
okay.
whoa!
god!
yuck, yuck.
yuck.
yuck!
wow!
what happened in there?
there is stink in there, my god!
what is... what is that?
is it a bird?
oh, god!
how could that happen?
how could... right in the middle of the carpet.
um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
check it out.
check it out.
do not be a wuss, just get... no, I am not holding your coffee.
what is it?
what is it?
no, just tell me what it is.
i cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
how do you know that?
what is it, then?
here she comes.
all cleaned?
great.
that is worse.
i am a big fear factor fan.
I am a big fan of anything joe rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.
um...    i can not stand it , i can not stay in here another second.
no!
hey jim.
i thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
oh... it is ... yeah ... no, no, no!
seriously, i do not mind sharing.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
old bullpen.
do not ape me.
this is great.
the pressures of my office are insane.
i just... you could not understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?
i used to sit right here.
yeah.
ed truck.
ed truck was the manager before me.
horrible.
he hated fun.
it was like, "oh, ed truck is walking toward us.
stop having fun.
start pretending to do work."  what a jerk.
he is... you know what?
i swore to myself that if i ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as i walked away.
you know who used to sit at that desk?
mm-mm.
todd packer.
yeah.
he was, but, uh... that desk was empty.
he would come in and sit there sometimes.
when i was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... i worked side-by-side with a fellow named todd packer, and together we rocked the office .
packer and i once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that <i>they</i> were crazy.
i will gladly pay you tuesday for a hamburger today.
oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.
okay.
another time, packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute.
guy had no sense of humor about it.
probably why he was not hired.
charley horse!
charley horse!
oh, okay.
gah.
once, as a joke, packer banged every chick in the office.
it was hysterical.
dwight.
let us send up accounting.
old fashioned raid.
sales on accounting.
yeah.
follow my lead.
hey guys.
ahem.
what is up?
yeah!
oh ho ho no, no, no, no.
we do not do that.
we do not do that.
watch out, pam.
you are next!
maybe!
why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?
i do not know.
it could be done out of hate.
it could be done out of love.
it could be completely neutral.
maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.
and, well, she does not do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.
i hate her.
you know what?
i am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.
the only thing that makes any sense.
stop.
stop it.
stop.
it.
do not.
do not.
all right.
hi, guys.
I am just walking around.
well, yeah.
oh, and I am not?
why would you say that?
because I am having fun?
you guys just are workin' for the weekend, are not you?
I am workin' for the week.
sales team, listen to me.
this is what we are going to do.
I am going to up the ante a little bit literally.
right here, I am going to put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.
the person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.
sound good?
seventy, eighty, one, two three.
eighty-three dollars.
still a lotta money and I am going to ...  ... I am going to leave it right over here where everybody can see it.
i will be taking jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.
let us see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
oh, it is on, phyllis, it is so on!
god, this is going to be fun.
so you have 40 boxes going out, and i will deliver those personally in a sebring.
very good, nice doing business with you.
thank you.
yes!
oh, yeah!
read it and weep.
oh!
oh, look at that!
look at me, phyllis!
oh, what is that?
that is my sale!
nothing.
no.
just ... you know what, guys?
it is none of your concern.
it was official business, so just... yeah, paper business.
is this done?
extreme home makeover puts together a house in an hour.
if you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.
this was no act of god.
a person did this.
a person who works in this office.
maybe all of them.
you know what?
today is not a good day for a sales contest.
we are... we are not... we are not doing this today.
you want to talk about fair?
does anyone need to smell my old carpet?
you explain to me how that was fair, and I will explain to you how this is fair.
plus i just... i think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
i am a victim of a hate crime.
stanley knows what I am talkin' about.
well i hated it!
a lot!
okay, i... you know what?
if the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we would be done .
very well.
then you are all punished.
you are all on a time out.
just sit there quietly.
no.
no!
do you remember ed truck?
how would i know?
my biggest fear is turning into him.
i was not talking literally, creed.
yeah, being buried alive would be worse.
happy?
why am i talking to you?
ed?
hi.
thanks for meeting me.
must be kind of neat comin' back.
uh, well, honestly ed, i really do not want to be up there right now.
oh, no, no, no.
you are good.
it was clerical.
you are good.
um, well, somebody did something in my office, and i now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
i did not get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
really?
well, that figures.
so how did you deal with people not liking you?
well... s-sure i can.
not necessarily.
you can love a boss like you do a father.
well, okay.
different management styles.
last week i would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.
i would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.
but now, no.
i do not have the relationship with these people that i thought i did.
i hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "uh... no.
i only give my organs to my real friends.
go get yourself a monkey kidney." yes.
who is this?
how did you get this number?
oh my god.
packer.
packster.
whacky pack.
how you doing?
uh... no.
did anybody see a package here today?
no.
how big was it?
really?
did you see a big package?
where did you leave it?
really?
guys, did you see a big package in my office?
are you kidding me?
oh!
that was packer!
oh, you are... you are dead.
you are dead, my friend!
that is hilar... oh, god!
of course it was you.
oh.
yeah, yeah!
oh my god.
it was packer!
it takes an advanced sense of humor.
i do not expect everybody to understand.
it was done out of love, just like i thought.
it is ah... god, these people are so... these are good people.
we have fun.
we just have fun!
oh, I am just so sorry that i threw the thing out.
what is going on?
anything here?
yes, yes.
what yes?
a sale or a lead or... ah.
small?
huge?
would you say the sale that i made earlier was huge or... what was that?
you call that a sales call?
my god, what have they been teaching you?
yeah, well, did i teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?
no, i did not.
exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.
do you know a joke?
call a client right now.
and tell him the joke.
strike while the iron's hot.
a joke always works.
just sell it.
give me the phone.
give me the phone.
tell him.
tell him that your supervisor is on the line.
the old one two.
let us do it.
hey howard.
michael scott here.
yeah, sorry about that.
dwight is an idiot.
i know.
no, he is a little... little dim.
he is the janitor's brother, so... uh-huh?
yeah.
well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can not even find their way to work?
that is dwight.
what can we do to help you out?
you know what?
i have a discount.
today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.
uh-huh, yes, i can do that.
absolutely!
perfect.
oh, I am glad it timed out that way.
hey, what is going on?
yeah... i... you know what... i... i... i just thought about it.
i just have a few things i want to say.
hold... just hear me out.
what is more important than quality?
e-quality.
now studies show that today's woman, the ally mcbeal woman, as i call her, is at a crossroads... no, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.
but i just... just want to keep it within reason.
they did this up in albany... and they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so... well, I am their boss, so i feel like... anybody want any coffee or... women in the workplace... yeah, translation "i have been banned from my own conference room so that jan can talk in secret to all the girls." oh!
sorry.
'women of the workplace.' about what?
i do not know.
clothes.
me.
eeegkh!
everyone.
guys.
circle up, please.
come on over.
bring your chairs.
toby, come on over.
you are a guy... too... sort of.
let us do this!
well, first of all, i, uh, just want to warm up a little bit.
let us just clap.
let us just clap.
ready?
yeah!
yeah!
that is what I am talking about!
just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
why can not boys play with dolls?
why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
we have nowhere else january this... ok, ok, fine.
yeah, actually, perfect.
perfect.
you know what?
there is another side to this place, gentleman.
and i know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office.
but do you realize that underneath us, there is another world.
the warehouse world.
a world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life.
life.
the bowels of the office.
these guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work.
we are going to learn how a warehouse works.
oh, i think it is going to work out great.
because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job.
and i have not been there in months.
so let us meet the warehouse!
let us get some shots.
pan around there.
this is darryl, one of our warehouse staff.
darryl, what is your biggest fear?
you know, darryl is actually the foreman here and not roy, which is cool.
there is roy riding the big rig.
so roy is actually going to be marrying pam sometime this summer.
and... uh, she is our receptionist.
sort of a brangelina thing.
brangelina is the brad pitt and angelina... roy... roy and pam.
it is a ram.
it is a ram thing.
uhhuhhuh.
just in case there is someone down here who should not be.
a little "good will hunting" situation.
all right.
troops.
this is an important day.
big day.
now you may look around and see two groups here.
white collar.
blue collar.
but i do not see it that way.
and you know why not?
because i am collar-blind.
oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what?
i do not think... you.. you are... my job sucks compared to this.
i do not think you would like it up there.
guys!
want to start unloading the truck?
check this out!
look at that!
look at that  bwup-bwa!
hello!
how are...  oh!
kay.
that is great.
that is good stuff.
hey, you are going to, going to hurt yourself.
stand clear.
I am fine, I am fine.
I am fine.
oh, oh, oh!
we will get somebody to clean that up.
we ought to have this thing serviced.
so!
guy's gripe session.
here we are.
now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common.
we even like the same girls, some of us.
that is going to happen, you know.
we are guys, so... no, why?
why would i... ?
you could... stay or... let us start with the warehouse.
what bothers you as guys, you know?
ok. ok, yeah.
yeah.
yeah shhh... i... that was just... i was breathing.
i hate shushing.
you know, that is the thing!
what the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
ok. alright.
good.
guys ragging on each other.
that is what guys do... and we love it.
i feel you.
yes.
ah, you do.
so... i know.
god!
what is that?
it blows.
it blows, man.
gah... no.
whoa, whoa.
yeah.
you know what?
is that necessary?
because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
dockworker's?
yeah.
you know what?
i think the problem is the chicks.
the problem is the chicks.
and you got to blame them.
yeah-es.
this is important.
ladies, take a breather.
jan, i uh want to... can i help you?
um... i wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union.
and they have some good points... do not get hysterical.
part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
let us... be... rational... here.
what are the pros?
what are the cons?
do not talk to me that way please.
just... they are going to want to hear this from you.
but we are bonding down there!
i mean i just do not want to have to tell them something they are not going to want to hear.
ok. come on january after all we have been through... we have a history... ...between us.
i will not I am just saying we have something... ok. whatever.
cold front coming into the warehouse.

hi.
yuh, yuh, yes!
i... i have essentially... i have essentially.

I have taken some... I am just going to put this over there.
you did uh... okay.
pizza.
great equalizer.
rich people love pizza.
poor people love pizza.
white people love pizza.
black people love pizza.
do black people like pizza?
hey.
um... look guys, I am sorry.
sometimes jan can be such a bitch.
hey, watch it, watch it.
we have a relationship.
thank you to our hosts.
ahhh!
excellent.
is it good to be back.
yeah.
i mean i love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women.
you know why?
because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
and now, i realize that you can program or download any ring you want.
so, I am a little overwhelmed.
there is a lot of choices.
you got to help me here.
which one of these is coolest?
what do you think?
no, no.
dude, are you kidding me?
no.
that one says, "i am so lame." know which one i want?
there is one that sounds like a jackhammer.
just really grabs your attention.
it is like...  you know what I am talking about?
what are you guys talking about?
cool.
working on it.
yup.
and now, i realize that you can program or download any ring you want.
so, I am a little overwhelmed.
there is a lot of choices.
you got to help me here.
which one of these is coolest?
what do you think?
no, no.
dude, are you kidding me?
no.
that one says, "i am so lame." know which one i want?
there is one that sounds like a jackhammer.
just really grabs your attention.
it is like...  you know what I am talking about?
yes.
what are you guys talking about?
cool.
working on it.
yup.
all right.
alright dwight, as you know i am heading to new york today.
doing a presentation on the branch to the new cfo.
nope.
the opposite of that.
ok, good.
i probably will, why do you ask?
yeah.
<i>what</i> is your problem?
this is a business trip.
i would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to jan about what happened between us.
her words, not mine.
she sent me an email this morning.
but, it is valentine's day.
it is new york.
city of love.
hey, pam.
you heart n.y., right?
you want me to pick you up anything?
alright.
dude, I am going to nail it.
me in new york?
oh, i own that city.
fuggedaboudit!
see ya!
well here we go.
on our way to new york.
new york, new york.
city so nice they named it twice.
manhattan is the other name.
the meeting is not 'til three, but i always like to come to new york little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite new york pizza joint.
and I am going to go get me a new york slice.
here it is, heart of new york city, times square.
named for the good times you have when you are in it.
most people when they come to new york, they go straight to the empire state building, that is pretty touristy.
i come here.
great places to eat.
we have bubba gump shrimp, red lobster down there.
ya know.
this is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
everybody takes the subway in new york.
it is fast, it is efficient, gets you there on time.
it is a way to  okay, there is a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
this is the world famous rockefeller center.
founded, of course by theodore rockefeller.
this is a skating rink and i think the rangers practice there sometimes and it is, that is tina fey .
that is tina fey from saturday night live.
hello?
hello, hi?
oh, I am sorry, i thought you were , ok, i thought that was.
she, she looked a lot like tina fey.
hello, hello, i thought that was tina fey, but it was not.
so... are you serious?
he was here?
when, when i was talking to the fake tina fey?
come on!
and are you, argh.
i would love to live in new york someday.
it is a big dream of mine.
work for corporate, with january it would be awesome.
go to broadway shows, eat hot dogs.
scranton is great, but new york, is like scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.
ok, umm, i think, that is either the hudson or the east, so we are back,  should be back this way.
there is a lotta pressure on me right now.
it is like michael jordan, in the nba finals.
or, like stormin' norman schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it is over, we will not have to deal with those iraqis anymore.
let us do it.
there they are.
what is up?
hey hey.
josh porter, high five.
bam.
yeah, how ya doing?
nobody needs to introduce this guy.
craiggers.
you have been kicked out of every strip club in albany, is that true?
so what is going on?
what i miss?
cool.
good, good, good.
give us some time to catch up, and... ay, kay.
come on, you know, that is not.
cool it.
maybe because she is my girlfriend.
was, or not my girlfriend.
she is... we hooked up and... you know, months ago, just once, it is, just stupid.
just forget it, yeah, yeah.
ditto.
how are you jan?
what is a business?
is it a collection of numbers and sales reports?
sure.
but as you know, david and jan, it is much more.
life moves a little slower in scranton, pennsylvania.
and that is the way we like it.
because at dunder mifflin scranton, we are not just in the paper business, we are in the people business.
let us meet some of the folks that make the scranton branch so special.
this is stanley hudson, one of our talented salesman.
an african-american father of two, stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we are hoping to build our bases on.
yeah, i shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my mac.
i was thinking of entering it into some festivals.
probably will not.
you know, not what this is about.
and finally, pam beesly.
look at her.
look how cute.
not bad at all.
as the receptionist, pam is truly the gateway to our world.
well, i hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at dunder mifflin, scranton.
what it is like to walk a mile in oscar's shoes.
or try on phyllis' pants.
maybe even one of angela's famous brownies.
and you will know, that you are home.
questions?
yes, thank you.
yes, absolutely david.
get that for you.
i umm... oh, ok. alright.
no you are not.
technically, we fell asleep in the same bed.
so... yes.
I am sorry.
i will fix this.
I will talk to him.
I will talk to david.
i am serious.
and do not call me shirley.
airplane.
no no no no no, yes i, ok, well, alright, here is the deal.
it is my fault.
this is, this is totally on me.
before you guys came in, i was talking to the guys.
we were all chatting and i made a joke, a really dumb joke and craig the idiot took it seriously.
i did, it was stupid.
and craig, you saw him, he is not the sharpest tool in the she would.
although he is a tool.
i know.
it was borderline at best and... and jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I am really sorry.
it will never happen again.
oh, no big deal.
really.
sorry again.
yeah, happy valentine's day.
oy vey... schmear.
i love you, angela.
yes, even you.
i love you, kelly.
i love you, meredith.
this is all platonically, of course.
i love ladies, always have.
and you know what i think is the most attractive part of a woman's body?
the brains.
because i do not think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart.
and also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.
great.
thank you.
okay, here is the thing about january she talks such a big game about, "oh there is nothing between us and stop talking about it." and "border-line harassment when you call me at home." but let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on valentine's day?
answer, maybe, but maybe not.
we shall see.
you know what?
it was nice to see devon again.
to sort of get closure on that whole thing.
let us think this through.
if we ask corporate for that then... could go either way.
we do not know what they are going to say.
have to think it through.
because if they say no... no!
yes, we have to!
you know why?
because i do not like to be cooped up in that office!
in that box!
all day long.
heisman!
because i need to think.
okay, jim?
oh, kevin, oh!
nice catch.
mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm.
os-car!
intercepted.
give it to me.
phyllis, give me the ball.
ok, give me the ball.
give me, you guys... creed give me the ball!
right now give it to me.
hey, dwight.
you all right ryan?
pam!
that is what she said!
grapes.
seductive.
so you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
oh!
abso-fruit-ly.
fruit.
grapes.
nailed the joke.
matter of time.
um... and yes, it is a big speech.
biggest of your life.
speaker at the sales convention.
been there, done that.
went there again, did it again.
two years in a row.
consecutive.
i just... i miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it.
sir, you are awesome!
here is a plaque.
what, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof?
here is a certificate.
they stopped making plaques that year.
that would look terrible.
these are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
that is because you are incapable of doing it because you do not know how.
because you have no skills.
dwight, there is no way i can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
but i can teach you enough so that you do not embarrass me or the company.
well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
do not.
do not try and think of a question to humor me.
just... try not to be such an idiot.
insult.
but seriously, what is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
it is a joke, dwight.
it is not a sex ed class.
yeah, you are right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?
the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
i do.
both of them.
no, no!
they would remember them.
look, it does not matter what you say.
it just matters that you are saying something that people care about.
yeah?
all right?
here we go.
watch this.
attention everybody!
attention please!
i have some very great news from corporate.
we had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
congratulations.
you see that?
you see how they responded to me?
in that moment, i had them.
no, no!
it is not true.
i was just talking so just go out there and say anything.
they will eat it up.
they are a great audience.
he is kidding.
dwight was kidding and i do not know why because it was not funny... and it was just horrible.
yeah.
all right.
everybody in the conference room now.
let us go.
let us do it.
as your leader and your friend, i sort of demand that you can all speak in public as i can... and did... twice.
you saw the plaque, right?
all right.
we are all going to go around the room and we are going to make toasts.
and that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
pam!
I am public speaking.
stop public interrupting me.
actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
yes.
good.
jim taking the initiative.
oh ho hokay.
you know what?
that is not a toast.
you are not standing up.
okay, dwight.
show us what you have learned today.
well, it is mostly made up.
so... dwight is not going to do a job.
it is sad.
and they are expecting excellence because i did do such a good job.
two years in a row.
i killed.
it was amazing.
confidence, dwight.
it is time, dwight.
the grim reaper is here.
all right.
you ready?
here we go!
wow.
it is a little bit bigger than i remember.
come on.
we are down here.
right.
dwight, they called your name.
all right.
you know what?
okay.
no.
no problem.
you are lucky you have me here.
I am going to cover for you.
all right!
gooood morning, vietnaaaam!
i am not dwight schrute.
not at all.
i am michael scott, his mentor and boss.
and until dwight comes up, if he ever does, i wanted to say a few words about excellence.
what makes a work environment excellent?
well, there are many things, i believe, that do such a thing of that nature.
and one would be humor.
what is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
I am very sorry.
i did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and i just thought you were speaking abnormally.
...and now the black guy from the 'police academy' movies.
a robot.
michael winslow, anyone?
car starting.
all right, dwight schrute everyone.
good luck.
that is a tough crowd.
i got thirsty.
how did it go?
you would not believe what happened here.
oh!
this woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink.
the bartender asked for her id which i thought was odd because i pegged her at like 35. yeah, it was weird.
so, she was like 'i do not have my id, please give me one.' and he was like 'i can not do that.
i can not serve you.' she might have been.
so she says 'fine.
i will go to my room.
i will get my purse.
i will come back.
I will show you my id.' she has not come back yet.
she is probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar!
right?
dwight gave a great speech.
that is the word on the street anyway.
and i entertained dwight to no end with my bar stories.
so, i captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys.
can you believe that?
a thousand guys?
that is it?
you are going to end with "etcetera"?
okay, what is this big organizational system that... that would be suicide.
never, never talk specifics.
not in a speech.
but the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
it is your delivery... our biggest worry.
my god, dwight.
the best way to learn is by watching.
that is why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry.
listen.
okay.
sit down, let me wow you.
see, i have your attention now, do not i?
you are scared, but now you are ready to learn.
no, it did not.
and that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor.
we will find you a joke that not even you can ruin.
all right, listen up, please.
dwight has a joke.
iraq is sand.
sailors are on water.
yeah, well, you know what?
we need to... all right, everybody in the conference room now.
let us go.
anything your heart desires.
louder!
good.
good, good, good.
that is good.
now see, that is not so hard, right?
all right.
who is next?
who are we going to... ryan.
ryan's next.
do not be shy, shy boy.
do not be shy.
get up there.
stop!
stop!
stop!
that is, you know what?
the toast is really not supposed to be about anything.
it is certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so... ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time.
am i worried about that?
try scared to death.
numismatic.
numismatic collectors.
nope, wrong room.
okay.
they got sports medicine seminar, nope.
science fiction convention, nope.
you are weird.
are you a 12-year-old girl?
i do not know.
there we go.
pam.
ms. beasley if yer nastay!
janet jackson.
hey!
you having a wardrobe malfunction there?
or w-- ... oh, god is that today?
listen, i like kids.
but this is not a kid's environment.
this is like hbo, no limits.
who knows what I am going to say?
crazy stuff.
and it is r rated, it is not rated g. i am like eddie murphy in "raw," and they are trying to make me into eddie murphy in "daddy daycare." both great movies, but, still.
well, I will be in my office.
they are cool.
fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
hi, children.
I am michael scott, and... i... am in charge of this place... ahh, what will make you... understand... i am... like superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of gotham city.
okay, I am aquaman.
where does he live, guys?
i work with a bunch of nerds.
oh, yes, hello, how are you?
good to see you.
wow, you have really grown up.
you know what?
do not mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox.
better keep the... frat boys away from her.
oh.
yeah, middle school's amazing.
it is extraordinary.
an extraordinary time.
it is not that children make me uncomfortable, it is just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle?
I have never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
they want how many spiral pads?
okay.
just compare last year's order to this year's.
uh-huh.
yeah, I am looking at it right now.
... yes.
we-yeah, they are very-they are different.
yeah, we can stick with last year's, you are just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
yes.
well... we can...  uhm... hey, uh, you know what?
can i call you back?
I will call you right back.
yes, i promise.
...hello, can i help you?
... you can pick that up, if you want.
that is-- that is alright.
want to bring it over... here, make some room.
my name's michael.
what is your name?
nice to meet you.
oh, you know what that is!
that is a train whistle, like I am the conductor.
but I am sort of the conductor of the office here, right?
you want to try?
all aboard for sales!
next stop, cu...camonga!
dwight!
dwight!
what the hell are you reading to them?
yeah, you know what?
no, no no no no.
they, no.
the kids do not want to hear some wierdo book that your nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
what is a nazi?
do not!
do not!
do not!
do not talk about nazis in front of-- you know what?
they are going to have nightmares, so why do not you just shut it?
why do not you just leave?
okay?
alright.
there goes mister poop.
now, who likes dane cook?
children cannot lie.
they are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, michael scott is freaking cool.
this is where the magic happens!
right over here, let me show you this.
see all these?
you know what that is?
that is paper.
this is where paper comes from.
any questions?
no, we do not actually cut the paper.
that is a good question.
the paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
yes it is, well, w-w-you need someone in the middle to facilitate... I am not just a middle... man... you are describing office depot, and they are kind of running us out of business.
...there is creed!
let us take a look at what he is doing, everybody!
this is creed, and he is in charge of... something.
right?
say hi to the kids.
yaaaaay.
what are you doing?
n-stop it!
stop it!
just-no, no, no, no!
no!
would you cut it out?!
what is your problem?
no no no, we are not going to see-- we are not going to see the four toed... creed, okay?
you know, there is something interesting about me you might want to know.
i ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
it is true.
i did.
i am totally serious.
there was a show called 'fundle bundle' and i was the star.
it is true!
i can prove it!
i can prove it, watch this.
ryan, can you come here a second?
i would like you to go to my mother's house in dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, i want you to boost yourself up, i want you to go down to the basement.
in the basement is a tape labeled 'fundle bundle'.
i want you to grab it, i want you to get my guitar.
i want you to get the tambourine.
do you know how to play the tambourine?
oka- okay!
thank you ryan.
good attitude, hottest in the office.
alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
i do not get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids.
you joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... they are adults, for god's sake.
i am going to give you a little blast from the past of michael gary scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'fundle bundle.' okay?
without further ado, ryan?
that... is miss trudy.
can not tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body.
okay, you can... fast forward.
and... i want you... to... stop!
stop!
stop!
yes!
that is, uh, edward r. meow.
yeah.
uhh, i do not know.
can everyone please shut up, please!
so you do not miss it.
oh!
that is me.
shh.
shh.
coulda sworn there was... ...uh, no.
uh, just never happened.
uh, nope.
i do okay.
yes.
okay!
alright, okay.
...i guess not... you know, i have a load of work to do so i am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I am going to go do my work.
bye.
yeah?
oh, that is okay, she can keep those.
thank you.
you have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
well, sure, playing the field is great, do not get me wrong, but there is more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
what about... ...january
kay.
...or biologically.
thanks, that is, no, that... that really means a lot to me.
hey, does sasha have a godfather, because i... oh... kay.
yes, it is true.
i, michael scott, am signing up with an online dating service.
thousands of people have done it, and i am going to do it.
i need a username.
and... i have a great one .
little kid lover.
that way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
hey, uh, no, please?
you can not leave yet.
there is still one more thing we need to do.
you... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by...  and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well... one more time.
you... hey, do not touch him, please!
did not do background checks of the warehouse guys.
well, I am sure it will be fine.
sure.
okay.
there you go.
so, phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now i am recruiting you.
do not worry about phil.
he drives a corvette.
he is doing just fine.
okay.
calling cards are... the wave of the future.
these things sell themselves.
you know what?
that is a nice attitude, ryan, I am just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
yes!
thank you!
you will get rich quick.
we all will!
you know what, toby?
when the son of the deposed king of nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help!
his father ran the freaking country, okay?
...alright, so, raise your hand if you want to get rich.
alright.
alright, let me explain.
again.
phil has recruited me and another guy.
now, we are getting three people each.
the more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we are all going to make.
it is not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it is not even a scheme per se, it is...  ... i have to go make a call.
oh ho ho!
what?
thank you!
that is really nice.
today is my b-day, and people around here just go crazy for it.
i do not know why.
oh!
fun fact.
i share my birthday with eva longoria.
so, i have a <i>perfect</i> ice-breaker if i ever meet terry hatcher.
what is up?
ah, thank you sir.
yeah.
ohh, god.
no no no, no, new suit, please.
thank you very much.

nope!

spoil the surprise.
let us get the party started.

yeah?
oh, great, put her through.
hey, you.
it is urgent, i just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.

...you can take a five, if you want.
somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!

and, um, some singles, if you will!
allllright.
nnnnn-dink!
okay, um, alright.
this has arms.
is that going to be a... is that alright?
okay.
I am so nervous.
when i was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... i got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and i had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and i never came outside.
and by the time i got out the pony was already in the truck.
and around the corner.
so that was my worst birthday.
stop it.
stop!
what is that?
yeah, well, it is on the radio.
my birthday blows.
nobody even signed my birthday poster.
probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
you are making it worse.
i bet luke perry's friends do not treat him like this .
what?
ohhh, god.
ohhh, no.
ohh, no, no, no!
i can not... ryan, come on.
let us do this.
okay.
thank you.
whoa whoa!
alright.
alright.

yes.
well, then just have the tomato and ketchup.

get whatever you want.
and choke on it.
when i was sixteen, i was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named julie.
but there was another michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday.
and, she got him a cake, at the restaurant.
and it was not even his birthday, but i heard about it the next day in school.
so... <i>that</i> was the worst birthday i think i ever had.
kevin?
respect the birthday please.
are you done?
...good.
okay.
uhhh... blow out the candle.
okay.
mmmm... ... i asked for trick candles.
okay.
well, when she comes back we will do it again.
hello, what about the birthday boy?
have not had a hug all day.
... aww, that... sucks, great.
... wow, that is good timing.
that is... that is, sorry, that is terrible.
terrible news.
that is terrible... terrible news for both of us .
there you are.
good news.
did some research.
it turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
yeah, but it is not brain cancer.
and it should not stop us from having fun.
you know what they say the best medicine is.
and laughter... also.
why are you here?
i did not even invite you to my birthday party.
nyeh, i work here.
alright, well, you know what, since toby does not speak for everybody and i am your boss, i... think you should just go home.
take the rest of the afternoon off.
take a sick day.
well, you are pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
excuse me, everyone.
attention please.
kevin, we are going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
how dare you sir.
you are gross.
that should not be there.
no, it is alright.
it is already up.
just leave it.
where is kevin?
come on!
let us get our skate on!
yeah, I have been pretty much skating my whole life.
i thought about playing in the nhl, but, you are on the road so much.
you got no time to spend with your wife and kids.
and i really want a wife and kids.
hey pam, all this stuff with kevin... um, it is pretty scary.
and I am thinking that uh, next time you are in the shower, you should check yourself out.
you know, give yourself an exam.
those things are like ticking time bags.
alright?
think about it.
kevin.
you heard anything yet?
okay.
well.
live strong.
alright.
yeah.
carol?
she sold me my condo!
hey!
what, is this place on the market?
or... oh, these... all your kids?
oh, hey guys.
what is up?
you want to go for a ride?
is that okay?
cool.
alright.
grab on.
here we go.
ready?
hang on tight.
alright.
we are moving.
we are reaaallly mooovin' now!
push.
good!
that is great.
you got it.
excuse me.
oh... god...  god!
we are going to beat this, okay?
we are going to... come here .
well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good.
which makes absolutely no sense.
in the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
okay, who is this from?
wowwwee, look at that!
jersey!
cool.
ohh.
great.
from dwight.
thank you... dwight.
that is great.
thanks.
yeah.
oh!
you did not need to do that.
...nightswept.
this is... really amazing.
thank you.
i love it.
that is not how i taught you, right?
my hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump check it out good.
great.
no, i think you are going to stay.
oh, good.
okay.
do not tell me, tell them.
oh, my god.
that is a piece of cake.
that is a piece of cake.
oh, 2%.
jeez, that is good.
out of, like, 18 billion americans, so, no worry.
those were probably misdiagnosed.
i mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, "i have cancer." untrue.
the heart is bigger than the skin.
if you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
ry, is he bugging you?
dwight, dude, you got to take a chill pill, man.
it was one joint in the parking lot.
you know, you are totally harshing the office mellow.
narc!
i was not attempting to compliment you.
uuf, well... okay... why do not you just cool it, cool it dwight, please, god!
dude, where is my office?
i totally lost it, because i was half-baked.
smokin' doobies.
doobie brothers, i was smokin' doobies with my brothers.
peace out, seacrest!
thanks.
m-m-munchies.
who wants some munchies?
uh-oh.
uh-oh.
who is he calling?
ratting somebody out.
narc!
narc!
kevin?
remember the narc bit?
uh-oh, who is in trouble?
waa... what?
what are you talking about?
two nights ago, i went to an alicia keys concert at the montage mountain performing arts center.
i scored these great aisle seats.
anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and i never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one.
i do not know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I am sure that it was clove cigarettes.
everybody in the aisle was doing it.
okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.
instead, i will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
i can do that, it is my office.
hmmm.
ha.
alright.
great.
it has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
no, uh, no.
that was a test.
i was testing you, and you all failed.
miserably.
when i said that dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?
how many of you said, "hey, you know what, he is right?
what he is doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs." i am ridiculously anti-drug.
so anti-drug that i am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
drugs ruin lives people.
drugs destroy careers.
take cheech and chong everybody knows that cheech and chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they did not smoke pot.
i want everybody to take a look to their left.
now i want everybody to take a look to their right.
one of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives.
this year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
do you think that smoking drugs is cool?
do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
okay, enough, enough, enough!
i have written down a list of illegal drugs.
take a gander.
how many of these are you familiar with?
yes it is.
okay, you know what, toby?
pam, can you take this down?
in addition to toby's urine being tested, i would like to test his blood and his hair.
i can test anyone randomly, and i have chosen you randomly.
okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.
okay, you know what?
I am going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.
yeah, pam.
really?
jim it is okay.
you can t...  this would be a good place to let it out, jim.
these are people you can trust.
these are people who care about you.
it is okay, just we will not judge you.
we are here to not judge you.
oh, he is doing it, okay.
it is okay.
oh.
okay, are you sure?
that looked like it was going to be good.
alright.
okay, well.
the point I am trying to make with all of this people is that i hate drugs.
i hate them, and based upon what i have seen you all do not quite hate  them as much as i do so you are going to have a drug test, and i am not.
yes, i will not be.
okay, well dwight just know that I have been very busy today and i got a lot of work to do and i was not planning on going to the bathroom and i do not even know if anything is going to come out, okay?
so good.
thank you.
so i need you to do some work on the st. andrews account.
i need your urine.
i need some filing done.
just forget it.
just the urine.
just.
i need your urine.
yes in a cup, we are not animals, dwight.
it is none of your business.
okay.
alright.
just, i went to an alicia keys concert, over the weekend, and i think i may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
i need clean urine for the lady.
do not think of it that way.
it is like, urine goes all over the place.
you know, there is no controlling it.
it just... goes a cup could find its way under the urine.
it might be an accident.
it happens.
no, just look.
look.
just... just fill up the cup.
dwight.
well, i passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee.
thank you very much.
what is wrong?
where is your costume?
why?
wha... since you did such a good job with the investigation, i decided to pull a few strings.
call in a few favors.
and I have decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
yes, sir.
so you want to?
thanks.
okay.
good.
no.
oh.
uh... alright.
well, thank you.
exactly.
i know.
it is amazing.
shut... shut it.
no.
just... just focus on the facts.
cocaine.
they use cocaine.
no, no!
your instinct.
that... your gut reaction is to say that, but i do not!
that is, that is... those are instincts that have been created by media and hype.
and they are wrong.
what i am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are.
it may be the person you least suspect.
it may be somebody hot, like pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like phyllis, but just not me.
no?
okay, fine.
okay, well, i really think that... yeah.
sorry you had to hear that.
it was a lovers' quarrel.
okay, let us get personal for a second, shall we?
well... i do not... let us just not talk about it, okay?
yes, thanks, fantastic sam's.
adult cut plus.
comes with a shampoo and blow dry.
we are doing i.d.
photos today.
got to represent.
that is a nice tie.
that is... who makes that?
do you mind if i wear that for the photo?
what is the dealio?
what is the problem?
so what, you are having a little spat.
i forget, are you guys dating?
yes.
yeah?
okay.
what do you know about conflict resolution?
your answer to everything is to get divorced.
so... okay... what?
yeah, well... that is not going to fly here.
because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we do not get downsized.
uh, pam, will you get angela and meet us in the conference room please?
a mediator's tool chest.
okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.
my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
no.
okay, this is important.
the first style is lose/lose.
just hold on, please!
okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want.
do you understand?
you... you would both lose.
now i need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
win/win is number four and number five is win/win/win.
the important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win.
me too.
i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
okay, since this is the disputed poster.
now, one at a time, i want you to express your feelings using "i" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements.
come on, seriously, that?
okay, okay.
stop, stop, stop!
let us see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
yes.
thank you, pam.
how about angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which oscar wears.
that way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar, she can see it.
win/win/win.
okay... well, brainstorm.
own the solution.
okay, that is called a compromise.
and it is style 3. and it is not ideal.
to sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - tuesdays and thursdays.
and the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt!
win/win.
it is done!
yes.
are those all the other complains?
i would like to see those please.
you can not do that, huh?
huh, ok. now you and i have a conflict.
i order you to give me that file.
okay.
there!
no more conflict.
i had to use win/lose on that.
it was not pretty.
all right... is that it?
ohh... god.
alright.
why do i have to do everything?
this is from kevin.
he says stanley uses his miracle whip without asking.
meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright.
creed... huh.
duh, duh.
creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
you will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
how many of you have at one time gone to toby to complain about another employee?
and... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?
that is outrageous!
i love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved.
alright, how about the phyllis/angela dispute?
that is what she said.
the thing is, angela... you are in here an awful lot.
you have complained about everybody in the office, except dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with dwight.
toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean?
there is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?
oh, ok. there were a bunch of complaints about dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
all right, pamela.
come on down!
let us do it!
and ... okay.
just one complaint.
actually, it has been withdrawn.
so that is no help to us.
next.
uh... "does she have to plan her wedding on office time?
could not she do that at home?"  who else?
why do not we just warm up first?
warm up emotionally, all right?
here is a kelly complaint: "ryan never returns my calls." ugh, join the club.
makin' progress.
yes?
what?!
stanley.
you got a lot of anger under there buddy.
come on start us out.
unleash it.
someone complained that the men's room is "whites only".
stanley, you know that is not true.
okay, phyllis.
you complained that angela's giving you dirty looks.
and you tried to get off the party planning committee.
and... also, phyllis, stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
oh... ok. okay, well... all settled, then.
ok, ryan.
you told toby that creed has a distinct old man smell?
all right, kevin.
you are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to angela that made her feel uncomfortable.
solution:  angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
uh.
dwight.
okay!
calm down.
hey, hey!
stop.
okay... dwight... stop... oh... kay... okay.
yes.
mm-hmm.
you know your i.d.
says you are a security threat?
okay... you two, in the conference room with me.
nobody leaves until we work this out.
cage match!
cage matches?
yeah, they work.
how could they not work?
if they did not work, everybody would still be in the cage.
okay, so dwight, in your own words -  "someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons.
i suspect jim halpert."  "everyone has called me 'dwayne' all day.
i think jim halpert paid them to." "this morning, i found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and jim halpert tried to convince me i committed murder.
i think he may be the real murderer."  "jim halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room.
when i went to save the child, i saw meredith on the can."  gah.
"this morning, i knocked myself in the head with the phone." "every time i typed my name, it said 'diapers'." "by the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier." the japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard.
and it is very painful.
and apparently, some people throw up.
but the next day they feel great.
I have never had one.
they sound awful.
hey, there is like, 300 more of these.
let us get to them later.
maybe, i have not decided yet.
let us get to work.
okay.
oh... actually, tomorrow's not good.
how about later in the week?
good.
okay.
hey!
wait.
how about a group picture while you are here?
well... that is... what, a computer camera, right?
it will take like two seconds.
ugh... all right.
everybody,  come on.
group photo for the newsletter.
come on, everybody.
we resolved a lot today, everybody.
think happy thoughts.
good, let us check that out.
ew, okay, all right.
one more.
we will take one more.
what?
you just press the button.
okay, good.
check that out.
that is terrible.
let us pay mr. price gouger.
okay... we can do this.
come on, everybody.
all right.
here we go.
it was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people.
he would not give me a good discount.
and eight tries added up.
one, two.. did not say three, did i?
but, I am sort of an expert at photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end.
when people work together, there is going to be conflict.
you can not outrun your problems.
and that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing.
but here is the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage.
and that is something toby will never understand.
on big brother, something important happens every day.
but real life is not like that.
tonight the scranton business park is having casino night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall.
and i know it is illegal in pennsylvania, but it is for charity.
and i consider myself a great philanderer.
it is just... it is nice to know at the end of the day, i can look in the mirror and say, "michael, because of you, some little kid in the congo has a belly full of rice this evening." makes you feel good.
i try not to think of it as lagging behind.
it is more of a david-and-goliath thing.
top 80 percent!
yeah?
jan, listen, i promise that i will kick it up a notch.
bam!
emeril.
oh, actually, while i have you, not that i have you or have ever had you, but we are having our casino night tonight and i think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
i am, but you are the eva peron to my cesar chavez.
oh, come on.
come on.
you know, it would be fun.
i can hear it in your voice.
you need a break.
jan and i understand each other.
the romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we have remained good friends.
good friends with privileges.
not now, some day.
okay, everybody.
tonight's event is to benefit the boy scouts of america.
well, they need our money.
they do not have cookies like the girl scouts.
well, oscar, if you do not like it, then you should concentrate on winning.
because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice.
and they will get a mini-fridge compliments of vance refrigeration.
so get your charities in to pam.
i, for example, am playing for comic relief.
comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
well, then, they need our money more than ever.
oh, and another fun thing.
we, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of boy scouts.
right, toby?
we are going to... why are you the way that you are?
honestly, every time i try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way.
i hate so much about the things that you choose to be.
okay, you know what?
i will not donate my winnings to comic relief, since apparently it does not exist.
i am going to donate to afghanistanis with aids.
no, i mean afghanistanis with aids.
what?
that is a dog.
that is a shawl.
no.
humans with aids.
okay, you know what?
no.
no.
aids is not funny.
believe me, i have tried.
there are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, jfk, aids, the holocaust.
the lincoln assassination just recently became funny.
"i need to see this play like i need a hole in the head."  and i hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious aids joke.
it is one of my dreams.
i have already put down the deposit.
do you understand how a deposit works?
it is casino night like las vegas.
there are fire-eaters all over the place.
well, actually, it is my warehouse.
why are you here?
not.
i said, not that.
that is ironic.
that you are afraid.
dinkin' flicka.
give me some.
yes who?
do i know a carol stills?
oh, yeah, put her through.
hey carol, how goes the real estate biz?
is it <i>real</i> good?
hi, carol.
how you doing?
oh, hey, no problemo.
incidentally, i love the place.
great.
it has a little bit of a weird smell.
it is okay.
at christmas, the tree helped.
actually, I am sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, casino night.
yeah, it will be good.
you know what?
why do not you come by?
bring the papers, I will sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
yeah.
it will be fun.
what do you... what do you... oh, I am sorry.
could you hold on?
yes?
okay, put her through.
jan levinson, i presume?
hey, january how you doing?
i am?
oh, okay.
aids.
okay, sounds great.
bye hello, carol?
hi, sorry about that.
i just... right.
yeah?
what?
okay.
problem.
good.
good, all right.
sounds great.
bye.
two queens on casino night.
i am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
hey, hey.
hey, carol.
you look great.
oh, well... kiss.
that is how we do it in the paper biz.
it is european and... yes?
ah, dwight can i get you a drink?
the food is from hooters.
okay.
billy, your nurse is hot.
your nurse became your girlfriend?
sweet.
chili's is great.
welkommen, bienvenue, and welcome to monte carlo!
dwight.
i am no longer your boss.
lady fortune is your boss.
shut it, shut it, shut it.
will lady fortune be your mistress?
only time will tell, my friends.
leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door.
old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!
welcome all!
great, okay.
shuffle up and deal.
let us get it started!
black-eyed crows.
all-in.
bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I am not very good at bluffing.
did you believe me?
what are... that is insane.
well, toby, i went all-in on the first hand, so does not that tell you that i might have good cards, too?
so do not be stupid.
just take it back.
okay, all right, whatever.
you really screwed that up.
yeah, whatever.
hey, you know what?
if luck were not involved, i would always be winning.
oh, my god.
oh, my god.
january look, okay, i think we are all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
after you said you were not coming, i invited carol to come and i do not think that i did anything wrong.
um... hey.
what... all right!
four!
blow.
blow for luck!
yeah!
also, you.
not playing favorites.
all right, here we go!
yeah!
so close.
so close.
hey, okay.
thank you.
okay.
thanks for coming.
okay.
talk to you monday.
good night.
she is a good boss.
oh, she is great.
love triangle.
drama.
all worked out in the end, though.
the hero got the girl.
who saw that coming?
i did.
and jan was really happy for me.
so actually the hero got two girls.
he got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from.
so, I have got my new york girl and my local flavor.
life is good.
no.
no.
i want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
good.
yes, that will work.
all right.
now i need a plural noun.
how about a location?
where the hell is that?
okay, all right.
no, no, no.
no, no, not until you give me an adjective.
we already have that.
so... no, toby, damn it, come on!
we already have that.
i need something fun.
something like fat or smelly.
or pukey.
pukey.
pukey's good.
okay.
pukey.
now i need a noun.
good.
thank you, phyllis.
that was not so hard.
all right, here we go.
"office depot is an annoying store.
one day creed went there to buy paper.
and he ran into irritating cylons." "one of them was named michael scott, and he was an..." oh, damn it.
okay.
okay, okay, we are... okay, we are starting over.
dang!
paper making paper, i.e.
money.
paper money.
yeah.
the company's doing fine.
hey.
okay.
you know what?
do not even think.
i command you to just go down and have fun tonight.
all right?
do not think about it.
our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in scranton.
hardworking, motivated, dynamic.
every single last one of them.
they follow my lead.
i sort of set the tone.
and it does not hurt that my ex works for corporate.
jan loves this branch, and i think that is really more than half the battle.
no!
that is the fun of this place.
i call everybody "faggie".
why would anybody find that offensive?
that is what faggie means!
it was not just an action movie, it was die hard!
exactly!
yeah, i know.
ok, a little too far, crossed the line.
i would have never called him that if i knew.
you do not... you do not call retarded people "retards".
it is bad taste.
you call your friends "retards" when they are acting retarded.
and i consider oscar a friend.
listen man, i am so sorry.
i had no idea.
no.
no it is not.
i feel terrible about it.
i have been calling people "faggie" since i was in junior high, and i have never made this mistake.
if i do not know how to behave, it is because i am just so far the opposite way, you know?
I am just... i, i can not even imagine... the... thing.
maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.
and you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
can you tell who is gay and who is not?
what about oscar?
well, he <i>is</i>.
there could be others...  i need to know.
i do not want to offend anybody else.
yeah, I am sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
hey, what about angela?
she is hard and severe.
she could be a gay woman.
i do not know, i can imagine her with another woman, can not you?
do some research.
find out if there is a way to tell by just looking at them.
that is ridiculous.
let us call him and get the website.
well, they are sold out.
i watch the l word.
i watch, queer as f***, so... what?
what does that even... well, gay pride, right?
gay pride parade?
it is not like gay... shame festival.
i think angela might be gay.
could oscar and angela be having a gay affair?
maybe!
is that what this is about?
i do not kn- anything's possible.
well, I am not gay jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
the company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
trick question!
because you can not always tell, so... how would i know.
is that the right answer?
nothing wrong with this stuff.
at all.
this is fine.
you know what.
gay porn, straight porn, it is all goooooood!
i do not particularly get into this.
but uh, you know what.
i totally see the merit!
and actually... it is quite beautiful.
all right, everybody in the conference room!
i do not care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!
just get in here!
right now!
did you know that gay used to mean happy?
when i was growing up it meant lame.
and now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
we are all homos!
homosapiens.
gays are not necessarily who you think they are, people.
i mean anybody could be gay.
business-men.
like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.
oscar, why do not you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.
however you want to do it.
go ahead.
stand up.
I am doing this for you.
who should be the judges and juries of our society?
yes, that is a good point.
she has a good point.
because gay marriage currently is not legal, under you.s. law.
i bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.
so they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.
you know?
sounds pretty good, right?
that is great.
congratulations phyllis.
that is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!
see?
everybody has a chance!
but still, phyllis, in college?
did you ever experiment with other women?
a lot of women do!
right!
and i take that as a compliment.
well, i just like to look good ok, so -- no, i am just coming out myself.
i am coming out hetero!
no no no.
the only signal that i am sending is: <i>gay, good</i>.
look, if i was gay, i would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.
i would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... i would be waving that rainbow flag.
you misunderstand- ok.  you know what, ok.  i uh, I am going to put my money where my mouth is.
you ready?
i am going to embrace oscar.
you might want to watch this angela, because you can not catch anything.
here we go.
we are going to make a statement.
you and i are going to make a statement together.
oscar is my friend -- ...and i just do not care who sees it, does not bother me!
all right, um... sorry.
I am sorry i called you faggie.
you are not faggie.
you are a a good guy.
you know what, I am going to raise the stakes.
i want you to watch this.
and i want you to burn this into your brains.
because this is an image that i want you people to remember for a long time to come.
whenever you come into the office i want you to think about this.
i did it.
see.
I am still here.
we are all still here.
oh come on!
dwight!
come on, man!
we are not in the playground anymore.
there are new rules.
we have to be mature.
but we can not lose the spirit of child like wonder.
what is love...  anyway?
maybe it is supposed to break all the rules.
like me and january  or oscar... and some guy.
life is short.
when two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
i am glad that today spurred social change.
that is part of my job as regional manager.
but you know what?
even if it did not, at least we put this matter to bed.
...that is what she said.
or he said.
oh, there is gill.
oscar's roommate.
i wonder if he knows?
i will do my job to the best of my abilities.
i will do my <i>regional manager</i> job to the best of my <i>cap</i>ability.
specifically, jan, i will make at least ten phone calls to clients.
yes, i have to begin every day by letting jan know what i intend to accomplish, and then i have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what i <i>did</i> accomplish.
but it is not mandatory.
it is something that i... wanted to do... and so it is voluntary, really.
even though she... makes me.
i think she just wants to hear my voice.
because we are no longer lovers, and she is just hurting.
but things are going well with carol.
I have seen her seven times in the last few months, and I am growing very fond of her kids.
tommy, who i call tomas, and the little girl... no.
okay.
hi, honey.
you holding up?
yeah.
oh, good.
by yourself?
aw.
well, hang in there, okay?
you know what?
you should get one of this big body pillows.
that way you would not miss you-know-who so much.
roy.
pam?
did you see oprah yesterday?
i, uh... i am going to be a father.
angelina jolie was on.
and she adopted a baby from asia, and she said that it changed her life.
and that really inspired me.
so, i want you to look into seeing how much a little chinese baby would cost.
i know.
well... just do it, okay?
um... find out if there is a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
eight months?
i do not even know if I will want a baby in eight months.
you know what, pam?
if in ten years, i have not had a baby, and you have not had a baby... twenty years.
thirty.
it is a deal.
yesh.
right there.
ah.
per diem.
guess where i am going.
i will give you a hint.
it is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes.
you are correct, sir!
i am headed to philadelphia for the annual northeastern mid-market office supply convention.
and jim halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun.
poor little guy.
he is been stuck working under josh, the poor man's michael scott, as he is known around my condo.
sleep with who?
whom, whom... whom?
oh, wow!
oh my god, i have a great idea.
you know what you should do to be hilarious?
wear your wedding dress.
it would be a great icebreaker.
yeah, do it!
really?
okay.
well, word of advice: unbutton that top button.
let those things breathe.
any message you want me to relate to jim?
um.
okay, um.
you got that?
write it down.
um.
hey, josh, how ya doing?
good to see you.
there he is!
there is the traitor!
traitor!
traitor!
come here, you.
come here!
yeah!
the product... the progidal... my son returns.
i was shocked when he told me he was transferring to stamford.
it is like the firemen.
you do not leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in connecticut.
yeah!
wow, i did not expect that.
it is good to see you too!
hey!
ah.
jan?
look, i think we need to set some ground rules.
the eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room.
carol.
I am still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
thank you for being so brave with all of this.
thank you.
i know!
that is specifically why i chose a room close to the elevator.
more foot traffic.
that is crooked on that side.
hey hey!
yeah.
well, that is how we do it in scranton.
or did you forget?
there are not no party like a scranton party, because a scranton party do not stop.
hey, well, we have time!
one for the road, gentlemen?
wish i was.
i love inside jokes.
I would love to be a part of one someday.
all right, see you guys down there.
change your mind, come back up.
ugh, that would be gross.
it is not even lunch yet.
swag!
stuff we all get.
i basically decorated my condo for free with all of my swag.
check it out.
hi, I am michael scott, dunder-mifflin.
you know what?
I am having a huge blowout tonight, room 308. hope you can come.
well, cool!
okay, so... can i tell people you are going to be there?
so maybe.
see ya.
because he is afraid to fly.
do you remember me from last year?
there is a party in my room, 308, can not miss it, right off the elevator.
tonight.
be there!
yep.
yeah, she is up front.
i do not have to, i just know.
yes, hello?
see you in a bit.
bye-bye.
may i have a moment of your time please?
i need you to do something for me.
i want you to dig up some dirt on josh.
find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
and?
business has been pretty crazy around the office.
yeah.
moved ryan over to your desk.
i will call him later with that message.
toby flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry.
is he why you left?
opportunity, promotion, blah, blah.
you know, jim, those are just words.
have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses?
is josh funnier than i am?
does he even have a girlfriend?
because i have two, basically.
hey, jan, jan?
do not worry, i have got the tip.
you are welcome.
no, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
i have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
the party I am having tonight in 308. obviously, you are invited.
any messages for 308?
all right.
hey hey, fellers.
what is up?
hey, check this out.
how about that?
a little friendly competition.
stamford versus scranton.
oh, jim.
looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
okay!
excellent.
oh... shut it.
hey, pam, what is up?
yep, yech... no.
tell him i will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay?
yes.
say hi to pam!
yes.
that is josh and dwight and jim.
pam says hi.
have fun on your date!
very good, talk to you later.
bye.
you first.
not.
it hit the rim.
okay, and... okay.
double or nothing.
well, let us... come on!
come on!
fine.
jim and i have different definitions of friendship.
i think it is talking and being friends, and jim thinks it is moving to connecticut and being best friends with josh.
well, phooey on that.
i, uh, I am done.
i am not going to be speaking with him anymore.
whatevs.
long-distance relationships never work.
okay, let me tell you what we are looking for.
sorry, my meeting ran late.
yes, jan, really.
with a rep from hammermill.
used to be.
evan will call you in the morning to work out the details.
we can now sell hammermill products.
yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
hey, first guest!
you are going to have some tequila, my friend.
this is the party.
party central!
so, what can i do you for?
all right.
people have been filtering in and out.
what?
sure.
you like cosmos?
sure, sounds good.
so why are you here?
is josh busy?
i get it!
no, no, i totally get it.
he made a better paper airplane, stamford is better in sales... i get it.
we had some fun.
we had some laughs.
and that is just... I am not better than josh.
oh my god.
you do not even know.
she is single now.
I am sorry, man.
I am sorry.
hey, you know what?
i will talk to her.
yeah.
i will.
I will talk to her.
you should at least talk to roy.
i mean, he knows exactly how you are feeling.
hey!
no, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
evan, this is jim.
hey, ernie, how ya doing?
best friends.
some people need dozens of friends to say, "hey, look at me, I am popular." but not me.
I am very picky.
i need three, maybe two.
when you meet that someone special, you will just know.
because a real relationship, it... it can not be forced.
it should just come about effortlessly.
now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?
ha, ha, ha.
whoa.
what are those stains?
oh, god, i hope it is urine.
today I am headed to philadelphia for the annual northeastern office supply convention.
wooo-yaaaaah!
oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.
ah.
per-diem.
perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm!
you know, ryan, it is all about the benjamins.
right there.
yes.
what?
oh, yeah, have pam give those to me.
sure you do not want to come?
going to be fun!
change your mind we can get you a cot.
a couple of years ago, i went to one in hartford.
"connecticut." and todd packer and i went to this bar and met a girl.
and  packer decides to make out with her.
turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar.
i love this.
the bouncer chases us out to packer's vette, jump in the vette, he <i>peels out</i>, and i  i do not make it to the car.
um, and the other bouncers caught up with me and really did a number on me... it was in the paper...  but to answer your question, yeah, I am really excited about this weekend.
see that factory?
i almost worked there.
yup.
yeah, i applied for a job there.
i was going to be a bottle capper.
i know, i know.
crazy world.
crazy, crazy world.
josh reminds me of a guy i went to high school with.
big football star, girls loved him.
whatever.
guess what he is doing now.
he is a tv announcer for the eagles.
up in the...  he does not even get to play in the game, i mean.
ahhhhhhhhh.
I am hungry.
movie monday!
the only cure i know for the monday blues is... varsity blues!
let us gooooo!
let us go, let us go, let us go!
alright, everybody here?
yes.
yes pleeeeease!
thank yooouuu!
entourage!
kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
do not whine.
get the window.
previously on varsity blues... hi jan!
hope you brought the milk duds!
people work faster after... no... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
ok. ouchy.
three hours, wow.
have fun.
hi.
oh.
that is nice.
...what?
...you were at the dentist?
ok. what was dwight thinking?
that he could turn jan against me?
she is my ex-lover!
...ish.
hey dwight.
do you want an m&amp;m?
no seriously.
you should have an m&amp;m, they are really good.
they are good, huh?
hey.
i thought you were not supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you have had a crown put in.
sounds like a good dentist.
what is his name?
your dentist's name is crentist.
huh.
sounds a lot like dentist.
let me see your teeth.
let me see  them.
let me see  them.
you should... floss.
well then... i am glad you are ok. business is like a jungle.
and i... am like a tiger.
and dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.
does the tiger fire the monkey?
does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?
pun.
there is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head.
we do not have the technology.
dwight, can i talk to you for a second?
wow, this is tough.
ohhhh.
arrrgggh!
well, i just got off the phone with january  and um... she demoted me.
yeah.
you know what the craziest part of this is?
she demoted me to your job!
and she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, i guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of dunder mifflin, scranton.
i know.
i told her i did not know whether you would want to do it... because you have always been so loyal to me.
you have been my most trusted ally.
yep, i did.
i did.
but i think... you should do it.
perfect, well, we are settled.
all right.
well then, you are now acting manager of dunder mifflin scranton branch, and i... am assistant regional manager.
ohh.. can not you?
that is so nice.
well... i guess we should go tell the troops.
hey, hi, hello.
everybody, i have some good news, and i have some bad news.
i... am being replaced, as your leader, by dwight.
you might think that i am kidding, and i understand that.
because, dwight... never lies.
because that is all it takes.
ok, dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?
oh, I will be fine.
no, no, i do not, but-- i... will not.
i will not.
well, i guess it is time, that i turn over the keys, to the famous sebring.
it is a corporate lease dwight, you have earned it.
what?
but you said you liked it.
you have always admired it.
take it back.
that is my car.
that is my car.
i know, dwight.
i know.
i know.
i know.
jan called me about your little meeting!
i know, what you did.
i made the whole thing up, dwight.
oh do you?
do you like the sebring-- how dare you?!
how dare you, dwight?
give me one good reason why i should fire you right here on the spot?!
not.
good.
enough!
i have a laundry machine!
i do not know if i can trust you anymore.
you can get up.
get up.
and you can hug it out, bitch.
hug it out, bitch.
that is what men say to each other, after a fight.
they hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.
and walk away.
and they are done.
not a good idea to say that to a woman however.
i have found.
it does not translate.
yep.
yeah, we hugged it out.
but, it turns out, i was still a little angry.
so, i felt i needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and I am making him do my laundry for a year.
okay.
it is not your business, dwight.
what do you know about management, dwight?
I am not firing anyone.
... what?
okay.
here we go.
everybody, you know what?
it dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, let us get back in there.
come on.
movie monday!
come on, stanley let us go.
ryan?
okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so i guess i will just go play some online scrabble.
so, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the mcdreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he is in love with her... really?
hey ryan, can i get you a pencil from the warehouse?
oh, it is okay, I am going down.
all right, I will be right back.
there you go.
you are welcome.
do not mind if i do.
see you in a minute.
there you go, fresh from the warehouse.
there is coffee in the kitchen, pam.
all right.
okay.
i am like bette midler in for the boys.
got to keep the troops entertained.
all right.
oookay.
let me see if i have his cell.
is this the only reason you are calling, jan?
or does somebody miss me?
oh, wow.
attention, everybody.
i just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that i should know first.
my old boss ed truck has died.
yes, i am.
it is very sad.
because he was my boss.
that is right, you worked with him.
so did creed.
well, I will be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.
cheer me up.
so did you hear the news?
yeah.
oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?
it is... pssssh... .
he was almost 70.  circle of life.
yeah.
mmmmmm.
yeah.
must really have you thinkin'.
the older you get, the bigger the chance is you are going to die.
you knew that.
what?
oh my god.
that is just not the way a dunder mifflin manager should go, I am sorry.
alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
so, I am not exactly sure how to say this... what are you doing?
i did not... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.
and that is when his head was separated from the rest of him.
and i will let you know more as soon as i find out.
i do not understand.
we have a day honoring martin luther king, but he did not even work here.
you really do not get it, do you?
you do not understand these people.
that is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
a statue.
yeah.
well, i think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
we could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move... i think that is a great way to honor ed.
life-size.
well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, january mm hm.
oh do you?
you know who wished they could get back to work is ed truck.
but ed truck can not because he is-- dead.
that is perfect.
oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?
if it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.
probably get on pam.
what?
well, you know what?
i did not want to hear about it either, stanley, but i did and now i can not stop picturing it.
he leaves work, he is on his way home... wham!
his cappa is detated from his head!
well, you know what?
there is something wrong with you.
there is something wrong with everybody in here.
because we have lost a member of our family and you do not want to talk about it, you do not want to think about it, you just want to get back to work!
there are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
and right now, out there, they are all denying the fact that they are sad.
and that is   hard.
and it is making them all angry.
and it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.
and if not acceptance, then just depression.
if i can get them depressed, then I will have done my job.
i am going to throw you this ball.
when you catch the ball, i want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then i want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.
let me just start.
let me show you how this works.
i catch the ball.
i lost ed truck.
and... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I am crying, and nobody can hear me, because i am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
okay, fine.
hurry back.
okay, we can start.
um... yeah.
pam, you are a member of this family.
so we will wait for our family members.
phyllis, you want to give it a shot?
okay, why do not you throw the ball to somebody else.
oh, yes stanley.
come on.
your turn, you have to go.
okay... I am going to toss the ball to pam.
wow.
if you want to cry, that is okay.
do you want to talk about it anymore?
wait a second.
that is weekend at bernie's.
do you think that this is a game?
all right, we are starting over.
you are not leaving.
no!
we are not done.
yeah.
well, you know what?
the guy who had my job has died.
and nobody cares!
and he sat at my desk.
how do you know?
that that bird was dead?
did you check its breathing?
was its heart beating, toby?
did you check it?
no, of course you did not.
you are not a veterinarian.
you do not know anything!
oh, god!
oh my god!
oh my god, come on ... oh shhhh-oot!
no, he is not.
no, he is not.
well, you can not get diseases from a bird!
we do not know if it is dead.
attention everybody.
this will only take a second of your time.
today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
well, I am sorry to inconvenience you, meredith.
but that is what you do when things die.
you honor them.
toby killed this bird.
and now we are going to honor it.
no, no, no!
that is enough!
you know what?
this bird is dead.
he died alone.
the least you can do is be there for him now.
find a box for him.
it is okay.
it is okay.
shh... yes, i know, i know.
it is been a tough day, but it is good to let it show.
what are... what are you doing?
no, god, no it is not!
what is the matter with you?
is that the beak!?
glad you could all make it.
dwight, do you have the box?
you made this?
wow.
that is... that is very nice.
yes.
shhh.
society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong.
well, that is baloney, because grief is not wrong.
there is such a thing as good grief.
just ask charlie brown.
oh, wow.
he... does his family know?
but I am the first in the office?
okay, yes, sure, i will do that... ...because I am the first to to find out.
nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them.
well, good.
how are you holding up?
want me to come over?
ed truck died.
and it blows.
they say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because i found out before anybody so I have had more time to be sad.
i would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because i am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor.
we need to find out what is blocking you.
and that way, we will be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored.
may he rest in peace.
what was that, kevin?
no, you said something, did not you?
you think that is funny.
you are disgusting.
no, that can not be right.
well, then i guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, does not it?
you are ruining it, already.
they should not be given the choice.
wow.
wow.
no.
no.
you are the most heartless, soulless person I have ever met.
no.
no.
shh.
enough.
it is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here.
dwight, ryan, i want you to take the table out.
we are going to go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we are going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, i would like you to forget everything that toby has said, okay?
i do not think I am overstating it when i say that toby is a plague on this company.
and he is worthless.
you give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would.
grief counseling is not about, "are you hungry?
would you like a sandwich?" these people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.
okay, part of the problem was that toby talked at you.
now, i am going to talk with you.
first off, i want you to be comfortable, because you really can not grieve if you are all tight and buttoned up.
so, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want.
ladies, let your hair down.
you know what?
even take your shoes off.
i want to get personal and i want you all to really open up.
and i want you to know that anything and everything can be said.
i found an exercise in toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, "i do not want to do that.
i do not want to talk about that.
that is too private." here is how it works.
I am going to throw you this ball.
that is... hold it, hold it, hold it.
start, like, right in there.
just dig.
okay, give it to me.
you do not know what you are doing.
all right.
nothing.
let us just... all right.
guys, do you have a box we could use?
uhhh... nothing.
yeah, nothing.
how was your day?
wow.
well.
ok. i do not care how your day was either, january i was just asking you because you asked me.
why do you set me up like that?
i worked.
and then i went home to my condo.
and carol came over.
and then we had sex.
is that what you want to hear?
never ever, ever sleep with your boss.
i am so lucky that jan and i only got to second base.
hey koselli, the kos.
cosby.
hey hey hey.
i love jello pudding pops.
my son, theo, loves jello pudding pops too.
productivity is important but how can i be productive if i have this one little thing in my brain?
that i cannot get out.
and that one little thing is a soft pretzel.
so I am just going to have my soft pretzel, then I will get to work, and I will be super productive.
look out for me.
oh, shhh... come on.
uh huh.
hey, hey, hey!
phyllis, what are you doing?
no, i think you are cutting in line.
no, I am not going to settle down.
get in the back please.
boooooo.
thank you.
.
that is right.
no cuts.
oh, pam.
just the woman I would like to see.
you read my mind.
i thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while i go to the bathroom.
you are an angel.
because i like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
pam, productivity starts with patience and determination.
I will be back.
hi.
please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
thank god.
is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
all right!
thank you!
mr. kosseli.
hey hey hey, the cos. what is going on?
do we have a deal?
deal or no deal?
let us make a deal.
so what is the deal?
oh!
hey!
everyone, i am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation.
second... yes, second, toby.
second, i am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
and i will be taking questions.
carmel dip.
but, one question at a time please.
phyllis, stanley.
i want you to switch desks, I am going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything!
i think we are getting a lot done, do not you?
on paper at least.
and we are, after all, a paper company.
are we not, are we not, are we not?
are you with me, are you with me?
thank you very much!
hey, what time is it?
am or pm?
oh, good.
oh.
koselli.
with the jello.
yes.
right.
good.
goodnight!
well, that is really not the way i roll, because sometimes I am in the zone, and sometimes I am in the zoning out.
do you want me to go on amazon and order you a slang dictionary?
because I will do it.
yes, big if.
a woman spurned.
i always do.
if you lay a finger... would you look at that?
damn it, dwight!
come on.
"9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist.
met with jan, re: log.
lost log.
found log." "10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points." that is on the wrong page.
okay.
that sounds good.
yes.
actually, today's a good day to do that.
what makes them so good?
i mean, they are just dough twisted up with some candy.
they taste so good in my mouth.
nice dress, ryan.
ok. tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, kelly, has invited us all to a diwali celebration put on by her community.
what is diwali, you may ask?
well, to have kelly explain it  it is ada blah blah blah, it is so super fun and it is going to be great.
lot of gods with unpronounceable names.
twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a hindu halloween.
how come you did not get me one?
hey.
hey.
stop that.
that is offensive.
indians do not eat monkey brains.
and if they do... sign me up... because i am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
it is important that this company celebrates its diversity.
and you know what, stanley?
come kwanzaa time, i have got you covered, baby.
wha?
really?
you should!
it is fun.
i love the people here.
and if there was one thing i di... do not really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures.
and i do not want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, carol.
diwali is a very important holiday for the hindus.
but, frankly, I am a little appalled that none of you know very much about indian culture.
so, without further ado, kelly you are on.
kelly?
um... why do not you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
all right, all right, all right, all right.
this is not 'lord of the rings'.
now, a lot of people say that kelly is one in a million and that is true, but it is also not true.
because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like kelly in the world.
here are some famous indians.
subrahmanyan chandrasekhar.
he is a nobel prize-winning physicist.
impressive.
apu from the simpsons.
hilarious.
indian.
m. night shyamalan.
'the village', 'unbreakable', 'sixth sense', 'sig... ' okay.
spoiler... alert.
just stop it.
what is the... oh, whoa!
where did that come from?
and another thing about the indian people... they love sex positions.
i present to you the kama sutra.
i mean look at that.
who is seen that before?
thank you, kevin.
well, i find it beautiful.
no... no, you are not going to collect them.
no.
this is delightful, charming culture.
my indian culture seminar was going great until toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images.
it is just sex.
people... everybody does it.
I am doing it... with carol!
probably tonight.
what does that look like to you?
no one's even going to notice.
hey, kevin.
it is a costume.
why do not you just cool it, okay?
carol?
carol.
I will have one of those as well.
thank you very much.
now these are limes, lemons, onions... oh, yuck.
no.
these s'mores are disgusting.
do you think they have any s'mores?
all they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow.
how difficult would that have been?
wow, thirty years?
and you two only met once before the wedding night?
wow.
oh!
she is not a cheerleader.
she thought this was a costume party!
um... no, we are not married... yet!
she is.
very fair and very kind.
so... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire?
no?
okay.
it is still very cool.
ok. thanks!
I am going to be.
hi, I am just going to get this for a sec... just a sec.
um... everyone?
I am sorry, could i have your attention, please.
thank you.
ah-hah... hi.
sorry.
i just have an announcement to make.
um... okay.
i have learned a lot about indian culture tonight.
but i have learned even more about love.
and i know you are all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' well, I am not crazy.
maybe I am crazy in love.
so without further ado, carol?
carol stills.
i would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
what do you say?
i did not hear you.
oh, you have got to be kidding me.
okay.
no.
i get it.
i get it.
you are not ready.
we will wait.
this is a classic... yeah, well, but i ... i feel like I have known you many lifetimes.
maybe I am hindu after all.
okay, I am not hindu, but... carol.
carol, i just... i feel like... i just like you so much.
yes.
ok. okay.
good night.
hey, you know what?
why do not i come with you.
because I have got this book called the kama sutra.
all right.
good night.
oh, god!
oh.
wow.
that is so spicy.
oh.
you waiting for a call?
wow.
pam.
when carol said 'no.' tonight, i think i finally realized how you must be feeling.
we are both the victims of broken engagements.
i was in that marriage arena, though.
yeah.
uuuuh... well.
we are so alike.
so alike.
what are you doing?
I am... what?
i did not can i have a ride home?
these are not my shoes.
this is just like that show 'taxi cab confessions'.
sorry.
this is going out to indians everywhere.
it is a tribute to one of the greats... mr. adam sandler.
diwali is a festival of lights.
let me tell you something.
tonight has been one crazy night.
so put on your saris, it is time to celebrate diwali.
everybody looks so jolly.
but it is not christmas, it is diwali.
the goddess of destruction kali stopped by to celebrate diwali.
do not invite any zombies to a celebration of diwali.
along came polly to have some fun at diwali.
if you are indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy diwali.
happy diwali!
how do i explain this to jan?
oh, please, stop talking.
three words or less.
an indian halloween.
okay, great.
pam, could you put jan on, please?
hello, january well, i was letting everybody go to the big diwali party.
what is diwali?
you do not know what diwali is?
wow, january I am surprised.
it is the hindu festival of lights.
i just assumed you would be familiar with it.
it is the most sacred and honored hindu holiday in the world.
it is like christmas, easter, and halloween-- --rolled into one.
i bet you are not even aware that our own kelly kapoor, who works in... ... customer service is a hindu person.
and.
yeah.
you do?
oh, i dunno about that.
for kelly, that seems a bit much.
yeah, you should see her naked.
i had promised carol a romantic evening on the town.
um, i wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she is allergic to hay.
so i said, "pop a claritin, and i will spot you the seventy bucks," and she is like "i do not like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication."  and I am like, "well you are really not going to like what i slipped in your drink last night." and she is like, "what the hell are you talking about?" and I am like, "I am kidding.
i did not put a roof..."  ... we laughed so hard... it was hilarious... oh...  so yes, I am very excited about the diwali party.
and perhaps the most important person to indian culture, sir ben kingsley.
because of him, the british left india, and then he became an actor like ronald reagan.
yeah?
so, any questions?
there she is - jan levinson.
first... ...thing in the morning.
love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of january just call me levinson in the morning, baby.
yes.
i do not understand.
on whom's authority?
what?
you are welcome.
am i a small number person or a severance package person?
oh...  oh, my god.
oh, my god!
i do not really get it because we are not doing that bad and our numbers are going to come up.
well... oh, you got to be... josh?
oh really, what role is that?
king of the stupid universe?
it is an outrage, that is all.
it is... hey're making a huge, huge mistake.
let us see josh replace these people.
let us see josh find another stanley.
you think stanleys grow on trees?
well they do not.
there is no stanley tree.
do you think the world is crawling with phyllises?
show me that farm.
with phyllises and kevins sprouting up all over the place.
ripe for the plucking.
show me that farm.
pictures.
memories.
look at that.
they grow up so fast.
do not say that.
that just sounds weird.
please.
well... we have nothin to talk about, dwight.
just do your work ... while you still can.
yeah, great!
amazing.
best physical condition of my life.
nothing.
just checking in.
i can not tell you, so... nothing, pam.
what difference does it make?
we will be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
what?
do i have any messages?
ok, ok... listen up, everybody... i have some news.
we are screwed.
dunder-mifflin, scranton is being shut down.
you knew about this all along, did not you?
traitor.
you are a traitor.
i do not know.
probably not.
this is the worst.
darryl.
noble darryl.
i know, i know.
well, I will land on my feet.
do not worry about me.
so, you will be okay too.
you are a warrior.
you are smart, capable.
you will find something else and... awesome.
this is my house.
the cfo is taking away my house and giving it to josh.
and josh is giving the garage to bob vance.
all right, listen up.
some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing.
but, i am not going to take this lying down.
i have a plan and i am going to save our jobs.
so just hang in there.
let us go.
yes.
this might get ugly.
i need backup.
go to new york, confront the cfo, show him he is making a mistake... save the branch.
no... way.
no.
there is no one else.
okay, okay.
um... why?
you sent him cards?
you never met him.
okay, this is it.
this is exactly what michael moore does, famous documentarian.
he goes up to people with a camera and he is like "why did you do this?
why did you pollute?
you are bad.
you are a bad person." it is very dramatic.
although, i can not say i was a big fan of  'bowling for columbine', because i thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'kingpin'.
and it was not.
it was something else.
i will improvise.
i will speak from the heart.
all right.
yes, but these are employees, sir.
these are human beings.
stop... stop it!
just, okay.
he is not going to say any of that.
because he would be intimidated and i, just... let us start again.
just be more scared of me, okay?
do not touch me this time.
excuse me, mr. wallace?
the office.
no, not until i have some good news for them.
not until i have some good news.
anything?
what if this does not work?
what is the office actually goes under?
all right, favorite moments in dunder-mifflin history.
go.
that was hilarious.
the foam ... oh, right.
okay, that is enough.
that is good.
oh, hmm, all of them.
i loved them all.
every single one.
god, dwight!
what are we still doing here?
it is over.
let us go home.
get the car.
oh, this was such a stupid idea!
this was so stupid.
i am such a stupid idiot.
i let everybody down.
everybody hates me.
i lost everybody's jobs.
nobody likes me anymore!
what?!
we did it?
we did it.
right here!
right here!
yeah, baby!
we did it!
how did we do it?
i do not understand.
here... who is here?
yes, please.
karen filip...  ka-ren fili-pell-li.
okay.
my branch is absorbing the stamford branch.
or, as i like to put it, my family is doubling in size.
that is all I am going to say about it because i have a gigantic performance ahead of me.
and i have to get into my head and focus.
who is next?
andy bernard.
saint bernard.
what?
I am not... I am not firing somebody on the first day.
got the food?
good!
looky-looky-looky.
what i want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please.
make it look nice.
as if you are trying to impress a much older man who is way out of your league.
ah!
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.
our first arrival.
welcome to scranton.
this is hannah smoterich-barr.
welcome to our humble abode.
follow me to your desk.
your ball and chain is right over here.
you know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have.
so...  as far as I am concerned,  this says 'world's best dad'.
ah!
there he is tony... what is your last name?
gardner!
i knew that.
there you go.
gift bag... for you.
okay.
well, they are just for guests.
if there are any left over, you can buy one later.
wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around scranton.
all right!
let me show you to your area, sir.
come on, big guy.
welcome.
welcome, welcome, welcome!
take me to your leader.
oh wait, i am your leader.
mmm... dah.
i am actually your boss, michael scott.
welcome.
wow!
you are very exotic looking.
was your dad a g.i.
or uh?
ah!
you must be andy bernard.
aloha and welcome!
a-ha-ha-ho.
very good!
welcome to our little kingdom.
ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
oh.
they are nifty!
they are nifty gifties.
you know who i really like?
is this guy andy bernard.
he has got this very likable way about him.
no way.
get him out of here.
we do not want any of this kind in here.
good to see you, man.
how are you?
martin nash, i presume?
this is a little gift bag for you.
free of charge.
follow me, i will show you where all the slaves work.
not... so, your desk is... right.
i present the orientation video.
not now.
i told you the titles are irrelevant.
they just relate to pay scale.
it is not a matter of more or less.
your pay is just different.
okay?
all right!
show time, part one.
i do not care!
dwight!
you all report to me!
that is all that matters!
the rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
work it out amongst your selves!
please!
i have a company to run.
well, you let me run the company?
will you?
please?
okay.
everybody settled in?
good.
why do not we all proceed in to the conference room?
or, should i say, the banquet hall.
for... drum roll, please , the official merger day all-family welcome breakfast.
come on in!
yoko shack.
nope, no.
guests only.
nope.
um... for the guests it is.
for you, consider it cow-meat.
strictly taboo.
well, then... consider it poisoned beef.
no touchy.
no, it is not beef... just... sit down, please.
welcome.
help yourself.
wrong.
toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.
okay.
do not worry.
all of your questions are about to be answered.
cell phones and pagers off, please.
let us face it.
moving to a new job can be very stressful.
so i have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers.
but it is not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen.
it is funny.
it is got a little bit of a zing to it and i hope that it gives you a flavor of what we are all about here at dunder mifflin.
and what we are all about here in scranton.
so let us just all laugh together and watch "lazy scranton".
sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man dwight just to see what was shakin'.
so check out how we live they call it scranton.
the electric city.
scranton.
the electric city.
call poison control if you are bit by a spider.
i am so scared... when people do not label their personal food.
you like coal mines and you want to see  them, well, check it out, yo, the anthracite museum!
plenty of space in the parking lot, spot.
scranton.
what?
the electric city.
scranton.what?
the electric city.
scranton.
what?
well, so far, i think it is killin'.
i thought it would either be an 'a' or an 'a+' but i completely forgot that there is an 'a++'.
oh-kay.
sorry to interrupt.
i... all right.
okay.
what is that?
a squid's eye or... how did you... people hate people that are different from them.
that is natural.
but you know what makes people forget their differences?
a great show.
that is why i created the 'integration celebration'.
this is the moment when scranton and stamford come together as one.
united in applause.
i know what a lot of you must be thinking.
'wow!
what a day!
feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out.
a night... at... the roxbury.
okay.
there is supposed to be music and it is... i got it, i got it!
i got it.
dwight!
just.
ssshh stupid!
um... that is it!
yes, yes!
okay!
okay, here we go.
oh!
oh!
oh!
oh!
scuse me!
scuse me!
you me?
you me?
me you?
you!
you!
you me!
bow bow bow!
you me?
you me?
me you me!
you!
you!
you me you!
you!
oh my nose so itchy, why is my nose so itchy!
okay, i told you these guys had a sense of humor.
okay!
okay!
all right, all right, I am on a roll.
why are the new people on the table?
to show them that we are not above them.
not today.
no.
tony!
please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
i understand.
we are all friends.
oh, well.
just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
you know what?
I will help.
i will... do not be shy!
dwight!
let us do this!
come on.
we are doing this thing!
let us get up.
bend at the knees.
okay, here we go.
here we go.
I am under this... I am under this hock here.
i do not know what I am grabbing here.
we have almost got it.
push it!
push it!
I am right in your crack!
up and over.
up and over.
you have got it.
you have got it, you have got it.
whoa whoa whoa!
okay.
easy.
do not... what... i do not understand.
well, we will squeeze you in.
you can not quit!
on the first day.
that is  heresy, my friend!
okay, let us talk about this.
what happened?
i mean, what... was it toby?
did he say something?
because he is... what?
my management style?
so... did not you think 'lazy scranton' was funny?
okay.
well, do not bother quitting because you are fired.
you are fired!
I am sorry, but we do not have quitters on this team!
just clean out your desk!
do not try to apologize to me, man!
it is too late.
just get out!
take your bad vibes with you.
probably the best advice you ever gave me, dwight.
whoa, angela!
hold on.
hooters is a restaurant.
with over 400 locations worldwide.
no.
we do have to get along.
can not we all just get along?
or have we forgotten the words of the reverend king.
the word merger comes from the word marriage.
and that was what today was supposed to be.
the loving union between people.
instead, it has become like when my mom moved in with jeff.
and once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
hey!
hey, everybody!
something happened!
those guys from vance refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
yeah!
they punk'd us!
they punk'd us good!
come on.
come on!
man, they got us so bad.
we cannot let them get away with this.
we have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
yeah.
go home, toby.
just... why?
i will tell you why.
because they saved the worst for me.
they put a hate note under my windshield wiper.
check this out.
it is so hateful.
"you guys suck!
you can never pull together as one and revenge us.
that is why you suck!" no.
no, no, no.
no.
you are falling for it.
you are playing right into their hands.
this is just what they want you to do.
do not, oh... this is egregious!
this is egregious!
see that?
mission accomplished.
like a bunch of fourth graders.
sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady.
although that will change.
because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person i hung out with the most.
jell-of!
hi, jan!
i did.
major personnel crises averted.
compliment accepted.
yes.
but do you realize that that was actually dwight's idea?
bad advice from my number two.
what?
yes, i know that.
for, i do read the memos.
so after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, i have decided to make jim my new number two.
uh... that i have not decided yet.
thank you, andy.
that is... very kind.
thanks.
shut it... shut it!
that is...  suck up!
and this is, do not tell me, martin... ne... ne...nack.
martin nash.
okay.
good.
what are you talking about?
all right, just... smiles.
good, what is funny?
oh, nicknames, yay!
penguin power.
good.
hey, girls.
what is happening?
startinng to blend?
well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are going to share the same menstrual cycle.
can not we all get along?
no, we can not.
but here is the thing: yes, we can.
well, why not?
because of differeneces.
well, can we overcome these differences?
no.
can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences?
no, we can not.
but, we have to try and that is why i created the integration celebration.
i need somebody to pick a card.
one of the new people, please?
tony?
all right.
good.
thank you.
do not look at your card.
now, I have always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here .
so to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts.
turn over your card.
so i think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be  a king of hearts.
dwight, do not, do not be a suck up.
what i want all of you  to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them.
who wants to start?
who wants to give it a shot?
okay meredith, let us give it a shot.
beautiful.
very good, nice.
okay.
we heard it.
we heard what you said.
you did not cover it at all.
they are going to have... you can not say that, all right?
idiot.
dwight's an idiot!
did you catch that or did... did the cough cover it?
you are a jerk.
dwight's a jerk!
ohhh, wow.
look at that.
how cute.
ohh.
may i?
hey, look at me, I am a baby!
I am one of those babies from "look who is talking." what am i thinking?
look at all those staplers!
what is a stapler!?
i do not even know, I am a baby!
hey, mom, I am thirsty!
I am thirsty, mama!
i want some milk.
and you know where milk comes from!
breasts.
yeah, jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort.
receipt.
i do not know.
i did not hire an ex-convict.
unless they mean toby.
convicted rapist.
... I am just kidding.
hey jan, speaking of stamford, hannah brought in her baby.
hannah?
kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
because you think he is black.
stop it.
stop it right-stop it right now.
why did the convict have to be a black guy?
it is such a stereotype.
i just wish that josh had made a more progressive choice.
like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.
in our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything.
he was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole martin in prison thing.
people will draw unfair conclusions about martin and or black people.
good.
all right.
just... try to be cool.
okay, are you cool, really?
um... martin, from stamford, was, at one time, in prison.
no.
dwight!
be cool!
be cool!
hey martin, how is it going?
ah.
good good.
good.
just a second.
everybody?
may i have your attention please?
i realize that a lot of you have already heard that martin here has had some trouble with the law, but i just want to declare publicly that i... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who does not is an ignorant, dumb... person.
okay?
as a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and i will show you a black man that i trust even more.
pam.
tell me a white person you trust.
...danny glover.
yeah.
who?
oh.
please.
colin powell.
yup.
apollo creed.
close your eyes.
picture a convict.
what is he wearing?
nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, that is shizzle.' okay.
now slowly open your eyes again.
who are you picturing?
a black man?
wrong.
that was a white woman.
surprised?
well, shame on you.
no.
that is not cool.
you do not have to tell them.
that is awesome.
well, we are running a business, so.
ah.
well.
that is not true.
no you would not.
this place is not prison.
it is... way better than prison.
okay!
listen up everybody!
um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and i heard ya, loud and clear, so, i am instituting some changes to make this more like prison.
we are going to start with an hour of outdoor time.
so let us go!
why do not we... pump some iron?
anyone want to... pump up?
it is uh... two and a half.
I am not going for bulk, I am going for tone.
yeah, it is... freaking cold out here.
anybody wants to stay out, you have got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
oh heyyy.
martiiin.
you have tv in the joint?
ah.
a ten inch black and white?
these people do not realize how lucky they are.
this office is the american dream.
and they would rather be in the hole.
all right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today.
corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here.
and none of can say "boo" because none of us have ever been to prison.
well, there is somebody I would like you to meet.
somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like .
I am prison mike!
you know why they call me prison mike?!
do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!
all right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that is just the way we talk in the clink.
been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but i am here to scare you straight.
i am here to scare you straiiight!!
in prison you are somebody is bitch.
oh, and you.
you, my friend, would be da belle of da ball.
do not drop the soap!
do not drop the soap!
internet.
and prison.
eh, fifty-fifty, both.
look, prison stinks, is what I am saying.
it is not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
i stole.
... and i robbed.
and i kidnapped... the... president's son.
and held him for ransom.
and i nevah got caught, neither.
gruel.
sandwiches.
gruel omelettes.
nothing but gruel.
plus, you can eat your own hair.
yeah.
yeah.
well, thank you, andy.
tanks.
the worst thing about prison was the... was the dementors.
they... were flying all over the place, and they were scary.
and they would come down, and they would suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
no, not harry potter.
... there are no movies in prison.
this is my point!
you guys got it soft, and cushy!
this place is freaking awesome!
the people are awesome!
your boss is nice!
everyone seems to get along!
people are tolerant!
people who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves!
nobody is nobody's bitch.
i hope that this scared you.
and from me, prison mike, to you, i just want to thank you for listening to me.
letting me be a part of your life today.
because you got a good life!
you got a good life.
a good life.
so.
what do you think?
it does not sound so great, does it?
okay.
okay, fine.
you guys think prison is so great?
all right.
well, here you go.
no!
if you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison!
they are such babies.
i am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it is like to have freedom.
and if this does not bother them, then i am out of ideas.
they were very disrespectful to me, and to the office.
and martin has had a bad influence, to think that i gave him the benefit of the doubt.
okay.
you know what toby?
i am teaching them a lesson, so.
okay nutcases, get out of there!
good work.
long day.
really long.
why do not you guys head home.
early.
time off for good behavior!
heh.
good job.
enjoy your freedoms!
martin went from being a new guy from stamford... to a convict, to... my friend.
back to a convict.
then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest.
and finally, to... a quitter.
and i will not miss him.
and that is not because he is black.
deck the halls with boughs of holly.
fa la la la la la la la la.
it is the ... ack.
hey!
i would like a nice slice of christmas pam.
side of candied pams.
and perhaps, some pam-chops, with mint... I am looking for the toy drive box.
ok...  well, i need to put this bike in there.
i hope it will fit, with all these little knickknacks.
umm... i do not know?
average kind?
well, that is probably from the test drive.
no.
oh, thanks.
yes?
oh pam, that is so sweet.
you did not have to do that.
ok. did everybody get one of these?
terrific.
good.
this is going to be the best christmas ever.
my girlfriend carol is coming to our party tonight, and i have a little surprise for her.
I have got two tickets to paradise!
pack your bags, we are leaving the day-after-tomorrow!
um,  taking her to sandals, jamaica, all-inclusive.
all-inclusive.
you know what that means?
right?
yeah.
there she is.
a christmas carol.
hello  you are about five hours early to the party.
you are such a blonde.
hey, everybody.
i do not know who you have not met yet, but i think this is one of them.
this is my girlfriend - carol.
this is just the front of her.
show  them, show  them the other side.
turn around, turn around.
come on.
no, you get outta here.
yes.
thank you.
not as much as i need a moment alone with you.
berp.
that is my christmas card.
it is a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast.
ski-sons greetings.
i know.
right.
yes, but what you did not realize at the time was that i was with you in a sense.
i was in your heart... and next to your kids.
what?
i do not understand?
ok no, no no no ok, ok, you know what, you are not thinking straight.
you know what you need?
you need to think this through in  jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
i got us tickets to sandals, jamaica, we leave day after tomorrow.
.
you better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
and it is all inclusive.
yes.
no, carol.
you walk out that door and it is over.
I would like everybody's attention.
christmas is canceled.
keep it up stanley and you will lose new year's.
jim, take new year's away from stanley.
carol and i split up.
amicably.
and i just do not think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
fine!
have your party.
just no guests.
well, you know what phyllis?
all of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
it hurts my heart.
it hurts my stomach.
it hurts my arms.
thanks.
how did you push away the bad thoughts?
like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
and not that you did not want to try them.
some wine may have helped.
do you know what I am referring to?
take it from toby.
hey, would you like to go to sandals, jamaica with me?
it is all...  ok. what are you doing?
carol?
i do not have to buy it.
i just want to taste it.
i just... i just want a little taste of it.
goodbye my lover.
goodbye my friend.
this is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours.
with carol, i knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day i met her.
all right.
nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
hooters?
ah, i need my entourage  jim.
dwight.
ryan.
c'mon, we are going to asian hooters.
why not?
ok, feel better.
c'mon jim, let us go.
bros before hos.
why?
because your bros are always there for you.
they have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason.
and you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you.
and that she was better than all the other hos in the world.
and then ... and then suddenly she is not yo' ho no mo'.
dwight, just, just leave them alone please.
they are on a date.
they look very happy.
carol used to drink lattes.
she would get this little foam mustache... and i used to say "hey, got latte?" and she would say, that is not funny.
she totally got me.
she understood that we did not have to laugh to enjoy -- I am already starting to forget what color eyes she had.
i can not, ok, I am going to call her.
i am going to call and find out... I am just going to call her.
nothing he is doing is cheering me up.
oh, sure you would.
look at you, i bet you break up with a guy every hour.
you are right.
that is good.
i do not know.
no one can hear me.
you know what?
start the party.
ahh, damn this chicken is good.
my compliments to the chef.
which is you!
right?
hahahaha.
awesome!
i need some meat.
i want some steak.
i see steak.
excuse me  ah, un guard.
family style.
i do not think... i love it!
i do not know what he is doing.
you know what we should do?
we should invite them to the christmas party.
oh, you are such mench my friend.
ok, where is everybody?
i would like them to meet my new girlfriend.
the least i could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
nah, you rock.
tell you what, if you want it, it is yours.
oh.
that is what she said.
hello?
i would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
the giant baby.
wow, i am so sorry, i had no idea this party would be so lame.
oh, party in the break room!
let us go, let us go!
thank god!
let us go to the break room.
shhh... shut it!
c'mon!
party.
we are going to ... i just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world.
people who own houses and people who own condos.
and... my question to you  is do you agree?
do you agree about what?
wow.
you are  lucky you are so darn cute.
what are you talking about?
when you know, you just know.
check her out.
my little gal over there.
babe-alectable.
it is... it is one of those two.
yeah... well, it is been hard, they are wearing the exact same uniform.
and I have been drinking.
and you know how all waitresses look alike.
i honestly do not see what the big deal is.
stevie wonder is married.
are you going to tell me that stevie wonder does not love his wife just because he is not sure what she looks like?
hey.
where is my girl?
is she in the fridge?
where is she hiding?
i do not know where she is.
because I am drunk, i can not even find her.
haha, i do!
i just have not hugged you in awhile oh, good.
that felt good.
let us go.
party.
hey, hey, you.
how are ya?
no, no, no.
hey, you should stay because we are having fun and... where do you want to go?
i... you know what?
i, ok, listen.
i like you.
i really like you.
so much in fact, that i would like you to accompany me on a trip to sandals, jamaica.
you want help?
ok... merry christmas.
that waitress was the one.
how can you be sure?
do not make fun... you are making fun of me.
i guess, i did not know her very well.
i marked her arm.
i, i put a mark on her arm.
so i could tell them apart.
i do not... i know, i know.
i can not believe i gave her my bike!
oh, why do i feel like crap?
i had rebound?
yeah.
i totally rebounded.
someone else shoots and i take the ball and i score.
well, i guess i did not score and I am not sure who is actually shooting, but, whatever.
does not matter.
it is all good.
or as my ex might say.
domo arigato, mr. scott-of.
yes, i just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to jamaica with me.
there is this resort called sandals.
really?
ok. all right.
i promise you will not be disappointed.
umm, it is all-inclusive... william randolph shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I am paraphrasing here, "love doth be poison." brilliant.
and a lot of people do not give shakespeare enough credit.
they think it was somebody else.
a-holes.
no, no, no, no.
you know what, i better hold off.
i want to make sure i do not dial carol before i get drunk.
yeah.
you know what?
i am.
I am going to call her.
that is a good idea.
no, i do not think I am asking too much.
i think it is only fair that you tell me exactly what i did wrong.
okay.
uh huh.
well that... yeah.
uh huh.
all right.
well, could you tell me something that i did <i>right</i>?
oh, honey, here is stanley.
he is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.
sounds good.
okay, let us go.
hey, mon!
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
relax.
just relax, ok?
I will get to all of it later.
are not you going to ask me how jamaica was?
say it.
ask me.
it was <i>so</i> good.
oh, hey mon!
at sandals, jamaica, when somebody says "hey mon," everybody says "hey mon" back.
stanley.
you know what?
it is really good to see you, too.
ok, well payroll is in charge of all that.
well, i am just getting settled in.
so, I am going to... you are not as much fun as your jamaican brothers... mon.
feelin' hot, hot, hot!
feelin' hot, hot, hot!
feelin' hot, hot, hot!
feelin' hot, hot, hot!
that is all i know so far, but I am going to keep practicing.
you know, i had never been out of the country before now?
got to see how jamaicans live.
it is great, you know.
they just relax, they party all the time.
yeah... gosh.
great.
you know what, pam?
make a note.
i want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
inventory's at the end of december.
i specifically went on vacation so i would miss it.
inventory is boring.
in the islands, they do not make you do stuff like take inventory.
why do you think so many businesses move to the caymans?
tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau.
i want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the dunder mifflin warehouse inventory.
so, party planning committee, get on it.
the jamaicans do not have a word for "impossible." how hard is a luau?
all you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers.
that is all you need.
come on in.
settle in.
settling.
settling... and settled.
good, there is something i would like to show everybody.
see this sign?
"no shirt, no shoes, no problem." this is an attitude i would like all of you to have right here.
so what, if we have to stay late to do inventory?
no problem.
no, no, no.
no, that is a german woman named urkel grue.
jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble.
so officially, i did not see her.
but i did see jan there.
in our room.
at night.
and in the morning.
that is all I am going to say.
sex.
we had sex.
i had sex with her.
i had sex with january hey dude.
i just got back from jamaica.
yeah, that sounds amazing.
you know what?
the lady jan levinson wanted to go to montego bay.
well I am looking at a photo, right now.
and I am telling 'ya, could be in maxim.
oh no?
ok. well, check this out.
i am sending you some email.
you got it?
check it again.
hit refresh.
ok, wait a second.
i sent it to you at...  <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="84d4e5e7efe1f6c4c0f1eae0e1f6c9ede2e2e8edeaaae7ebe9aa" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection"></a> <i>packaging</i>@dundermifflin.com.
uh oh.
darryl?!
hey.
hi.
where is darryl?
ok, hey, man, how is it going?
that is great, ok. um, so did you get an email from me?
ok. well, that was supposed to go to packer, not "packaging." did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
ok. um, well, did you get the second email that i sent?
explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
and you sent that out to everyone?
i have a special assignment for you.
a sensitive email has been released to the office.
it contains a file, a picture.
the file name is "jamaican jan sun princess." not important.
ok, forget it.
not now, not ever.
aww, none of your business.
that photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then i am going to call the cops.
this is probably the icebreaker you need.
i bet you would love all the details, would not you?
skeevy little perv.
no, no, no.
i am not dating january she was very clear about that.
just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth.
got enough, weirdo?
ok. oh, god, no.
no, no!
hang up!
hang up!
tell her I am not here.
tell... tell her, i ran out for cash.
i hit a deer.
i hit a deer with my car.
tell her i hit a cat.
tell her i hit a cat.
she bought it?
ok. ok. there an accident?
somebody hurt?
oh.
god.
no, no, no, no, no.
all right.
hello.
hi.
attention everyone.
um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very pg-13 rating picture of me and a woman-- no, kevin.
a woman.
maybe jan, maybe... my point is that, if you get it, i would ask that you just delete it.
sight unseen.
let us be professional, all right?
feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot!
hey.
island living.
you know?
did she say what it is about?
there are copies in the bathroom?
all right.
guh.
ok, yup.
i... i... i... yes.
ok, yeah.
who is dr. perry?
i... and i, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
so, umm... thanks for coming by.
so, i, uh... well thanks for coming over, i appreciate - jan, you... complete... me.
i just had the best, most romantic week of my life in sandals, jamaica.
went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive.
and then i flew back to scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.
hey, mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, brunch!
so delicious.
dinner, too.
and every morning i would watch the sunrise and i would eat a mango.
that is how i want to feel all the time.
it is called island living.
you know, how they say take a chill pill?
in jamaica, i took one.
guy on the beach sold it to me for $40.
and after i finished vomiting, i was more relaxed than i ever have been.
lost six pounds, too.
that is how i want every day to be.
yeah, mon.
me just got back to the office.
me had an i-rey time.
dwight, please, please.
i just got back from vacation, mon, all right?
so chill.
let us do not... do not harsh my mellow, mon.
presents.
i got presents for everybody.
dwight, a genuine rastafarian wig.
andy, i got you a genuine jamaican t-shirt.
they love milli vanilli down there.
you are so welcome, mon.
angela, you just got leied.
yes, you did.
okay.
oh, pam, i forgot to get you something.
I am just kidding.
coconuts for your coconuts!
try it on.
go ahead.
let me know if i miscalculated the size.
i do not think i did.
stanley, i got you some ganja.
I am just kidding.
it is coffee.
i bet you wish it was ganja.
i just got back from vacay.
come on.
give me a break, man.
waves over jamaica, $6.99.
okay, let me tell you a little story.
when i was on vacation, i met a man named bavon.
and bavon takes people parasailing.
and you know what he said to me?
he said that he loves going to work every day.
how many of you can say that you love going to work every day like bavon?
no one.
his name is bavon.
and you know what?
I am sure bavon gets sick of his job, too.
I am sure he would like to take a day off.
I am sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude.
and that is something that you learn when you go to jamaica, and you really apply yourself.
i would love to take them all to jamaica, but is that good management?
yes.
but is it the best management?
well, i can not afford it, and corporate will not pay for it.
so who is the real criminal?
how many of you know the meaning of the jamaican term, hakuna matata?
i... oh, that is red eye.
well... hey, can we just focus?
okay.
well, jan's email password is not dunder mifflin, sandals, jamaica, michael, michael scott, jan scott, or mrs. jan scott.
her passwords are not going to be dwight, dwight.
that is stupid.
okay.
do not you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that is able to eat up that other emails?
i read about something like that.
well, i am in america and i am online, so i do think it involves you.
uh-huh.
and if i were a subscriber, would then you be able to send out the gobbler?
I would... yes, i will hold.
hey!
hey!
stop your mouth, please.
hey, stanley, in case i do not see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash.
keep the change.
it is jamaican.
the exchange rate is 65-to-1.
i do not remember in which direction.
yes, good luck with that.
jim, could you come in here please?
sorry, oh wow, that is so rude.
I am sorry, i can not control him.
you know what?
get pam.
pam.
oh, that is gross.
damn it.
dwight, care to join us, finally?
thank you.
yes.
ok, here is the dream team.
my sales dream team.
today we are going to team up for sales calls.
andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
oh.
well, i appreciate that.
that is very gracious of you.
well, thank you sir.
ok, now going by seniority.
phyllis, our resident senior.
good.
next up, superfly himself, stanley.
you can not pass.
you have got to pick somebody.
so that just leaves dwight and jim.
dwight?
here ya go.
please.
long story.
all right everybody, circle up.
here we go.
you know what this is?
this is the "amazing race."  and you guys are the retired marines.
and you guys are the mother and daughter.
and you guys are the gay couple.
and we are the firefighter heroes.
are we ready to go?
no, we are just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
just bragging rights.
it is just... brrrrrr... it is "amazing race," phyllis.
okay?
we are in teams of two and we are on a mission.
all right, so, on your mark, get set, go.
let us do it.
whoah, whoah.
oh hahahaha.
vamanos!
here we go.
ugh... that is a long story.
um, couple of months ago, dwight tried to go behind my back with jan and get my job and i am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
hawkman.
let us go.
the men's room was disgusting.
hey, did you catch that up at lake wallenpaupack?
you know, i used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and i never caught anything that big.
you know what?
let us get right down to it.
dunder-mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
i think what andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
no.
stop it.
stop it.
yes.
ah, no.
do not worry about it.
what?
i do not know.
who knows how words are formed.
yes, andy.
he did not say.
no, you are remembering it wrong.
dwight betrayed me once before.
so this is his strike two.
you know what they say?
fool me once, strike one.
but fool me twice, strike three.
i knew it.
where were you this morning?
why do you lie, liar?
you are lying right now.
i know that you went to corporate this morning, and i know that you lied about it.
and given our history, i need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
ok, you know what?
i want you to think about your future in this company.
i want you to think about it long and hard.
do not.
do not you dare.
i want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
good luck.
yes, dwight schrute has left this company.
more personnel turnover.
yes, well.
it is a big loss.
dwight was the top salesman... i said 'was'.
what does that even mean?
that is impossible.
but, there is some good news.
oscar is back.
addition by addition.
so we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
hey, what is up.
yep.
i do not know.
maybe.
bathroom.
wow.
what is wrong with this thing?
it looks terrible.
yeah.
and you know what?
ask them about the toys on my desk too.
they always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way.
it used to brighten my morning.
really?
that was very nice of him.
we need more attitude like that around the office.
yeah, do you?
what did i say?
huh.
oh, no.
love that andy, right?
solid fellow.
seems smart enough.
likes me a lot.
a lot.
too much.
like a crazy person.
a little.
not super crazy... just... there is something about him that creeps me out.
i can not really explain it.
he is always up in my bidness.
which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." i do not understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.
no, hey, hey.
do not be ridiculous.
of course we are going to have a party.
a celebration of oscar.
oscar night.
and i want it to be oscar-specific.
no, no, no.
i mean, not because you are gay.
your gayness does not define you.
your mexican-ness is what defines you to me.
and i think we should celebrate oscar's mexicanity.
so phyllis... i want you to go find firecrackers.
and a chihuahua.
pam, in the frozen food section, swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
ah, a burro, of course.
if oscar wants a donkey, let us get him one.
who is that sportscaster that bit that lady?
marv something?
andy is like marv something.
great sportscaster.
big weirdo creep.
hey guys.
how is the workload on all of dwight's old accounts?
handling it okay?
yes, he did.
have any of you talked to dwight?
really?
do not - do not do that.
that is not nice.
what about you, phyllis?
you and dwight were close.
nice to have oscar back.
why would dwight do that for you?
i think i know why.
because dwight loves this company.
do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
pam, i have a mission to accomplish.
make sure this party gets rolling and i will be back shortly.
um.
no.
i do not want to do any of that.
no, just stop.
stop.
stop doing it.
you are going to drive me crazy.
hey.
what is up?
um.
it takes a big man to admit his mistake.
and i am that big man.
angela from accounting told me what you did.
yes, she did.
and dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly i have misjudged you from the beginning, and i apologize.
how is this place treating you?
oh, well.
no.
I am sure.
so, maybe you should come back.
you should come back.
please.
we can talk about that.
all right.
ladies and gentlemen!
may i present... mr. dwight schrute!
okay, dwight, you can let go of her hand.
you are going to break it.
not bad, huh?
guilty.
pam.
i will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
so does this remind you of your childhood right now?
wow.
thank you.
wow, that is- thanks so much.
and now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale!
sir, would you do the honor?
it takes a big man to admit his mistake and that is what i did.
the important thing is i learned something.
i do not want somebody sucking up to me because they think I am going to help their career.
i want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me.
hmm.
hello son.
if you are watching this, that means I am already dead.
life is a road-- how, would you stop interrupting please?
yesterday i was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and i gave myself the nastiest shock.
and when i came to, i had an epiphery.
life is precious.
and if i die i want my son to know the dealio.
the dealio of life.
here are some things that i want to teach you that your mother will not be able to.
to jump start a car, first pop the hood.
then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.
then you take these and clip them wherever.
number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra.
we will demonstrate on pam.
come on.
you just twist your hand until something breaks.
well you get the picture.
thanks pam.
and remember no matter what, i will always love you.
he is not going to be a murderer.
you know what, dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
okay.
from the top.
ready?
three- hello everyone!
as you know, we are six days away from phyllis' wedding.
so get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.
and karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you do not already have one.
this may be phyllis' only wedding ever.
it is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.
so i am instituting prima nocta.
I am sorry.
i had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
I am trying to get everyone excited about phyllis' wedding because i want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.
which will not be hard, because it is going to be awesome.
a lot better than hers, that is for sure.
it will probably be on a boat.
what is up spinsters?
no problem.
the guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.
from 2:30 to 3:15.  it is the only time that bob was available.
sort of a guy's night out.
a g-n-of if you will.
a gah-no.
actually, it is more of a guy's afternoon in.
a g-a-i.
a gay.
not- not- it is uh, not gay, it is just a, it is a bridal shower for guys.
a guy shower.
an hour long shower with guys.
yes.
yes!
oh!
there-oh!
oh god- no, no, no!
i can not believe you are not going to be there.
it is going to be good, it is going to be a great bachelor party man.
you should get out of them.
it is the only time he can do it.
2:30 to 3:15.  it is going to be great.
we are going to be doing some darts, we are going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.
going to be very delicious.
i did not order a stripper.
um, not personally, no.
i can not get a stripper here.
sexual harassment.
so that is what that means.
okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay.
uh!
gay.
okay.
co-ed naked strippers in this office.
for realsies.
okay.
we are off.
ryan and i are going to go get some supplies and i need you to handle hiring the strippers.
well get on it.
and make it happen.
gotcha, oh!
yes?
I am in the, I am in the sex shop.
squarepants?
and you think that would be sexy?
oh.
oh.
hello!
you wearing a thong?
hello ladies.
who here is a history buff?
who is a fan of buff naked?
without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy mr. benjamin franklin.
half pants, right mr. franklin?
he is in his knickers.
mr. franklin, i would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
yes, but, ben franklin was.
and when they came over on the mayflower.
bow chicka bow.
yeah, alright, so i want you to give him your undivided attention and mr. franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave i give you permission to spank them.
especially that one.
look at that.
nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
no.
yes.
but i got all the foot off of it.
guys, beef!
it is what is for dinner!
who wants some man meat?
well then my man meat, he shall have.
there you go.
deliciousity.
i call shuffle.
here we go.
ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.
everybody I would like to introduce you to elizabeth.
nice outfit.
he is right there.
there he is.
okay.
alright, I will do it.
yeah.
let us do it.
let us do this thing.
yeah.
what do i?
alright.
okay.
here we go.
alright!
not bad!
not bad!
you smell nice.
like tide.
you smell like tide detergent.
do you use tide detergent?
ha ha ha!
i have a girlfriend so... yeah she probably, yeah she would be.
you know what, okay, excuse me.
please stop it, stop it.
turn off the music.
this is wrong, this is wrong!
this is wrong!
i have a girlfriend.
and you are engaged and I am sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so let us just clear out okay.
shame on you.
go back to work!
on one hand i want to be honest with jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I am afraid she is going to dump me.
really.
well, ben franklin, you are really kind of a sleezebag.
stripper?
could i ask you a question about women?
um, should i tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
wow.
thank you.
not really, look i do not know how to say this so i just will.
i went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
no, today at work.
yes.
i kind of arranged it.
so you do not want to end our relationship?
that is so sweet.
you are the best gd girlfriend in the world.
do you know that?
you are.
you are.
so you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?
ben franklin.
and elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.
which rhymed.
really makes you wonder how ben franklin can become president, but someone like elizabeth can not.
always the bridesmaids, right ladies?
phyllis is getting married.
and i am in the wedding party.
she has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle.
so, basically, i am co-giving away the bride.
since i pay her salary it is like I am paying for the wedding.
which I am happy to do.
it is a big day for phyllis.
but it is an even bigger day for me.
employer of the bride.
there she is.
i swear phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at dunder mifflin.
how you doing?
you excited.
me, too.
if you need to vomit, that is ok. i did.
do you want to talk about tonight?
you are probably worried about pleasing bob.
a lot of pressure.
phyllis, did you break wind?
it is okay, if you did.
it is a very natural reaction.
it is your wedding.
and you are nervous... okay... umm... I am sure that bob... wow.
that is... that is pungent.
i lost my train of thought.
aaah... are you set on that hairstyle?
here, let me... just cover up that bald patch.
okay.
you might be surprised to learn that I have only been to one other wedding.
it is actually a very cute story.
my mom was marrying jeff.
and they asked me to be ring bearer.
i was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
i hate you!
long story short: jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer.
and the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.
this strappy young lad sitting here is phyllis' father, albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, are not you albert, hah?
ah, ringbearer.
i could have done better.
i will do better.
i am going to be better.
i can not believe I am actually doing this!
ooh!
are you ready for this, albert?
i am.
let us do it.
that is ok. this is bull****!
me walking phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding.
and now... the wedding has no highlight.
i can not believe i pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show.
that is... well... i got news for you, albert.
if that is your real name.
the show's not over.
ladies and gentlemen, may i present to you for the first time as a couple, mr. and mrs. bob vance!
oh, shiii... ladies and gentleman, for the first time as a couple, mr. and mrs. bob vance.
yeah!
that is what I am talking about!
congratulations, bob.
you are a good man.
but just know... if you ever lay a finger on phyllis, i will kill you.
agreed.
no fingers will be laid on phyllis.
oh, decided to sit down again, huh?
great.
bet you can hear me, too.
phyllis!
are you happy with everything?
what can i do to make it more perfecter?
I am already on it.
the chicken?
totally undercooked.
i sent it back.
i will take care of that.
i do.
i know a fair amount about fine food... and drink.
this is a white.
thank you, randy.
that was great.
thank you.
thank you very much.
hi, I am michael scott and for the next forty minutes, I am going to be your tour guide through the lives of phyllis lapin and bob vance.
one of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time.
my name is michael scott.
webster's dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch.
well, you know something.
i think you guys are two metals.
gold medals.
for those of you who do not know me, I am michael scott, phyllis' boss.
to quote from the princess bride "mawige... the most important part of a speech is the opening line.
when time is not a factor, i like to try out three or four different ones.
phyllis and bob: their celebrity couple name would be phlob.
you look at her... and she is kind of matronly today, but back in high school, i swear, her nickname was 'easy rider'.
now as for bob... bob vance... is a guy that... he works... okay hold, hold on, hold on.
look.
look.
i did not say anything when phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony.
and i think you owe me this.
kay.
no.
I am not going to... ok. all right.
oh.
yeah.
you are out of here!
you are... yeah.
i hate you!
come... come on!
dwight, just... look, i just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake.
I am not even going to dance one song.
ok. ee... i was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
i just want phyllis to have a great day.
we are great together.
we are a great team.
yes.
yes.
they were.
robert parrish!
i should talk to her.
i do not want this to ruin her honeymoon.
dude, keep it together.
i listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
phyllis.
phyllis!
wait!
please.
I am sorry.
i just... i just wanted to make this a day to remember.
yeah.
yeah.
he is kind of a weirdo.
you are... you are welcome.
they say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake.
i say that is crazy.
i say let them eat cake.
margaret thatcher said that about marriage.
smart broad.
be careful.
oh no!!
oh wow!
phyllis!
phyllis!
you look like a clown!
here.
get me!
get me!
oh hey, kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
huh?
pop quiz.
why is today a special day?
today's a special day, because i am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you... in business school, kevin.
business school.
a boss is like a teacher.
and i am like the cool teacher.
like mr. handell.
mr. handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes.
and he actually hooked up with one of the students.
um... and then like twelve other kids came forward.
it was in all the papers.
... really ruined eighth grade for us.
here we go.
college roadshow.
got to bring our... a game.
what was the most inspiring thing I have ever said to you?
will they throw their hats, you think?
a lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
yeah, i know, i know.
I am just saying if they did throw their hats I have got a great line for that: "may your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... that was a pretty good line.
i understand!
wow.
relax, spazzy boy.
sometimes you are such a little spaz!
whoa, hey!
we have fun.
campus.
brings back so many memories.
... that i would have made.
hey.
frisbee.
check that out.
aww!
what do you say we get our fris on before class?
whoo!
okay, this is it.
ryan is doing my intro right now.
i can not hear what he is saying, but he looks like he is really into it.
hello everyone, i am michael scott.
and i would like to start today by inspiring you.
may i borrow someone is textbook, please?
thank you.
what have we here?
ooh.
economics.
very, very interesting.
you cannot learn from books.
replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold.
i know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless.
good.
alright.
i think you are inspired.
shall we proceed?
there are four kinds of business: tourism.
food service.
railroads, and sales.
and hospitals slash manufacturing.
and air travel.
so, you want to start a business.
how do you start?
what do you need?
well, first of all, you need a building.
and secondly, you need supply.
you need something to sell.
now this could be anything.
it could be... a... thingamajig.
or a... a whosi-whatsi.
or...  a whatchamacallit .
now, you need to sell those in order to have a payday .
and, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 grand .
satisfied?
okay, I am seeing some confused... faces out there.
let me slow down a little bit.
break this down.
okay.
the more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy playstations and beanie babies.
...and products!
well... okay, i was just kind of getting it going.
um, alright.
well, okay, we can do questions.
okay.
very good.
first hand up.
we can not overestimate the value of computers.
yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails.
but real business is done on paper, okay?
write that down.
...i say you will miss our service, and i absolutely guarantee you will come back.
...we do not want them back, because they are... stupid.
nice try, how is your pollack-says-what index?
thanks, kowalsky.
um, can we get on track here?
...wait, ryan said that?
yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower.
and your ebony tower.
you know what?
tell you one thing, dunder-mifflin is here to stay.
david will always beat goliath.
yeah, yeah.
you know what else is facing five goliaths?
america.
al-qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning.
so do we just give up?
is that what we are learning in business school?
dunder-mifflin is the big picture!
can not you understand that?
no, you can not.
you are too young.
ryan... has never made a sale.
and he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita.
and everybody thinks he is a tease.
well you know what?
he does not know anything, and neither do you.
so suck on that!
business is always personal.
it is the most personal thing in the world.
when we get back to the office, pack your things.
you heard me, pack your things.
fire you?
no, no no.
you are moving... to the annex.
a good manager does not fire people.
he hires people and inspires people.
... people, ryan.
and people will never go out of business.
pam-casso!
sorry I am late, i had to race across town.
wow!
you did these... freehand?
my god, these could be tracings!
ohh!
look at this one.
wow!
you nailed it.
... how much?
i do not see a... price.
well, yeah.
yeah, we have to have it for the office.
i mean, there is my... window, and there is my car!
that your car?
that is our building... and we sell paper.
... i am really proud of you.
what?
...chunky.
do you want half?
okay.
it is... a message.
it is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty.
and without paper, it could not have happened.
unless, you had a camera.
well ultimately i went into business to inspire people.
they say those who can not do, teach.
i can do both.
i teach doing.
wow!
that is a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.
so no?
oh, umm, ever since i started here, I have kept a diary of all my sales.
no, it is just mileage mostly, but there is one chapter that i call wisdoms.
I am going to read you a series of statements, and i want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.
do not do what i say, say what i do.
just getting warmed up.
mistakes are just successes that you mess up.
this... you know this is a scale of one to ten?
ok. do you want me to repeat that?
everybody please stand, and get up on your desks.
just stand right up.
that is, yep a little flimsy.
umm... ok... ahh... alright, no more desks.
oh ok. i have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow.
simple...  kids love candy bars.
let us try a little... little social experiment here.
raise your hands if you like to buy things.
ok, i see some people who like to buy things.
you are it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause.
say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not?
so say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers.
something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.
oh, oh, i take umbrage to that premise...ses.
umm, let me ask you this: how many people exist in the world?
over forty billion.
what are they going to be writing on... rocks?
any one else?
yep.
no no no no no.
never follow, always lead.
ok. very good.
ok. bop bop de bope bop bop bop bop bop.
you only have me for a limited time... yes.
how can i put this?
that question makes you sound gay.
can you confirm that the straps are tight?
and now, the chains.
a lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids.
and that is why so many other people in my class were kids.
self fulfilling prophecy.
it is um, it is really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
magic magic magic magic magic magic... and now, michael the magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage.
can he do it?
i do not see how he can.
no.
no.
everyone, now count down with me.
three!
i will get out.
oh yes, i will.
no.
alright, this is getting hot.
so let us just do this.
ok, ready?
three, two, one, go.
ahhhh!
yes.
i cannot tell you how i plan to escape.
other than by using magic.
that is the magician's code.
separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key... alright.
ready?
come on guys.
early worm gets the worm.
pam, would you smell my breath?
"michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the cfo, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company.
and jan and i are going as a couple.
for the first time.
so it is kind of our coming out party.
really.
and that is why tonight is so special.
jimbo, last chance to carpool.
sure?
might be a good idea.
go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
play some games?
i spy?
oh, sure.
really did not give it any thought.
wait, should you be going?
heh-woh you.
hey, buttercup.
i am on my way.
i should be there in about 15... that is what she said.
uh, yes you are.
no problem.
ok. ok. january jan?
this party is actually a really big step for us.
so, i... ummm... i do not know.
maybe.
ok. alright.
bye.
beauty.
thank you sir!
thank you.
shut up.
ok, change shirts with me.
i do not care.
oh, wow.
here.
do not put my jacket.
do not give me that.
yes.
ok. hi.
actually, it is polite to arrive early.
and smart.
only really good friends show up early.
ergo de facto.
go to a party really early.
become a really good friend.
oh, um, potato salad.
no, it is not.
oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
it is been sitting in my car all day.
sun beating down on the mayonnaise.
just, you never know.
what are you looking for?
you bring dip?
awesome.
I am going to frame mine.
i could frame yours too.
over our love.
you do not have to, january this contract says it all.
it is a heart.
i love this woman!
rachel.
boy, you clean up good.
place looks great with all the lights on.
and everything.
actually looks bigger with people in it.
it is weird.
so... jan and i are lovers.
it feels so good to finally say that out loud.
ok. it did.
like butter.
mike myers, snl.
you should ask karen, she was one of them.
yeah, but you are great now, right?
we are all great.
are not we great?
i could go for an appeteaser.
bagel bites or something.
dwight, wow.
that is not appropriate.
david, how much did this house cost?
here is to mr. iacocca and his failed experiment, the de lorean.
yeah.
do you have any ice?
how about some splenda?
this one really smells like vanilla.
check that out.
you and the misses should join us at sandals jamaica next christmas.
oh yeah, they do not allow kids at sandals.
they are persona non gratis... there.
but it is fun.
it is an awesome place.
you would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
crazy.
ok. excuse me.
what is going on?
what is it?
what are you doing?
yes, but you could tell me.
what... what is that?
why are you?
why are we going in the bathroom?
i thought this is where you liked your privacy.
what has gotten into you?
no, no, no.
come on, let us go back to the party.
do not take that dress.
stop it, january no, no, no, means please do not.
please.
I am not going to slam you up against the wall.
you are acting inappropriate.
january rachel thinks that i brought homemade potato salad and i just picked it up at the supermarket.
it is funny.
i wish i could make potato salad that good.
it is just potatoes and mayonnaise.
there is something wrong with january our first fight.
if this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle... you did not have any of the potato salad did you?
well, if that is the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
I am not going to cry.
i feel like it but i am not going to.
why do not you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
i want the house, january i want the picket fence.
i want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
whatever.
that is all, you did not mean it?
i love you, january what a weird day.
i do not understand it, but you do not get to understand everyday of your life.
maybe five, ten days a year, I will get home and i will have no idea what the hell just happened.
guess everybody has days like that.
sometimes they are the nicest ones.
still, i think there might be something wrong with january no need for consternation, everything is under control.
it was a crime of passion, jan, not a disgruntled employee.
everyone here is extremely gruntled.
no... no, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he is just using this roy thing as leverage.
yeppers.
i do not... remember.
yeesh... ok i want you to be darryl and ask me for a raise, because i want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
wikipedia.
wikipedia... is the best thing ever.
anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
ok, darryl, ask me for a raise.
hmm, well that is interesting darryl.
i think...  that maybe you should... what I am saying is that, ok, see what i did?
by leaning back, and by whispering, i established a dominant physical position.
ok, let us try another one.
um... walking out of the room unexpectedly.
it is a surprise.
go ahead, ask me for a raise.
what?
no, what did you say?
oh it... sounded interesting... what you were going to... yeah.
yes, yeah, absolutely.
have a seat.
you know what?
actually, let us go into the conference room.
no, you know what?
let us stay here.
no let us go... yeah let us go to the conference room.
tactic number six.
change the location of the meeting at the last second.
totally throws  them off.
number 14, declining to speak first.
makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
i am declining to speak first.
hmm.
ohh, darryl.
you are a good worker, and a good man.
i just, you know, times are tight.
and i just do not think corporate is going to go for this right now.
what?
no, this is a power suit.
i do not buy woman's clothes.
i would not make that mistake again.
ohh... kay.
all right.
alright, you know what?
pam, could you please tell darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
no, i do, i, i wear men's suits, ok?
i got this out of a bin.
there were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and i grabbed one.
and it fit!
so i do not think that this is totally just a woman's suit.
at the very least it is bisexual.
uh,  missterious.
and it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that is the mystery.
okay.
would you stop it, please?
it is european, ok?
it is a european cut.
no, they do not.
see?
italians do not wear pockets.
no, i do not want to do that because I am twice your size anyway.
um, let us just do this in 15 minutes.
negotiations are all about controlling things.
about being in the driver's seat.
and make one tiny mistake, you are dead.
i made one tiny mistake.
i wore woman's clothes.
let us get down to business.
why do not you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
that was a very good point.
you make a very compelling argument.
i am going to give you a piece of paper.
i want you to write down how much you want, and i want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
because, that is the way these things are done.
in... films.
no, slide-- slide it, yes.
oh.
come on.
be serious.
i... i can not give you that, i-- i do not make this much.
i do not.
want me to prove it to you?
there is... a pay stub.
plus perks, yes.
fourteen years.
no, please, please... ok, let us take 15, again.
a boss's salary is not just about money, it is about perks.
it... for example, every year i get a $100 gas card... can not put a price tag on that.
oh, thank you.
i did not give you $40.
okay.
okay, here is the straight... dope.
no tricks.
no wikipedia.
i talked to corporate, and they told me that i can only give you a 5% raise.
well what am i supposed to do?
I am not going to go out and ask for a raise right now.
that is ridiculous.
that is true.
you know what?
i should.
i have been a loyal employee for a long time.
you know what?
i deserve a bump.
i am makin' it happen, sergeant.
no, january  I have never asked for a raise in 14 years.
this is long overdue.
i want to do it today.
yshhyah.
um, yeah.
I will leave right away.
yes, I am bringing darryl.
mm-hm.
hey, I would rather kill myself.
no, toby is terrible.
toby is the worst human being I have ever known.
fine.
toby, come on.
let us go.
where?
I am going to smack you in the head with a hammer.
come on, let us go.
yeah.
fine.
do not ever touch a black man's radio!
...chris tucker.
<i>rush hour</i>.
i will not touch yours, by the way.
well... mm, the big apple.
maybe I will stay.
well... oh, i... pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
all right.
who is the boy toy?
were you going to tell me that you hired james van der beek?
be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
pippity poppity.
six percent?
after all we have been through?
i got you... jade earrings.
no!
no.
you going to play it like this?
you give me a good raise, or no more sex.
what are you writing, perv-ball?
why do not you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.
this is me, january  this is me!
okay, no, no, no, no.
you do not try tactic number eight on me.
i invented tactic number eight.
I am not going anywhere.
ohh.
it was a weird day.
i accidentally cross-dressed.
and then darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.
and then i had to ride up here with stupid toby.
and then, your assistant, is all young and hot.
and i-- well that is ridiculous I am not going to make-- ah, so...  all right, levinson.
here is the rub.
i would like a 15% raise.
but you just said 15. negotiation is an art.
back and forth.
give and take.
and today, both darryl and i took something.
higher salaries.
win win win.
but you know, life is about more... than just salaries.
it is about perks.
like having sex with jan- look, i am not a gazillionaire.
i can not... i can not dress like donald trump dresses.
i have to stay within the parameters of my budget.
i can not shop at a fancy norwegian boutique.
i buy my suits the old fashioned way.
i buy them from discount stores... or on ebay.
and when i found out that ross was having a midnight madness sale, i ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.
and i got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.
and i did too.
and i grabbed this suit.
and a woman, sort of a, i do not know, missy elliot type, grabbed the jacket.
and, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.
and i could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.
and i figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.
um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.
and she got it, she got the suit.
but, i went to the ross, in trenton new jersey, and i found the exact same suit.
and i did not have to deal with missy elliot.
today is safety training day.
toby is leading ours upstairs.
yeauck.
but, i am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.
we are going to listen in on darryl's presentation to the warehouse.
and if i know darryl, it going to be zoppity.
hmm.
i can, and i have.
guys, I am not the only one who is driven the forklift.
pudge has driven the forklift.
i thought your name was pudge?
okay.
um, her.
ah, fine.
yeeesh.
"hey darryl, how is it hangin'?
!" bail'er?
i hardly know her.
yes, yes.
but it would not be the worst thing in the world... if somebody... it is a big red trash compactor!
okay, okay!
i got it.
i got it.
...  only on the rarest of occasions... ...would i go near-- toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.
let me rephrase that.
i believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as darryl.
here we go!
yes, good.
fine.
like stretching and... wow, that is... that time really adds up.
that is like... a half an hour, every hour?
ok, you know what?
you are making it sound kind of lame.
so, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.
like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
ok, you know what?
i think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.
sorry, he is very lame.
um, let us see.
"seasonal affective disorder!
a depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter." ok guys, you know what?
i did not-- i did not interrupt when you were having your presentation.
yes.
okay, let us do another one.
this is a good one.
"a particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute--" yes.
"which can contribute to heart disease."  heart disease kills more people that balers.
mmmm, no, no, it is... sedentary... no.
darryl, i did not walk out in the middle of yours.
so, i-- okay.
... what, nerf is not cool anymore?
darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.
i worked in a warehouse.
men's warehouse.
i was a greeter.
I would like to see darryl greet people.
probably make  them feel like wimps.
not me, i...  "hello, I am michael.
welcome to men's warehouse.
we have a special on khaki pants today." ... this is one example.
pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
working in an office can lead to depression.
which can lead to suicide.
i mean this is really serious stuff.
i-- i--  nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a nerf, that... yeah... you are... ah, so right.
they had visual aids.
and all we had were the facts.
you do not go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.
you go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
indubitably.
they use props.
they use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
i do not know, i do not know.
because you know what our killer is?
depression-- nn-- depression.
yes.
you may be asking yourself, "what am i doing on a trampoline?"  well, i thought I would bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.
not!
here is the plan.
dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we are going to have another safety seminar.
only this time, where is michael?
oh my god!
he is on the roof!
now i have got their attention.
i... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.
and then i say, "hey!
you ever seen a suicide?"  and i jump.
and they freak out.
and they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.
nice side note: they might think "hey, i should have been nicer to michael."  but that is... not why I am doing this... then, i land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.
i climb off, walk around the corner... ta-freakin'-da!
maybe we should test it first.
letterman-style.
throw a tv over, or... go buy some watermelons.
just... let us do it!
drop that sucker.
bingo!
whoa whoa whoa!
oh... crap.
deactivate the car alarm.
clean up the mess.
find out whose car that is.
if it is stanley's, call the offices of james p. albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
have pa-adge do it, or... the sea monster.
yes, thank you for seeing that.
i do not know if i want to do this.
no.
no more.
the tests are going terrible.
if we keep doing it, we are not going to want to jump.
this is about doing, not thinking.
rock n' roll!
that is right!
i am not thinking.
yes!
yeah!
woo!
woo!
i am ready to do this!
i am ready to make a point!
my life!
oh, my life... everything's wrong.
the stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
dwight, you ignorant slut.
depression is a very serious illness.
over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!
according to a 2004 study!
yes!
my head is in such pain!
and turmoil!
wait, where are the warehouse guys?
okay... that is... that is the whole point, dummy.
okay.
oooooh, my life!
everything is wrong, dwight.
the stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
dwight, you ignorant slut.
and that is why, i am going to jump off this roof!
damn it.
what is it?
dwight, find out what the present is.
dwight, you are such a liar.
pam, really, what is it?
you told me, that i lead a... cushy, wimpy, nerf life.
what do i have to live for?
it is complicated with january  and i do not know where i stand, or what i want.
the sex is not nearly as good as it used to be.
do you really mean that?
I am braver than you?
i braveheart.
i am.
okay.
pam, I am coming down to get my present.
an office... is as safe as the people in it.
and sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.
that is the danger i found myself in today.
i saved a life.
my own.
am i a hero?
i really can not say.
but, yes.
ok, come on everybody, go time.
pam let us go.
do not worry pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... your long lovely life.
saved it.
here we go.
field trip.
like we are going to the science museum.
learn by touching.
I have been told that I am a tactile learner.
kelly, ryan looks great.
you should be thankful that you... i... sum it up darryl, sum it up.
we got beat today, dwight.
but it was not a fair fight.
it was the warehouse guys... ... dwight, they embarrassed us... ... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
you know what is funny?
robin williams.
when a cat gets stuck in a washing machine.
city slickers.
talking like borat.
you know what is not funny?
safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety.
not nice.
i must show people how dangerous office can be.
high five... now that is funny.
how do you make depression sexy?
how do you... how do you get people interested in depression?
that is the conon... the conun... the conumbery those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls.
well I am going to show them that we have nerfs of steel.
yeah, drew.
you know drew, why do not you go inside.
dwight come here.
where should we put this?
ok, good.
thank you.
want to take our time, do this right.
I am going to wait.
i do not want to say this twice, it is too painful and I am too depressed.
i will miss you the most ryan.
coal miners, crab fishermen, dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs.
but also upper middle management.
wow!
i could have fallen off a roof today... and you do not worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... and there are no roofs in coal mines.
it is disgusting.
i totally agree.
well, we are going to recalling all of that paper.
we have a crisis.
apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.
five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.
I have never been a fan.
everybody in here.
stat.
no time to lose.
cri-man-squa.
f and c, doubletime.
crisis management squad.
front and center.
twice as fast as you would normally go.
any other questions?
to save time, jim.
you know what?
bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!
forget it.
where is creed?
creed.
quality assurance.
your job.
i really think you screwed the pooch on one, creed.
because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
we have a lot of angry customers out there.
this puts us at threat level midnight.
accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
<i>midnight, oscar!</i>  do not worry, kelly will be training you first.
jim, big fire in your house.
your client, dunmore high-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.
went home to all the kids.
no, no, no, no.
not good enough.
this is a keystone account.
i want you in the school.
in person.
i want you to bring a partner.
no, sweet cheeks.
we need someone who is actually made a sale.
andy, you go.
no, no.
i need two men on this.
that is what she said.
no time!
but she did.
no time!
guys, get on this.
dwight, i want you to be in charge of the press conference.
no, pam.
the press is just going to find out by themselves.
here is the thing.
when a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.
alert the media, and then you control the story.
wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.
that is what happened to of.j.
i have invited barbara allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.
the press wants a story, i will give them a story.
<i>here</i> is your headline.
"scranton area paper company, dunder mifflin, apologizes to valued client.
some companies still know how business is done."  okay?
battle stations everybody, let us go, go, go, go, go, go!
ok, press conference in 45.  dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
mrs. allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.
even though she is a pretty unimportant client, really.
and so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, i would like to say that dunder mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.
and, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, mrs. allen, i would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
so, let us consider this matter ended.
i know, i know you are angry.
and we are truly, truly sorry.
well, we are extremely sorry.
we... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
the watermark... it is a one time thing.
ok... what... can i do, for you?
well...  ok, well...  um, was not really my fault.
the guys at the papermill-- the guys at the papermill-- no no no!
<i>I am</i> the head of the company?!
no, I am a regional manager-- no-- my-- ok, this is insane.
you can get out of here.
get out!
that is insane.
we will give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
does not matter.
out please!
yeah, well I am calling the ungrateful bi-atch hotline!
did you get all that?
we got to do something.
this is spinning out of control, pam.
this is just, not... no, then newsweek picks it up.
and then cnn does a story about it.
then... youtube gets a hold of it... you are right.
it will blow over.
but it is not... going to take... a week or two.
do you know what this is for?
ok, i think that is good.
"hello.
i am michael scott, regional manager of dunder mifflin scranton.
by now you are probably sick of hearing about dunder mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.
let me tell you something.
something from the heart.
i am not leaving this office.
it will take a swat team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that." that is how devoted i am to this job.
i know.
i understand that, dwight.
do you think you are taking it a little... literally, dwight?
and now we are wasting tape.
I am going to have to cut this all out.
can you say cut?
so I will know where-- I am asking pam to do it, please.
ok, ready?
five, four, three.
"there is no way, i will resign.
it would not be fair.
not to the good workers i work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.
let us not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.
if i could leave you with one thought, remember... it was not me.
they are trying to make me an escape goat.
if i am fired, i swear to god, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the f-word on it.
the f-word.
you have one day." that is... they always give an ultimatum.
good, cut?
thought so too.
the key to a crisis is dealing with it right away.
like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles.
if you do not act fast, you will lose customers.
with dissatisfied clients, it does not matter what you did.
all they want to hear is that you are sorry.
they are like women that way.
and this client is a woman.
so when i say I am sorry, it will be twice as effective.
so we are good?
I am sorry.
okay.
all right.
we are infinitely sorry.
you understand?
you... you get this check.
the customer is always right.
mrs. allen was our customer.
she was wrong.
is that a contradiction?
no.
because she is not our customer anymore.
hey, mom.
happy birthday, belatedly.
sorry i forgot.
i had put it on my calendar and pam threw that out.
and without denying the seriousness of the situation, i would just like to remind you that in much of the netherlands, swimming naked is the norm.
so in norway, you would be the weirdos.
are we ready?
okay.
am i shiny?
okay.
we good?
okay, that is enough aqua net.
stop it.
i have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign.
calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike.
well let me tell you something, something from the heart.
i will not resign.
i need this job.
my mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month.
with this job, i can barely cover that.
i have a company car, but i still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high.
and i have no savings whatsoever.
and it was not even me.
it is so not fair that they want me to resign.
what is happening?
really?
is she ok?
ok.  phyllis, you say?
hmm.
um... i mean did he even see pam?
or, uh... karen from behind?
I am sorry.
it is pretty funny when you think about it.
oh, ok. masters of comedy.
a guy dropped his pants.
have you ever been to the circus?
ok.  he is back!
ok. hmm.
waagh!
what?
oh.
oh, phyllis got flashed.
it is, uh... oh, come on.
we are laughing at phyllis, but she is not even here, so no harm, no foul.
incidentally, where were you during all of this?
maybe you are the flasher.
uh-huh.
prove it.
let us see your penis.
i... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, i knew that it was wrong.
in all the excitement, i forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe.
women can not have fun if they do not feel safe.
for example, jan and i have a safe word in case things go too far.
foliage.
and if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop.
although last time... she pretended she did not hear me.
huh?
i do not know.
i feel... i drive a lot.
I am spending a fortune on gas and tolls - um, that... i do not know.
that makes me kind of uncomfortable.
i... uh, well, i do not know.
i am sick over this thing.
those people out there are clearly afraid.
and that can not happen.
not in my house.
ok. this is the last <i>thing</i> that phyllis needs to see right now, dwight.
dwight, are those your pants?
that is a polaroid.
attention, everybody.
dwight has something he would like to say.
ok, you know something, dwight?
we are not the terrorists.
why do not you just take these women, put  them in a burlap sack, and hit  them with a stick?
because that is what you are doing.
i celebrate these women.
they deserve the right to dress as they please.
if pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to.
i encourage that.
see?
that is what we are talking about.
did you hear that, dwight?
no, dwight.
respect.
r-e-s-p-svee-t. find out what it means to me.
all right, you know what?
that is it.
conference room, five minutes.
women's appreciation.
oh, i do not know, james.
did i come from a woman?
have i slept with a woman?
more than one?
that is not current.
you know what?
i am the expert.
i will conduct it.
i know the crap out of women.
i, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
nobody likes to be flashed.
when meredith flashed me at that christmas party, i nearly vomited.
ok, no catfights.
please.
let us - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman.
but in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
what are...?
shut it.
shut.
up.
ok, so what i want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations.
magazines and tv shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses.
well, look around.
are women like that?
no.
no, they are not.
even the hot ones are not really that skinny.
so what does that say?
that says that you women are up against it.
and it is criminal.
society does not care.
society sucks.
i do not even consider myself a part of society.
fyi.
because i am so angry over all of this.
yes.
thank you.
that was not necessary, but i appreciated it.
and i proves my point.
women can do anything.
no.
I am being misogynistic.
that is insane.
i am not being sexist.
yes.
because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
i have to know whether you are serious or not.
ye - ok, yes.
you are right.
you are right, you are right.
and you know why?
it is because of where we are.
this is a masculine environment.
we need to find a place where you feel comfortable.
you know where we are going to go?
the steamtown mall.
ok, let us go, ladies of dunder-mifflin.
hey, we should have a calendar printed up.
pam, put that in my good idea folder.
let us go!
i do not think she is going to make it.
do not think she is going to make it - many women <i>are</i> competent drivers.
ok. come on.
all right.
hope nobody's on a diet.
you are welcome.
you are welcome, you are welcome.
ok. so, let us dish.
anything you guys want.
this is your time.
mm.
what is a pap smear?
or is it "shmear?" like the cream cheese.
what, um... what do you think of role-play?
yeah?
well, jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
i just... i feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
jan says anything that does not scare us is not worth doing.
i do not know.
maybe we are different people.
i like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
and then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
no, it is not that bad.
the worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
no, she is... she is fooling around.
it is a woman thing.
no... no, it is all right.
I am ok. I am ok.  you guys... what are we going to do about jan?
ok. jan is smart.
uh, successful.
good clothes.
hot.
perfect skin.
nice butt.
cons.
wears too much makeup.
breasts: not anything to write home about.
insecure about body.
I am unhappy when I am with her.
flat-chested.
she is totally flat.
shrunken chesticles.
I am unhappy when I am with her.
I am happy sometimes.
um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
yeah, that is smart.
that sounds good too.
i do not know who is right.
i just do not - i do not know.
i do not know.
i want to break up with january wow.
i want to break up with january wow, i cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
oh, hey, guys.
i want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier.
i want you to go in there.
i want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.
come on.
get in here.
let us face it, most guys are from the dark ages.
they are caveman.
and they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants.
but... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
mm.
you do not want anything?
my treat.
some panties or... pick a thong or... g-string.
t-back.
get a nice bra.
padded bra.
see-through, push-up, lace?
thigh-high?
bustier?
any - it just - you know what, i would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
oh.
oh, no.
it is january what do i do?
ok, it stopped.
uh, yeah.
yep.
um... could somebody grab me the lever, and i will... yeah, get your hazards on for safety.
let us see.
there we go!
good.
yes, we have the... all right.
do you have a... a crescent?
a crescent allan?
uh... you know what?
I am going to... you take care of that.
I am going to do traffic... detail.
ok, i am really going to do this.
you know what?
i need my girls with me.
pam, karen, even phyllis.
come on.
let us do this.
let us do it.
i love you guys.
now I am getting her voicemail.
hey, january it is me, michael.
I am just calling to say that i think we need a little break, permanently.
and, uh, i know everybody says this, but i-i want to remain friends.
or at least business associates who get along.
oh, just so you know, it is not me, it is you.
ok, buddy.
somebody just walked in.
i have to go.
um, so I will talk to you later.
thank you.
abso-fruit-ly.
no... no... yeah.
maybe some italian.
"... to remain friends.
or at least business associates -"  chinese?
"who get along.
oh, just so you know, it is not me, it is you.
ok, buddy." any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.
because they are un-understandable.
there is a wishing fountain at the mall.
and i threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish.
i wished for jan to get over me.
i wished for phyllis, a plasma tv.
i wished for pam to gain courage.
i wished for angela, a heart, and for kelly, a brain.
"michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" you mean, how can i be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional?
well, maybe i learned something from women after all.
love it.
uh, yes, i am.
uh, yeah, it is okay.
its just, i do not think the cartoons are very funny.
the a cartoon that goes with each article.
this one says mel karmazin?
i do not, i do not know.
i guess i get it.
we should really start recycling.
orgasms, why can women have them?
yep?
sometimes i imagine what it would be like to be a woman.
i have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before i get dressed i will tuck myself between my legs just to see.
and, um, it is uncomfortable.
so maybe i do understand.
i got shotgun.
damn it.
look at that!
come on!
free underwear!
hey, pam, how bout something like that for you.
could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.
just show off the twins a little bit.
idiot.
i learned a lot about women today.
and any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.
because they are un-understandable.
jan and i broke up.
why?
because she did not like one message i left on her voicemail?
but that is her peariagative.
i thought i understood women, but maybe, can not believe I am going to say this, maybe, women do not understand themselves.
ughh... blech.
just... all over.
i do not want to do anything... I am dying... right there.
maybe.
not it.
i do not have eggs.
that is possible.
uh-huh?
the cfo?
ohh... ok, everybody out.
out.
out.
out.
ok. to what do i owe this great honor, david wallace?
and gromit.
jan?
is jan there?
oh, you sigh like january i broke jan's heart, david, and it was awful.
it was... it was never my intention to ruin a life.
but you know what?
sometimes... ...you just gots to get your freak on.
yeah.
hmmm.
really?
wow.
i wish i had prepared something to say.
may god guide you in your quest.
ok, everybody have their towels and swim suits?
we have about an hour and half.
i suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
oscar, you brought your speedo, i assume?
well, you can not swim in leather pants.
I am just yankin' your chain.
not literally.
oh, you know what?
uh, you are not going.
yeah, i know.
I am sorry, toby.
we... um... somebody has to stay here.
i want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and i share after i have passed on to new york.
and if toby is a part of it... then it will suck.
hey pam, i have a very important job for you we are.
we are.
but, i would like you to take notes.
and i want you to find out about people's character.
not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
what happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away?
i will answer your question with a question.
it is like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away.
it dies.
unless you find a new head.
i need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
i want you to write down everything that people are doing all day.
and then type it up, in a way that is helpful.
alright?
this way to the partay bus.
everybody, may i have you attention please?
today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
if you do not like it, stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
or the front of the bus.
or drive the bus.
just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.
funtivities!
and there is a special secret prize for the winner!
okay, you know what?
your enthusiasm's turning people off.
well,  hey pam, did you get that down?
like everything i said and everything they did and... just do not... well write it down before you forget it.
that is... you have just been drawing pictures.
rrrr.
i can not stay mad at you.
here we are ladies and gentlemen.
everybody ready?
last one down is a rotten egg.
watch out for snakes!
alright, find a cozy spot.
everybody settle in.
ok, everybody up!
circle 'round.
let us play some games.
we are situated on the northeast corner of scenic lake scranton.
america's eighth largest indigenous body of water.
it is here that a group of americans will undergo the ultimate challenge.
one day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
just words.
inspiring words.
not a contender.
for the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes.
each tribe will have a leader that i will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking.
jim, dwight, andy and stanley.
choose your tribes.
except for pam.
not pam.
jim halpert.
pros: smart, cool, good-looking.
remind you of anybody you know?
cons: not a hard worker.
i can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour.
so that should tell you something.
I am not playing.
dwight is an obvious candidate for my job.
he has the best sales record in the office.
he loves the work.
he is, however, an idiot.
we are going to choose team names.
dwight?
hey, hey, hey.
ok, ok... stanley, your team name?
then i will name your team the red team.
i am also considering stanley because of all the good that black people have done.
for america.
very good.
pam, please take a note that andy is patriotic.
andy bernard.
pros: he is classy.
he gets me.
he went to cornell.
i trust him.
cons: i do not really trust him.
it is time for the great spoon and egg race.
this one is with a little twist.
shh... the person carrying the egg will be blindfolded.
please put on your blindfolds.
that person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail.
first team back is the winner.
alright.
ready?
set.
go!
pam...you are missing things.
okay pam, i have another little project for you.
smart as a whip!
yes!
these are pre-cooked, so it is not absolutely necessary, but i would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I am going to be having.
i would greatly appreciate it.
like umm... ten minutes?
thanks a bunch.
a good manager has got to be hungry.
hungry for success.
ok, who is hungry  no, no, no.
do not touch the food.
please.
not yet.
that is our next event.
a hot dog eating contest.
for those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs.
wow!
and you know what?
i personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record.
so shoot for the stars, ok?
alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner.
on you mark.
get set.
no, i have the only one.
i claimed it.
ready?
guys, guys, guys.
come on!
pleeeeease... let us just... ok, it is very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can.
on your mark.
get set.
eat!
no mustard, no mustard.
just eat it, eat it, phyllis.
dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
i can not say.
the winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
the winner of today gets my job.
ok?
I am interviewing for a job at corporate.
and they are only interviewing a handful of people and I am the most qualified and I will probably get it.
alright?
i did not want to tell anyway.
i did not want to cast a pall over our fun beach day.
but you know what?
i do not know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
word.
there we go.
let us see it.
four.
three.
two.
one.
stop your eating!
and the winner is andy bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
13 hot dogs, everybody!
it is very simple.
there are only three rules.
you must not touch the ground.
you must not step outside of the ring.
and you must always wear the safety mittens.
probably left them in the trunk of my car.
it is alright.
it is alright.
here we go.
aaaaaand, go!
nice, stanley!
one.
two.
three.
excellent!
i knew that finding a successor would be difficult.
i did not know that it would be impossible.
thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing.
uh, jim is not taking it seriously.
uh, stanley is having a stroke.
and andy, where is he?
where the hell is andy?
where is he, pam?
do you know?
ah... who is ahead in points?
check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
please just check.
what does a great manager need most of all?
courage.
your loss, stanley.
meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory.
walking through fire!
who among you has the guts to replace me?
let him walk across these coals.
no.
no, not you, pam.
you have to keep score.
pointless.
blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay?
this is about guts.
it takes guts to be a regional manager.
jim, you are up.
ji.. why not?
c'mon.
you do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
who is next?
andy?
where is andy?
andy is never here today.
because i already did.
remember?
i burned my foot on a george foreman grill.
alright.
okay.
alright.
fine.
'kay.
the mind has to wrap around the foot.
okay.
yes.
count to three, please.
count the other way.
count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
wait!
am i going on go?
or am i going on three?
okay.
do not, do not.
I am not going to give it to you.
being the boss is also about image.
I have never looked like that.
that was gross.
i just, i do not see the connection between a firewalk and management.
worst seventy-five bucks i ever spent.
you know what, if i had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be mr. "outside hire." yeah.
ummm, hmm... true.
look, i do not want to leave this branch that i love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round.
to test the aspect of my job that i think is the most important, something i call the bob hope factor.
god!
he is a comedian.
who is amanda bynes?
oh, i love that movie.
yes, kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a bynes or a hope.
so without further ado, jim and dwight show us what you got.
you are being too modest.
hhhh... okay.
that is not funny.
i am deducting sixty points from voldemort for false pretenses.
okay, dwight your turn.
wow us.
that is a very, very funny story.
pam, that was amazing.
but i am still looking for someone with a sales background.
wwwwiiiillllmmmmaaaa!
so we have about an hour and a half.
i suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus.
fun on wheels.
only way to travel.
besides a monorail.
no.
no, no, no.
no guests today.
classic gang only.
just us good friends, and karen and andy.
pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together.
how did that work out?
acrimonious.
this way to the party bus.
good.
it is a bus that takes you to a party.
here we go.
here we go.
come on.
okay, everybody here?
then, mr. driver, we are off like a herd of turtles!
johnny carson.
nothing.
no.
no!
no.
no, we are not.
you are really annoying me.
if you do not knock it off... ...I am never going to tell you anything ever again.
stop it!
stop it!
stop it!
no.
we are only 10 minutes from the lake.
yes, i am choosing my apprentice.
which is why i have modeled all my games after survivor.
any questions?
yup.
yes, for dramatic affect.
very good, jim.
pam, please note that jim is very astute.
all right, are we ready?
set!
go!
okay.
pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
because he was not following the rules.
but they did not complete their task, pam!
if people can not carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?
exactly.
are you sure you are doing that right?
taking an awfully long time.
okay, all right.
it is very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can... son of a bitch.
god!
okay.
all right you know what?
here we go.
on your mark!
get set!
no mustard!
no mustard!
just... eat it.
eat it, phyllis.
dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
no, no, no, no, not that-- just... come on, you guys, let us do it!
I am serious.
who is got the hungry?
who is got the hungry?
come on, ryan... ryan, i want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth.
right now.
ready!
go!
you?
you have not made a sale.
do not try to flirt your way into this.
sometimes you really creep me out.
andy bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!
dwight schrute is a close second with three and a half!
here comes stanley!
here comes stanley, with three hot dogs!
this is an inflatable sumo suit.
now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.
well, times have changed.
and it is not even about who is the best sumo wrestler.
it is about who is the best boss.
and i do not even care who wins.
it is how they wrestle in a blow-up suit...  that will tell me all i need to know  or how sumo... david!
are we all set?
yes.
i just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I would drop in and say hello.
thought I would catch a show.
naaah.
you know what?
since I am here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
um, how many people are you interviewing?
ah, well, good.
out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than i have, or manages more people?
great.
one more... question.
when you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
ah, great.
no further questions.
okay.
and I am really looking forward to working with you.
i got it made in the shade.
i know this company.
the other branch managers are total morons.
hey, pam yeah, i forgot what day the interview was and i drove to new york accidentially.
I will be like three hours late.
yeah.
yes, the time has come to name my own replacement.
so please hand this letter of congratulations to dwight k. schrute.
okay.
uh... uh, okay.
stop crying.
ohhhhh... why so you can do it?
no, um, well i was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?
convoys are really fun.
pull up next to each other, give each other the finger... moon each other.
all right.
your loss.
cruise control.
there they are, the accounting department.
i shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
no.
not at all.
i have not talked to jan since we broke up, and i think if she had something to say she would have called me.
no, no, no.
you know what?
it is a done deal.
i basically have the job already.
there is nothing she can do to stop it now.
i already sold my condo.
yes, i... i have to buy another place.
i sold it on ebay.
the buyer was very motivated, as was i. it went for eighty percent of what i paid.
sold in record time.
who is d. abramson?
why... are you here?
I am good.
how are you, janet?
it is good to see you.
why privately?
okay, sure, fine.
um, why do not you wait in my office.
i have some important business matters to take care of.
okay.
pam, defcon ten.
houston, we have a problem.
uh, i may need some immediate assistance.
if you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room.
phyllis, angela, karen.
no.
she is an alternate.
so, how you been?
good.
yeah.
weird.
yeah, i did not get both of your messages.
hmm.
sound good.
sounds fun.
hmm.. would you excuse me for a second?
defcon twenty.
she wants to get back together.
i do not know, that is why you are here, help me.
please... no, no.
what do i do?
what if she makes me?
she made me do a lot of things i did not want to do.
i was not.
you are right.
you are absolutely right.
I am going to go in there and tell her that we can not be together.
wow.
I am in a very good place right now.
thank you.
okay.
jan, we need to talk.
jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances.
so i am going to hear her out.
yeah.
first got priorities.
let us get back together.
no.
no, no, no, no.
I will tell you this, it is <i>not</i> because of the boob job.
excuse me, boob enhancement.
that would be shallow.
and this is the opposite of shallow.
this is... emotionally magnificent.
remarkable.
wait, wait.
check one more time.
very good yes, indeed.
so, i guess we are getting back together.
your advice was good, but jan's was bigger.
here is the sitch.
two weeks ago, i was in the worst relationship of my life.
she treated me poorly.
we did not connect, i was miserable.
now, I am in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.
love is a mystery.
hey, everybody.
the next time you see me, I will be working for corporate.
starting tomorrow, dwight schrute will be running the branch.
so without further ado,   i would like to start saying my goodbyes  okay.
goodnight, and good luck.
how are you guys doing?
need anything?
i have been here a bunch of times, so i know where everything is, know everybody's names.
if you need to know somebody is name, just ask me.
<i>that</i> is beardy.
mm-hmm.
no, no, no, just... that is not his real name.
that is just what i call him, so... i am by far the most qualified person they are interviewing.
jim and karen are here, which is cute.
they are like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.
except daddy... is the best actor around.
daddy is meryl streep.
hey!
hunter!
wha's up my brutha?
this is hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
jan in yet?
could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
just say, "i want to squeeze them."  it is code.
she will know what it means.
oh, and hunter?
could you tell her,  "brbrbrbrbr!" also?
hello, hello!
good to see you.
here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
why do not i tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?
i work too hard.
i care too much.
and sometimes i can be too invested in my job.
well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
thank you.
I have never been a big fan of the name dunder mifflin.
i was thinking we could name the company something like, "paper great.
where great paper is our passion.
we are grrrrrrrrrreat!"  i do not know, could be good.
or, uh, "super duper paper.
it is super duper."  i do not know, something like that.
okay.
thank you.
it is always a treat when <i>our</i> paths cross.
so, oh!
before i forget, i wanted to let you know, if you had not already heard, uh, jan and i are back together.
so... i may need to fill out one of those love documents again.
yes.
and i am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.
mm, that is not sexual, just... we are all professionals.
i do not understand.
so, we are going to tag team it?
hey.
pretty good.
could have gone better i guess.
cool.
maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
daaah, let us just run away together.
let us just run away to jamaica and live in a bungalow.
you have some savings right?
you could pay off my debts.
it would... be fine.
we would have fun.
i can not tell you.
wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, jan-- hey!
<i>you are</i>  unstable!
no-- we are all unstable.
david, i did not tell her.
so, i am going to... give her a ride home.
let me know about the job.
good, I am glad we are on the same page.
i have a lot of ideas for new directions.
you know what?
that... is actually good... because, um, i do not think i could take... my girlfriend's job.
that is not being a good boyfriend.
so, i respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.
do you accept my withdrawal?
good.
very good.
I am glad we are finally on the same page.
still have my job in scranton, though.
good.
that is all i ever wanted.
these two.
either one of them... excellent candidates.
i know.
i know, I am sorry about that.
that was terrible.
well, it is...  no, do not cry, it is going to be ok. i do not know.
well i guess... you could come and stay at my condo.
i think i could back out of the sale.
probably get some negative feedback on my ebay profile.
I will be baaaaack!
and i am baaaack!
no.
no, pam.
I am baaaaaack!
for gooood!
kevin nealon.
everybody, may i have your attention please?
it is with great honor and privilege that i announce to you that i have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.
i know, i know, i know.
"michael, what are you thinking?
you were a shoe in."  well, got down there.
i nailed the interview.
and the strangest thing happened.
why is my office black?
that is stupid.
you should not have taken it.
bad management!
good thing I am baaaaaack.
ryan, coffee.
no, it is for me, bimbo.
kids.
so I am back.
and i am never, ever going to leave.
i am going nowhere.
this place... is like... the hospital where i was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
back to work.
still waitin' on that coffee.
well,  I have actually done a lot of thinking about that.
and in ten years, i am living in a big house, with my kids.
and in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and i have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.
and, because it is the future, i can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
well, i do not know what it is going to be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.
and the future... is me.
jan got fired.
and i realized that i could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.
but more than that, i realized that... i could not take a job that would take me away from this place.
this is where i belong.
this is... my home.
and home is where the hardest.
heart is.
that makes a lot more sense.
you think they would help each other out like that at corporate?
i think not!
new york real estate.
i started by looking for a brownstone, like the huxtables had,  but instead i found this very, very, nice place in jamaica, queens, mon.
it is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if i fall asleep, i still end up at home.
it is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.
i have a roommate, uh, vijay chokalingham, he is a sophomore at queens college.
he actually works in the indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.
so, win/win.
ok, well i did not get the job in new york, but i got the real prize, domestic bliss.
jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk.
it is soy.
this is why i do it, that is what i have to come home to.
she probably will not be up for a few hours.
this is going to be a very good year.
very good.
jan is at home.
jim is back.
my protege ryan is at corporate.
good stuff.
um... andy and dwight are rockin' the sales team.
i feel very blessed.
ladies and gentlemen.
i have some bad news.
meredith was hit by a car.
it happened this morning in the parking lot.
i took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life.
they did the best that they could... and she is going to be ok. yes.
she has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
yeah.
gah.
kind of a good news bad news there.
i was able to be on the scene so quickly because i was in the car that hit her.
yeah, it is only meredith, thank god.
but did you see the way they looked at me?
like i was a murderer or something.
it was an accident.
no.
my lord my liege.
so ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond.
whereas back here in scranton i am still top dog, in a fairly large pond.
so who is the real boss?
the dog or a fish?
so i need a little treat for the gang.
something to win their affections back.
well, i ran down meredith in my car.
no, i was being negligent.
but she is in the hospital, she is fine, recovering nicely.
tiny little crack in her pelvis.
but she will be up in... yes.
it was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.
oh, right, I am sorry.
what is: we are fine?
ok, i have an announcement.
no.
no!
that is not funny, i love my employees, even thought i hit one of you with my car.
for which i take full responsibility.
look I am just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things.
so i thought we should plant a tree.
so, like a freedom tree.
pam.
pam.
ok, good good, so we will just all go down there together at lunch.
excellent!
good work pam.
yaaaaaay, pam!
alright, since i am the boss i will drive as well.
who wants shotgun?
everyone inside the car was fine, stanley!
guess what, i have flaws.
what are they?
oh, i do not know.
i sing in the shower.
sometimes i spend too much time volunteering.
occasionally I will hit somebody with my car.
so sue me... no, do not sue me.
that is the opposite of the point that I am trying to make.
eww.
i hate hospitals.
in my mind they are associated with sickness.
oh... she looks like an angel.
no... ok, she always looks like that... that is not my fault.
no... she is in a coma.
ok... meredith,  ooooohhhhh.
i brought all your friends from the office dear.
yeah.
brought you some balloons.
why do not we... here you go.
tie these up, cheer up your tubes...  oh!
shhhh... for god's sake!
nurse.
i am going to be sick... I am going to puke.
oh, ok... wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second.
you know what i was thinking might be sort of fun?
is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
because you know what they say in the bible about forgiveness?
forgiveness is next to godliness.
well, just shhhh... just just... look, i just... i do not understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
come on.
[starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
do i need to be liked?
absolutely not.
i like to be liked.
i enjoy being liked.
i have to be liked.
but it is not like a compulsive need to be liked.
like my need to be praised.
ok, you know what?
everybody, let us just get over the whole meredith thing.
she cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack.
she going to be fine, so let us just... sprinkles?
oh, sh... I am sorry angela.
man what a day huh?
how could it get any worse?
her computer crashes with the porn, and then meredith with the accident, and then... sprinkles!
god, that is 3 things.
I will tell you what is going on.
this office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
well, i am taking responsibility.
it is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit meredith with my car.
I am not superstitious, but... I am... i am a little-stitious.
did anyone do anything involving an indian burial ground?
like park on it.
or dig up a body... toby?
anything you want to tell us?
perfect.
so our tragedy is your good luck.
satan.
dwight, you have not seen meredith yet, have you?
well, i think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
alright, i would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
satan is a master of lies.
everything he says is the opposite.
thank you for the permission.
psych!
alright let us just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
ok. alright.
kelly, you are hindu, so you believe in buddha.
are you sure?
what are you?
ok, 1 sikh, and... you spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.
and it is not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case.
does not make any sense... god is dead.
maybe believing in god was the mistake.
what did people believe in before?
the sun?
maybe there is some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too.
like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion.
or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat.
or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
oh god, rabies?
i was in the hospital room with her.
how contagious is that, is that like an std?
this place is so cursed.
i know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering meredith's life by hitting her, with my car.
but it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
turns out meredith has been exposed to rabies.
which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis.
thanks to me she went to the hospital and i saved her life.
curse is broken.
curse is broken people!
oh... there is a god, and he has a plan for us after all.
so go home get some rest, very very good work today.
we got a lot accomplished.
is there a god?
if not, what are all the churches for?
and who is jesus' dad?
pro-am.
a woman should not have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies.
but that is where we are in america.
and that does not sit right with me.
and that is why I am hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies.
to raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies.
a disease that has largely been eradicated in the us.
but not very many people know that.
hi stanley, how many sponsors so far?
come on man, got to step it up!
it is for a good because.
jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
that... is for a good because.
phyllis, how is the rabies quilt coming?
oh, look at that, 3. way to honor meredith, phyllis.
yes.
ok. alright, alright.
shhh... i know that you are probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
ok, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power.
a person who had money, could buy food, person of respect.
like the regional manager of the day.
whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... and i was a peasant.
well, you are going to have to run, or you are going to be in a lot of trouble.
it is not olden times anymore.
we have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and january um... when do they put that on the giant check?
or is that something that we write in later?
hmm... that is a tough decision.
um... i always imagined it with a giant check.
so... yep.
you did not contribute very much.
i was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor.
and how is that been going?
what about a rabies nurse?
that is possible.
look into that.
have you met that kid?
he is not going to college.
come in.
hey, hey, hey what are you doing?
no i did not, just please do not... may i enter the room?
see how i did that.
that is the way you should enter a room.
you knock and then you wait for the all clear.
yes, but i have an office, so why would i do that.
european offices are naked all the time.
besides my shirt tail covered most of it so... that is not gross, it is the human body.
what is your problem?
pam you are an artist, right?
think of me as one of your models.
ok, you know what, i do not want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it is not fair to people with rabies.
and that is the point, right?
ok, let us go have some fun.
check that out.
look at me, I am toby, I am stretching, i know what I am doing.
why is he even here?
ok everybody, listen up.
thank you for coming.
before we get started i wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies.
and I would like you to take a look into the face of rabies.
that should scare you.
it scares me.
you people need to educate yourselves.
myth: 3 americans every year die from rabies.
fact: 4 americans every year die from rabies.
how many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies?
show of hands.
one, two, three... too many to count.
it is truly the silent killer.
no, it is the foaming barking killer.
and it is something... darryl what are you doing.
no, do not give him... just, did you hear anything i said?
he is happy because he is insane.
you know what, that is the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate.
where is the nurse?
this is the reason we are here.
oh hey, i know you... elizabeth?
right?
wow, very cool you went back and got your degree.
i would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science.
make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
you got it?
ok, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
just remember folks, it is not about winning, it is about finishing.
beow!
on your left!
i am fast!
I am very fast!
I am like forrest gump, except i am not an idiot.
no, no water for me.
not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives.
so... least i could do.
that fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
excellent!
...simpsons.
wait, imodium or ex-lax?
oh god, oh, alfredo sauce.
I am getting a stitch.
take bat bites seriously.
do not get bit.
i am not going to finish.
i can not beat rabies.
nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years.
i was a fool to think that i could beat it.
i can not finish.
i feel so weak, i just... what do you want me to do jim?
no, there are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases.
they are deformed, and they are abnormal, and... they are illiterate and ugly.
symphonies do not have any money.
public tv is bust.
i can not do anything about it, i can not... you know.
there is just one of me, and there is a thousand of them.
and rabies wins.
that is a good deal.
pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
you just do not think i am capable, of making a difference.
you do not, you do not know me.
you have just seen my penis.
i can make a difference, remember, I am the one who started this whole thing off by hitting meredith with my car.
and i owe it to her to finish this... gd 5k  no, no!
finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing i have ever had to do.
i ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than i have in my entire life.
people always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today i had a triumph of the human body.
that is why everybody was applauding for me at the end.
my guts and my heart, and while i eventually puked my guts out, i never puked my heart out.
and I am very, very proud of that.
hey mer.
how ya doing?
it is ironic is not it?
i mean I am in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you are in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
thanks, I am not mad at you anymore.
want to share?
I am not really sick.
nah, I am good.
did you ever think of this?
would a sober person walk in front of a car?
well... that is not... that is not what...no, no, I am not saying that, that is disgusting.
i am saying... that... maybe i was drunk.
did you ever think of that?
okay.
maybe she hit me.
you ever think of that?
she hit me?
i do not know whose fault it was.
i was not exactly looking at the road.
you know what, why do not go around the room and say one memory of meredith.
I will start.
i liked her jumpers.
they reminded me of kindergarten.
jim?
hey!
okay, okay, okay,    you can just close that.
let us just... why can not you just forgive... why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?
how do you know that you were not born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?
I am not going to leave until you forgive me.
oh, okay.
this office is cursed.
and we need to do something about it.
maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.
I am just saying, at least right here  is cursed.
conference room, 10 minutes.
on the one hand, it is a relief to know that it is not just me, the whole office is cursed.
on the other hand, i may have to deal with the dark unknown.
we have to have done something wrong.
that was the curse, stanley, and we are trying to find the because of the curse.
oscar, are you santaria?
oh.
great.
we have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.
yes.
it is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.
stupid.
yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems.
what do i look like to you, paul newman?
that is actually not a good example, because i have been compared to a young paul newman, my eyes and my face.
and i make my own salad dressing.
i mix newman's ranch with newman's italian.
sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.
i could make... i could make a profit if i changed one of the ingredients to wishbone  but i will not do it.
whoa, 'scuse me!
oh!
oh, slow!
oh, ho, ho, ho.
you guys are going so slow... come on, I am going backwards.
oh, all right!
all right!
all right!
all right!
okay!
thanks.
well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.
i will be paying out-of-pocket.
um... i kind of wish I would been hit by a car.
hey, doc?
you forgetting something?
thank you.
hey toby.
what is this?
i just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving pda or public displays of affection.
oh really.
is this about me and jan?
in my office?
because i will have you know that that was consensual.
what we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here.
i do not think.
i do not think anyone heard anything.
we were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point.
so i do not think it is any of your business.
what i think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight... no way.
woooah!
wow!
awesome!
you guys!
yes!
yes!
oh kay, mind is exploding.
get over here.
come on.
come here.
okay, okay,  stand up.
ok, here we go.
everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy.
because today, is the day that jim and pam become one.
i love you guys, so much.
no, no, no pam let  them ring.
let the bells of dunder mifflin chime out your love.
because this is  really good, this is really good.
my heart soars with the eagles nest.
hey.
can you make that straighter?
that is what she said.
no.
blowing up balloons i thought.
pam and jim are together.
ryan is visiting.
only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
hey!
there he is!
there he is!
he is back!
and he is with a beard.
he... he has facial hair.
look at him!
all grown up and no place to go.
hello, mr. sunny crockett.
I am tubs.
ohh, yeah, let us get started because uh, yes, because uh this is very serious business and umm.. ...business meeting -- that is right!
that is right!
fire guy.
do not start any fires, ryan.
look how big he is.
look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now.
you are like our little man... beard.
oh, wow!
that is a little kinky.
i do not swing that way.
woooo!
i think ryan has a gay crush on me.
yes, everybody, come on.
settle town.
let us get serious here.
um ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes?
sounds good.
ok, alright.
yeah, ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that i picked up on, which said, "dude, we are friends.
I am doing this for appearances.
i am the big boss now.
and i have to seem like an ogre.
but you know me and you trust me.
and we like each other.
and we will always be friends.
and i would never take you for granted in a million years.
and i miss you, man.
and i love you." his words.
oohh.
gimmme, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
ryan howard everybody.
good job.
who is?
i am not old.
you are old.
you are like a hundred.
yeah, kay.
i was just... after the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
yeah, i know i understand... we are making great strides and we are updating, but business as usual, no?
good, so, we are on the same page?
we had a foreign exchange student live with us when i was young.
and we called him my brother.
and that is who i thought he was.
um, then he went home to what is now formerly yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him.
and i had to spend the entire winter in shorts.
that is what ryan is like.
a fake brother who steals your jeans.
hey.
hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
i do not want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
oh, i dunno, they are launching a big new business plan.
new website, blah blah blah.
he is being a real twerp about it, so, it is all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
well... what is that... word?
so older people have just as many rights as younger people?
good, we are all here, we can get started.
have a seat.
have a seat.
like everybody else.
still my office, ryan.
well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today.
well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism.
what?
yes, i am right.
did you know that the age discrimination and employment act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older?
i did.
hey, shut up toby.
look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
no, creed, no they are not.
in fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability.
like the old lady from titanic.
or the funny things that they can do, like "where is the beef?"   yeah.
i was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
that is me.
come on in.
who is this old fart?
did you just stagger off the street?
out of a box or something?
who is this worthless bag of bones?
well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of dunder mifflin, mr. robert dunder.
huh?
sure thing.
'scuse me.
fine.
then i will call david wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
bob, how old are you?
eighty-seven years young.
and still active.
that is great.
did you know, that bob is still a member of the board of dunder mifflin?
ah, still sends his own proxy.
good for you.
wow.
oh, boy.
great.
great.
that is great.
thank you for coming in.
robert dunder everybody.
thank you.
that was wonderful.
do you have a ride?
perfect.
inspirational.
what have we learned?
well, we have learned that you can not teach an old dog new tricks, because it is illegal, and you will go to jail.
no, no.
do not help him.
he does not need help, pam.
what a nice guy.
good night guys.
i disagree, i think it was very valuable.
i happen to think the old ways of doing business are better.
and i can prove it.
and the same thing goes for quarterly reports.
they are unreadable.
they are just numbers and boring and blech.
so what i was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud?
and... when we have a good quarter, fireworks?
or a racecar?
does not have to be a racecar.
use your imagination.
we have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white?
yeah!
i know.
i know.
it is bland.
maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
like, something that you have to look for.
sort of a "where is waldo." alright.
alright.
let us quit while we are ahead.
that was awesome.
thank you.
some days i am just on fire.
what can i say?
oh, does he?
mmmmmm.
okay.
attention.
earthlings.
i have some news.
beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.
okay.
today is the big day that i am heading to new york to attend a party with sushi and important people.
on an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before i leave.
thank you.
and... today the dunder-mifflin infinity website officially launches.
well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, ryan.
it is my brain-grandchild.
and, uh, to celebrate it is birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in new york city at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the vip's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh new york city's finest, and i do not mean policemen... the company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.
wow!
watch out dwight.
no.
it does not.
I will find out tonight.
what is that, pipsqueak?
ohh, lunch party.
okay, wow!
easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
okay.
really?
it is the european cut.
umm... hey.
ah, what is hanging?
oh good.
okay cool.
how many pounds do you think i could lose by 7?
i had um, one of those danishes.
why do not you want to go tonight?
what... all your friends are going to be there.
it will be fun.
just... yeah.
thank you.
na... no.
no.
if i go by myself everybody will think I am a big loser.
do i have your permission to invite carol?
I am sorry.
I am sorry.
it is just the first... girl that popped into my head.
I will find somebody i have not slept with.
so.
this is the dealio.
god has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in new york tonight.
what are you doing this evening?
look at that.
they have their own little language now.
like twins.
alright.
well fight it out amongst yourselves.
i was thinking pammy but boys night out is also good.
just let me know who the winner is.
alright.
I am ready to go and I am callin' shotgun.
yes.
thank you.
oh yeah, you would better.
you better say good-bye to pam.
say good-bye to pam.
byyyyyye.
i love you.
i love ya pam... okay.
I am leavin' inside jim's car, i do not know when I will be back again.
yes i do.
tomorrow I will be back.
I will be back.
tomorrow.
um... yeah.
so you know what?
why do not you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
if you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.
see you guys tomorrow.

it is a club called chatroom, and there is a password to get in, which is actually password.
so... what are you doing?
no.
no, I am sure that is not.
na... yes.
well the invitation says vip's only.
is this how you treat your vip's, ryan?
we are already in the city.
the main part with the buildings.
what am i supposed to do?
what do you want me to do tonight?
and if you tell me, that i have to drive back to scranton, to the satellite party, i am going to throw up!
okay I am going to throw up.
I am throwing up.
you are making me throw up, ryan.
you know what this is like?
I will tell you what this is like.
this is like when the freshmen would throw a party and would not let any of the seniors go.
does not it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
yeah.
i withdrew too.
alright who wants to party?
ohhh, what?
oh i think i faked oscar out.
i think i faked stanley out too.
who else thought that i was leaving?
and they could all go home early?
gotcha.
gotcha.
gotcha.
well who needs new york?
right?
we can have a killer party right here in scranton.
nope nope nope no.
this is going to be nothing like the party you have been planning.
this is going to be good and everybody's going to come.
what is wrong with dwight?
oh hey!
good for you.
good for you.
scranton power.
alright you know what?
angela I would like you to come into my office in ten minutes.
bring something to write with and something to write on.
good.
this was a pretty disappointing day.
it was kind of a slap in the face to realize that i was not as important as i thought i was to a certain young executive who i cared about.
but, you know, I am not going to cry over it.
i did that in the car on the way home.
how we doing on time?
good.
these are some things that i would like to have happen.
mmmhmm.
those are just things.
this is how i want it to feel.
i would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important... yes uh... i want it... i want it to embarrass all other parties.
i want it to be a party that the guys in new york watch on the web-cam and say, "wow!
how did they get al roker to come?" yes you can.
yes you can.
i know you can.
i would not say that if i did not hundred percent believe it.
who else could do this?
no seriously.
is there anyone else who could do it better?
because we do not have a lot of time.
I will get the pizza!
good news.
guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, alfredo?
same thing.
you know what?
i do not understand when you all talk at the same time.
pizza by alfredo.
okay, okay, what is better?
a medium amount of good pizza?
or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
yup.
you do not have to say it like that.
hey right, i have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
yeah, i told them on the phone that i was ordering eight pizzas.
you did not actually think i was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
okay, it does not say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it is policy, it should say it on the coupon.
what do you mean hmm-um?
it is your problem.
that is no way to do business, okay?
i ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so i would like eight pizzas for half-off.
end of story.
I am not giving that to you.
no, no you are not going anywhere.
you are staying here until we figure this out.
you know what?
this young man needs to learn that is not how you treat people.
i do not care if it is pizza.
good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.
you do not just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?
dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.
right now, get in the conference room.
yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.
please, thank you.
no, you do not even know what stupid is.
it is about to get all stupid up in here.
you ready to give me my discount now?
okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
alright, dwight, knock it off.
you better think about what you are doing young man.
no!
I am an adult, i do not have to think or do anything.
you are a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he is better than everyone else, because he is some hot shot, and you do not know anything about sales.
so stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
yeah sales, you sell pizza.
last time i checked that is called sales.
alright stop, stop making him say it!
you just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
stop talking all at once!
let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
you know what jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
I am not kidnapping him, I am keeping him until i get what i want.
i think you are over-thinking it.
yes, is alfredo there?
can i speak to a manager then?
okay, can you tell the manager that I am keeping his delivery kid until i get a discount on the eight pizzas i ordered.
yes, i know it is not on the coupon.
also i would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our... trouble.
okay, alright.
he said no.
no, no.
mister overdramatic, what is up kevin?
I will just wave and introduce myself.
hey, i just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.
hey, have you seen jim?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
hey, hey, hey stop it.
stop it now, god.
oh my god, oh my god, no, no, no.
i kidnapped a kid.
i could have paid for the pizza.
oh my god, oh my god.
this is michael.
you are breaking up.
i can not hear you.
mmm-kay.
i want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
i will open the door.
and hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
yes.
see ya, drive safely.
okay.
now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
not now dwight, please, it is not the time.
what a horrible day.
bluh.
well, i need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.
I would really like some sushi.
i was hoping that i would have new york style sushi today.
and you know what?
I am going to get it.
uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic new york style sushi.
new york.
want to go?
alright, you drive.
here we go.
mmm.
hey, you know what?
come on, come on, let us go.
guilty.
oh, thanks.
this is the guy that beat the computer.
yeah.
I am ryan, and tonight did not go the way that i thought it would, because it did not work out for me, and I am very embarrassed.
i got egg all over my face.
i never sold any paper, because I am an idiot.
i made it with my cheese pita.
i started a fire, i started a fire.
and I am hot, I am so hot.
that is why everybody... well, it is part of it, it is just the... uhhh.
want to head back?
what is wrong with me?
i want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me.
do not avoid this.
i know you are dying to say it, so just say it.
what, no.
no.
okay, bags.
i have bags under my eyes, pam.
i did not see it at home, i did not see it in the bathroom, i did not see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light... the big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?
the big round things.
yes.
i have bags under my eyes, and i can not go to new york like this!
what do i do?
what do i do?
really?
that is it?
all right!
martha stewart!
you can be martha stewart's receptionist!
very good!
i will be tea baggin' it.
nn... no.
do i feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that i was invited to?
not at all.
because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.
of course, at that point, i will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.
what are you going to do?
coat!
steak!
where is my steeaaak?
get me armani.
on the phone.
where is armani?
he is on the phone.
too slow.
you are not going to paris.
I am so much better than you are.
i owe you an apology.
yeah.
it was awesome.
big surprise ending.
will not ruin it for you.
meryl streep is the bad guy.
never see it coming.
anyways, if i was mean in any way to you, i am sorry.
i just want what is best for you, mo chuisle.
i have not heard the same about you.
so let us just go with mine.
we already have a sofa.
so why do-- it... folds up.
you have only seen it flat.
i-- ok. how much is this going to cost?
yes.
money has been a little tight lately.
but, at the end of my life, when I am sitting on my yacht, am i going to be thinking about how much money i have?
no.
I am going to be thinking about how many friends i have, and my children, and my comedy albums.
i mean, i have a yacht, so i obviously did pretty well money wise.
it is just that you say it is going to cost what it costs-- put him through.
yes.
ryan, my man!
yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
okay, yeah, i dunno.
i dunno, i think those it guys messed up.
wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is.
found it.
oh!
um, actually, i need the car.
use to have two cars, traded  them in, now we are down to one.
good economic sense.
although the new car is a porsche.
for her.
you can not, i have a thing tonight.
what?
oh no, i have a thing tonight.
how about this weekend?
dammit to hell.
i-i-ugh, ok. all right.
you would not understand.
it is a secret.
I am sorry mr. of'brian, i did not mean to interrupt your dinner.
i just have a very exciting offer.
my records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight.
well, what if i told you that i have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes?
how does that sound?
amazing right?
well, it will not be that fast, but it will-- it will be that easy.
i just love sales.
i love it to death.
it is as simple as that.
and i do not get to do it enough as a manager, so i took this second job.
i count it as a hobby.
some people have golf, or relaxing.
hey, i just got off the phone, and i was going to make another call.
no, they are with me, so... this is nick figaro, manager to the stars!
these meetings are useless.
very inspirational.
or a trained seal.
yes, is mr. hudson there?
I am just calling because you responded positively to the-- ...stanley?
senor, are you happy with your-- have you-- have you considered satellite television?
well your son sounds like he is really motivated.
i think it is crazy the coach will not play him frankly.
you bet.
look, i know sales, and i had that sale, i just needed a few more minutes-- it is not a waste of our time.
vikram does not have my people skills.
well, i hope this conversation has helped.
what did you get tonight?
oh, that looks good.
i am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
thank you.
really?
wonder what i would have been back home?
i know, but it is competitive here.
what is a dollar worth in your land?
medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
i would have been chief of surgery... or a cowboy.
you know what, here is the thing about die hard 4. die hard one, the original, john mcclane was just this normal guy.
you know, he is just a normal new york city cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up.
but he is an everyday guy.
in die hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter.
in air.
you know?
he is invincible.
it just sort of lost what die hard was.
it is not terminator.
i actually wrote a movie.
I am writing one, yeah.
um, sort of a spy, thriller... thanks, no, i have work tomorrow morning.
okay, see you guys.
hey, how you doing?
okay.
how is yoga?
wh-why not?
okay.
good night vikram.
hey, congrats on the bonus.
I am going to have it one of these nights.
good night.
um... that was not much of an introduction.
ahh, still lame.
okay.
all right.
thank you, ryan, for that wonderful introduction.
okay, um, today we are going to be talking... about...powerpoint!
powerpoint!
powerpoint!
powerpoint!
yes i forgot about ryan's presentation.
and yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me.
but you know what else would have been nice?
winning the lottery.
and the best way to start is to hit start.
and up comes the toolbar, that is what she said.
what we have to do here is go to run, and then you look up to powerpoint.
and we are in.
we are going to register.
you hit register-- updates are ready.
i should update.
um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
why?
no, i had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
my other boss, mr. figaro.
what i do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
it will not.
okay, honestly, it was unlikely i was going to figure this out anyways.
why do not you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
huh, okay.
it is whoever, not whomever.
no, whomever is never actually right.
not a native speaker.
well it sounds right, but is it?
thank you.
no one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is toby, why do not you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
I have never done this before.
I have never quit anything in my life.
so, you are filming history.
nick, i had a dream last night that i had two full time jobs.
one here at the lipophedrazone diet pill company-- and the other i was a regional manager of a small paper supply company called dunder mifflin.
in this dream i did both of these jobs beautifully, and i loved it, and everybody loved me.
but the truth is, i can not do this.
i am.
i was never in this for the money.
but it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.
i tried to live the dream.
i tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and i failed.
but the good thing about the american dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
hey kevin, you are a gambler right?
a rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
yeah, i was thinking about doing some gambling myself.
you know, just a little bit of money.
maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.
i do not know, kind of just for fun.
i was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.
like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he is tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.
like, who do i call about that?
do you know anybody in the mob?
okay, um, oscar, I am going to need to take another advance on my salary.
hey guys.
what'cha talking about?
okay, i know what is going on.
you are talking about jim and pam, if they are having sex, what it looks like, i know, i think-- hey, hey, hey.
monkey problem?
no, I am not having monkey problems.
why would i have monkey problems?
oh, i hate monkeys.
i do not have a second job.
maybe I am having an affair with suzanne summers.
i do not talk to my girlfriend about money.
it is rude, and unsexual.
i totally agree with you.
but i do not have money problems, i do not.
alright, you know what?
watch this, if i had money problems, would i do this?
yeah, but i destroyed it, it is not even useable anymore.
no you did not.
how would that help creed?
in monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
that is a good point.
like the witness protection program.
I have always wanted to be in the witness protection program.
fresh start, no debts, no baggage.
I have already got my name picked out, lord rupert everton.
I am a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.
that is the life.
i... declare... bankruptcy!
i did not say it, i declared it.
yeah, tell me about it.
you know, jan has my credit cards, and she is using them as if I am made of money, she thinks I am a human atm machine.
oh, that is the muppet show, on dvd, classic.
that is by far the best way to strengthen your core.
this machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.
it strengthens your entire core.
your back core, your arm core, the marine core actually uses it.
i think that is how they got a core.
mm-hm.
that is so cool how you have my name at the top.
right.
how do they do this so fast?
is this power-point?
no, no, we are going to leave jan out of this.
we will find another way, we will ask power-point.
you are a presentation tool if you think I am going to tell jan about this.
no you are not!
ok, just... you are not a tool.
look, we will tell her that it is bad, but it could have been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work i was able to cut it in half.
she poses.
um, that is, how did you get that from what oscar's saying?
what am i doing?
i am blowing dodge.
I am getting out of town.
whatever you call it, i am running away from my responsibilities.
and it feels good.
runaway train, never come back.
runaway and I am never coming back.
hey january not much, what is up with you?
I am out of answers january i told you, no more answers.
this is who i am now.
a guy on a train with no answers.
i hope that can be enough for you.
i do not know that.
I will stay off the grid.
yeah it is, it is.
i really messed up.
that is really nice of you to say.
i think the engineer left.
do not sell your implants please.
that is nice though.
it looks cute though.
i used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.
they would say things like "do not pay for six months" or "you can transfer your account from another card"... do you think I will get any new ones?
i could... what do you mean, "what"?
were you listening to what i was saying?
what is the matter with you?
yeah.
yeah.
all right, well, go find some.
get outa here, please.
yeah.
what?
um, my cds.
i do.
my cds are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called case logic and, um the case logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.
there is another smaller case logic portfolio clipped to my visor   what?
I have been putting money into cds for years.
i bought music that i did not even like.
no.
i can not.
i can not go back to that.
i do not know if i can do that.
i can not see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
we will?
i can not.
i do not have an idea in my head.
i have... okay.
what?
um... tell me.
well, please?
i will not tell anybody.
yeah, i will.
yeah!
everything!
oh it is all good, it is all good.
phyllis!
dancing babies!
i love it!
i love it!
we are making a commercial for dunder mifflin today.
our first ad ever.
corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about dunder mifflin infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it is uh, not too shabby.
okay, it is football cream.
it is football cream.
alright!
so, anybody else?
look at that.
even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity.
very good, very good.
hello hello!
michael scott.
regional manager.
excited to talk ideas.
you know, i want this to be cutting edge.
i want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a mtv on crack kind of thing.
all right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
i would like you to meet andrew bernard.
the 'nard dog.
who let the 'nard dog out?
he gives the best back rubs in the office.
now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
stanley is hilarious.
phyllis is like our mrs. butterworth.
kind of a less urban aunt jemima.
these are our accountants.
and as you can see they are very different sizes.
what you might want to do is kind of a papa bear, mama bear, baby bear thing.
that might be kind of fun.
who else?
little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she is in the desert and the field is an oasis.
zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel.
zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison.
but we zoom back further-- actually i do not get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, i get paid by the year, so... yeah, i know.
mmm.
okay.
that is what nassau came up with?
that sucks!
whoa.
well we can do better than that.
the waving?
shrek!
shrek, I am a donkey!
I am a donkey, shrek!
I am just kidding.
it is me.
hello ry.
okay, calm down.
i have a small problem.
yeah, well when i call about big problems you do not like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo.
here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
I am creative, ryan.
well actually i can not cook, and i am starting a restaurant.
mike's cereal shack.
I am thinking we will have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
yeah!
are you?
i do not think you are doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
all right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative.
when i was five, i imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn.
and this is before i had even heard of one, or seen one.
i just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head.
and i was five, five years old.
could not even talk yet.
hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
how about never hundred hours, sir.
hey thanks.
thank you.
yeah, I am glad you called.
ryan is being a little bitch again.
what is up my brotha?
listen, david, i would like to do this ad in house.
i want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office.
and i will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it is ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we will do it on my dime.
I am willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
okay.
and thus, michael scott sealed his own destiny.
in a good way.
has anyone ever come up to you and said, "you are not creative"?
well they are wrong.
you are creative.
you are damn creative.
each and every one of you.
you are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
we have three scenes to film, big scenes.
we have a song to write.
so let us get cracking.
kelly, i want you to do makeup.
oscar, i would like you to do costume design, obviously.
phyllis, I would like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.
okay, okay, phyllis this is what i want you to do.
i want you to go down to the mall.
i want you to get in line.
i want you to get her to be in this commercial.
this would be a huge coupe people.
all right?
do not take no for an answer.
line it up phyllis.
time out, time out, time out, time out, time out.
i thought... i was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
okay, darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture.
I will make you a mix.
stop.
stop stop stop stop stop stop.
this is not me.
this is not my music.
no, i hate it!
i hate it!
...i do not hate it, i just do not like it at all.
and it is terrible.
okay, you know what.
hold on, hold on darryl.
no.
i said i hate the, the style.
okay, wow.
wow, this looks uh, terrible.
andy, andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad.
and if we do not get this, if we do not nail it, we are going to lose the whole triumph of the moment.
the triumph of the will.
now, god, what?
what phyllis?
that'a girl.
did you, or did you not get sue grafton?
ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?
I am about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent.
they will probably watch it right away.
i know i would.
okay.
pam, please clear my phone lines.
they could call at any second now.
oh god...i better call.
well, it is been tough.
the uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version.
so welcome one and all to the world premiere of corporate crapfest!
no, it was stupid.
people like waving, waving sells.
it is not art.
yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
that was fun.
next round of drinks is on me, people!
all right!
so, anybody else?
no bad ideas.
everybody, let us keep  them coming... oh, god.
okay, toby?
there are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.
and that is probably why most ads suck.
oh, that is them!
those are the ad guys right there.
all right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and i will let you know when it is time to film.
pam!
pam, come here for a second.
did you get the memo about dressing your best?
about dressing your best today?
cool.
cool, i just wanted to make sure you got it.
okay, good.
good.
this is pam beesly, representing our girl next door.
pretty but nothing special.
you know, but she sort of keeps it real.
what you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her.
might be good.
who else?
oh, creed... is the old guy over there.
do not look at him.
you might want to use him to sort of get that orville redenbacher dynamic going.
and if not we can just make him disappear.
this is jim!
halpert.
jim has a very expressive face, do not you jim?
he is like our mr. bean.
so do, um, do sad, do the sad face.
no, that is skeptical.
do sad.
that is, that is a pirate movie.
that is annoyed.
well, he does not do very well under pressure.
and anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.
follow me!
let us get this movin'.
all right, let us start.
you are my producer, you are a suit.
i am the creative genius.
you take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.
now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a sam goody gift certificate... ...and we need to be done by 9 a.m. tomorrow.
we start on a single blank sheet of paper.
and we widen to reveal ancient rome.
okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.
bull man!
this is bull!
ahhhh!
if you do not let me pursue my artistic vision, i am going to walk!
no!
no!
jim, jim, do not, do not... no, i can do it.
i can do it good.
i can do it good.
please, do not.
please.
please give me it.
do you want this open or closed?
hey, everybody, i just got off the phone with david wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever dunder mifflin television commercial.
huh?
i can not hear you!
heard you a little bit less that time.
must be... okay, okay.
who could do music?
actually, I am a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano.
this is perfect.
this is a dummy, a la ferris bueller's day off.
we have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.
when somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.
now nobody knows whether i am here, or whether i am gone.
but, you will not tell anyone.
well, sometimes.
most of the time i will be with ryan, or darryl.
yes?
oh good, good stanley!
first victim, this is what i want you to do.
go out, come back in.
we are going to hide.
i want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
just go out, and come back in.
what?
hey everyone, can i have your attention please?
i just thought you all should know that stanley hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend karen from utica is going to give him more money to work there.
no, no, no, no, no-no, no no.
you completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.
clearly, karen is trying to get back at us because jim dumped her.
okay, smarty pants, then why?
why is she trying to take stanley from us?
that could not possibly be it.
you cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.
stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.
the bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.
i do not know how george bush did it when colin powell left, and if utica thinks that they are going to poach stanley, they have another thing coming.
how can i get you to stay?
yeah we all want money.
but there is none in the budget, so... tell me why you are really leaving.
mo money mo problems, stanley.
you of all people should know that.
let me ask you this, if i were- pssh, kay.
fillipellers, how is it hanging?
to the left?
to the right?
okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
yes, listen, um...  you cannot tear stanley from his family like this.
no, his work family.
look, this is very hard for me, but I am going to give you my best man.
you may have toby.
you can train him.
he is very very smart, and funny, and charming... you know, i can not do it, toby is the worst.
that- that was a bluff, um...  listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I am going to poach one of yours.
okay, good-bye.
wait!
wait!
karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?
your best one?
hi ben, michael scott.
I am going to cut right to the chase here.
do you like magic?
because I am a genie in a bottle, and I am going to grant you three wishes.
to move to scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
get out.
uh, yeah.
i also saved her life, but i guess that is not as grabby.
no, i fired them, and your next.
... so what do you say?
what is that guy talking about?
scranton is not lame.
scranton is the cool, fun branch.
we are like animal house.
jim, we are getting crapped on.
word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
what are we going to do?
we are going to make a monster sale, that is what we are going to do.
corcroan dropped staples.
yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.
you, me, dwight are going to jump into my pt cruiser, and we are going to crush this sale.
we are going to prove, what the hell is that music?
that is the problem, that is the problem.
we need rock n' roll pam, rock n' roll.
alright?
oh... my... god, that is why people are leaving.
i- i have no words.
what?
what?
we did?
look at his face!
look at his face!
what are we doing, dwight, what we are doing?
we are going on a panty raid to utica, is what we are doing.
uh-huh.
yes you are.
oh, buckle up jim.
we are going to make karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
in your face are you calling karen?
yep, get it.
it had to be done, it had to be done.
hey dwight, he found it.
alright, you are going to miss the best prank ever.
do you really want to know?
follow me, come here.
here is what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.
i brought silly string, dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
no, no, not real bombs.
uh, maybe, maybe, i do not know.
it could be badass.
yeah, it will.
teach her to offer stanley more money.
so, why did you and karen break up?
was it the sex?
i can not imagine the sex being bad, i mean her body is... ...awesome.
okay, i will start.
um, "a."  "a" my name is alan, and my wife's name is alice, we live in alaska, and we sell...  damn it!
what do we sell?
um... I am trying to think of what we could sell.
ah, la, la, la.
what is that?
that sound...  the air-conditioning leaking or something?
what is that?
dwight, are you peeing?
come on man, that is disgusting dwight!
I will kill you man!
that is just so disgusting!
afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
yeah, dwight, here is how it is going to go down.
you and i- you and i are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.
and then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
we are in a stairwell.
there is a guy, there is a guy.
oh my god, oh my god, that was very close.
we found something far better, their crown jewel.
their industrial copier.
it is enormous, but it is got wheels.
we are wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.
get the car ready, keep the engine running.
aha!
we are wedged between the copier and the railing.
ah!
ow!
ow, my leg!
jim leave us.
save yourself!
dwight, you got to move!
dwight, could you move over a little bit.
take her to a motel, make love to her jim.
just say you want to get back together.
it does not have to mean anything.
just, do it for stanley.
come on jim, just climb on top of her and think about stanley.
ah, jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the dundies.
dwight.
granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.
and if you so much as harm a hair on stanley's head, we will burn utica to the ground.
we tried and we failed.
stanley, you may go.
here is a box, for your things, but i doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.
fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.
pam, I am going to need some help writing a want ad.
um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass.
big butt, bigger heart.
i can not do this.
of course.
really?
utica is snoozeville, um, albany are the prepsters, nashua, no parking, um, akron is haunted, camden... is in a basement, yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in scranton, we are the cool guys.
woo!
shotgun!
yes, i am, but i want shotgun for you.
no, dwight!
dwight, jim is sitting next to me.
you are going to sit in the back left  where i do not have to see your ugly moongob.
I am sorry.
I am sorry.
dwight, you are handsome.
you are a very handsome man, get in the car.
dwight!
stop it!
can you help me please, I am being crushed.
would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?
like i begged you to?
pam would have understood.
heck, pam would have done it.
you embarrassed us.
morning.
hey, nobody cares.
nobody cares.
i need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
hypothetically, if i were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means?
not real.
so if i were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
really?
oh, you want to go today?
how often can you actually donate blood?
your body only has a certain amount.
yeah, just this whole toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
a bunch of guys, in a tent?
making s'mores?
hello, I am broken mountain.
you know, here is the thing.
that is not how you go camping.
i think you go camping by yourself-- in the wilderness.
it is not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents.
it is one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
i want to do it myself.
you know, i want to go and, and find out something about myself, i want to get outta here.
all the cliques, and the office politics.
fluorescent lights.
asbestos.
I am sick of it jim.
I am sick of this place.
when jan and i had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called "survivorman." and, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
ok, i will only need two things.
roll of duct tape and a knife.
ok. thirty minutes or less, please come back.
save the receipts.
hey, what... hey, hey hey!
dwight.
.
dwight.
dwight and i are going out.
he will return later, but i will not.
i will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
no.
dwight will be driving me deep into the pennsylvania wilderness.
where he will then leave me to either die or to survive.
the choice is yours.
yes, and i am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days.
do not try to follow me.
this is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that i wish to share it with me, myself and i. when i return, i hope to be a completely changed human being.
this is what a true survivor man does.
you simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck.
you could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets.
now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer.
creepy guy who is abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
well, yes i would.
and i would survive.
well... you... you... you are as creepy as a real serial killer.
for real.
ok. i am putting this on so i have no familiarity with my surroundings.
now this way, i can not retrace my steps.
i do not know what streets we have been--  ow!
what are you doing?
no!
gosh!
dwight.
stop it, stop it!
stop it.
just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
look at those wrinkles.
blacks do crack!
not crack the drug.
happy birthday!
happy birthday!
happy birthday!
dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest.
just the two of us from this point out.
what are you doing?
stop.
dwight, dwight.
just -- stop.
alright, good.
thank you, dwight.
alright, very good.
ahh, ok. thanks for the ride.
ok. leave me be, dwight.
day one.
I am in the interior of the vast pennsylvania wilderness.
I have brought with me only the bare essentials.
a knife, roll of duct tape, in case i need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel.
it is hot today.
the sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about  2 of the clock in the afternoon.
it is really beating down on me now.
i think that i want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources.
ok. oh, there we go.
watch that i do not hit my corroded artery here... there we go.
much better.
now everything i brought with me can be used.
my sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .
I am going to wear what was once one of my pant legs.
see, this is a beautiful piece of material  this could be used for all sorts of things.
some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
i am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts.
i love it.
I am loving it.
i can literally say anything i want.
no one is going to here me.
wish i could have gone with ryan on that cool retreat!
jan has plastic boobs!
i have hemorrhoids!
does not even matter.
well it is a little chillier than i had thought, so i have fashioned my hat back into my pants.
several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment.
now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life.
things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.
i have made this spear, with which i will impale my dinner.
and it could not come a moment too soon because i have been without food for a good three hours or so.
I am startin' to feel it a little bit.
ohh... it is creed's birthday.
happy birthday to you.
happy birthday to you.
happy birthday to creed.
happy birthday to you.
happy birthday, buddy.
well if you take a look at this, i tented my pants.
I have made myself a nice pants tent shelter.
and this little guy  may be dunder mifflin paper some day.
under this tree, i think i struck the mother load.
those  are nature's best mushrooms.
wild, and i have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well.
yeah!
alright, skip around the room.
skip around the room.
we want -- ok, alright.
yeah, do not do that.
you are going to break something.
man became civilized for a reason.
he decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day.
he did not want to have to struggle to survive.
i do not need the woods.
i have a nice wood desk.
i do not need fresh  air, because i have the freshest air around, a.c. and i do not need wide open spaces.
check it out.
i can also make it the sky.
hey, buddy.
what up?
you are relieved.
so what did i miss?
oh.
yeah, okay, i did that.
rookie mistake.
uh huh.
yeah, just wait.
ten years, you will figure it out.
that is what i said.
that is what she said.
i never know.
i just say it.
i say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension.
when things sort of get hard.
hey!
nice.
really good.
bravo, my young ward.
come in!
pam, are you my friend?
we have been friends forever, right?
hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if i were to ask you?
and bear in mind that i would never actually ask you to go camping.
that jim is also a friend of mine, and i would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.
do you understand that jim is like a brother to me, and i would never do anything inappropriate?
so, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?
thank you for your honesty.
split the difference.
hey... mint chocolate chip, please?
is jim out there?
can you send dwight in here?
mmhmm.
i had something very personal i would like to discuss.
would you go find jim, and send him in here, please?
okay.
all right, dexter, just give me the knife.
no, just get me a case.
all right.
mmmmm.
all i need... no, dwight!
I am telling you, all i will need are my instincts and my will to survive.
what is this called again?
nobody likes to work late, least of all me.
do you have plans tonight?
yes i remember.
mmm, this is b.s.
this is b.s.
why are we here?
i am going to call corporate.
enough is enough, I am - god, I am so mad!
this is michael scott, scranton, well we do not want to work.
no we do not!
it is not fair to these people.
these people are my friends and i care about them!
we are not going to do it!
everybody i just got off the horn with corporate and basically i told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment.
go enjoy your friday.
all right, happy friday.
well i think we dodged a bullet there.
i think we should celebrate.
how about you, pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
you said you did not have plans.
that is what you said.
dwight, it is couples only.
and besides, i only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and jan, and pam and jim, and angela and andy.
hello.
come on in.
good to see you.
yes i would.
so, what have you been doing?
yeah.
well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
except driving.
well have a seat, or come on in, or, i do not know, make yourself to home.
this is our casa.
okay.
totally your call babe.
oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
well, that is... yep, never been used.
no.
this is it, check that out, can you smell that?
as you can smell there is a lot of different odors going on in here.
bond.
james bond fire.
i am bond fire, james bond fire.
michael scarn.
guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
well, i- thanks, that is my bed.
jan has some space issues, so i curl up on that puppy.
it is actually a lot bigger than it seems.
look at this.
i finally broke down and bought myself a plasma tv.
check it out.
i actually hung this on the wall myself.
i want to show you something .
a lot of people in the room, need more space?
voila, right in the wall.
sometimes i will just stand here and watch television for hours.
i love it, i love this tv.
oh and i also built this table.
no, i think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
if you ever need any help, i am just a phone call away.
oh honey, i have the best trophy right here, aside from my dundies.
I will get it.
okay.
very nice.
when in rome.
whatever you say babe.
all right.
how 'bout a toast.
shall i?
here is to good friends.
kind of sorta an oaky afterbirth.
yeah that sounds good.
you know what, hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why ryan fired him.
all right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
yes, i was watching jim's face.
and he was laughing.
look at him, he is laughing.
well you do not need two of you to do that.
that is true, that is a great point.
come on down here.
sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
all right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready.
all right first name is tom- all right, okay, okay, you are getting inside my head.
first name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a caribbean cruise.
no, baah!
but he is married to her!
no!
it has to be a real person jim, come on.
okay, no no, I am going to pass, I am going to pass.
okay, rhymes with parnold schporzenegger.
okay, he is the governor of california, he is the terminator.
no!
god, does anybody read the paper?!
you are welcome.
i do not like that story babe.
stop, stop it!
i mean, i like ice cream.
okay?
sue me.
oh, no, do not.
i should not say that jokingly because she will sue me.
she loves to sue, loves lawsuits.
you know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
ha ha, you are!
she is!
she is the devil!
I am in hell!
aaahhh I am burning, help me!
so i spend most of my time right here.
have a hand .
so jim i noticed you checking out jan's candles.
yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market?
$2 billion dollar a year industry.
and for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "serenity by jan" what do you think about that?
I am sorry.
what now?
dwight is my friend.
you said that i could not invite dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we did not have enough wine glasses.
dwight brought glasses and a person.
whatever i want?
it is never whatever i want.
when i wanted to see stomp, and you wanted to see wicked, what did we see?
when i said that i wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did i do?
and then when you said that you might want to have kids and i was not so sure, who had the vasectomy reversed?
and then when you said you defintely did not want to have kids, who had it reversed back?
snip snap!
snip snap!
snip snap!
i did.
you have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person.
and i bought this condo to fill with children.
do you mean it?
you want to have a kid?
pam... i hope she did not do anything to the food.
i can not prove it but i think she might be trying to poison me.
hey, looks great babe.
you know i have soft teeth, how can you say that?
excuse me for a second.
ok... alright... here we go.
there.
oooookay.
everybody enjoying their meal?
yeah?
no.
no.
I am going to leave it up.
i think it ties the whole room together.
jan thinks hunter is very talented.
you know what?
i do not think he is that good.
bfd.
I am a screenwriter.
no all you do is you get me to try to work on my rich friends!
man!
i would love to burn your candles!
oh good.
I will be your first customer!
that is what she said!
that is a 200 dollar plasma screen tv you just killed!
good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!
you know what guys, she will be out of the bathroom soon.
nope.
nope.
nothing disturbing here.
just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
oh... yes.
there was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my tv.
plasma.
would she get into trouble?
i will take the fall.
i did it.
jim?
pam?
no.
nope.
my ideals at a party?
easy.
jim.
pam.
ryan.
the mayor.
barack obama.
shiloh jolie-pitt.
because at the end of the night, brad or angelina would have to come and pick him up and i would get to meet them.
shia la beef because of disturbia.
umm, all of the children of the world.
val kilmer.
but he probably would not come, too famous.
obviously george clooney.
umm... and jan definitely, if there was room.
yes, i did, for you, princess.
even though i only went number one.
i did not really wash my hands.
ohhh, what have we here?
this looks delicious.
they need to be presented... royally... anyone?
good stuff.
all right.
let us get down to some wine drinking.
it is been a rough couple of weeks.
little trouble.
yes.
well, jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
yes.
so she is passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog... and the neighbors blamed january it is like, you know, the dog should not have been outside in the first place.
anyway, it is a tragedy, really, because the paint is not going to come off the dog until it sheds... so... well.
pam, when i first opened this catalog, i thought i was just going to be picking out a chair.
have you ever seen this woman?
hmm... look at her smile.
those eyes, look at her eyes.
she is got - i do not know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women?
i think what i meant was that i was completely swearing off one woman.
january i think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
what is it like being single?
i like it.
i like starting each day with a sense of possibility.
and I am optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. i am ready to start dating again.
getting back on the market.
so, fyi, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template.
that will be all.
listen man, i am completely over jan, so, would you set me up?
i thought that you were engaged?
whaaaat?
god, that is terrible man.
eghh, she is crazy.
umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
oh... yeah... ugh.
she is...  you do not deserve her.
alright.
oh hello oscar mayer weiner lover.
i bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you would never touch  them, because of your condition.
umm... what?
oh.
hmm, i see, feisty.
so she is not jolly or sassy?
not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
oooo.
catcher or in field?
is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer?
could we share a row boat?
could, could a row boat support her?
i think I am being very clear what I am asking.
would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?
it bothers me that you are not answering the question.
damn it, i knew it!
i knew it phyllis!
ok!
what is wrong with these people?
i would do anything for them and they are just hanging me out to dry.
dating should not be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why?
because nobody here is willing to help me.
nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it?
well, fine.
here goes.
well, now ok, i know that this is probably not appropriate, but i need help.
because i want to play ball with my kids before i get too old.
and before that happens i need to get laid.
and before that happens i need to be in love.
and i do not want to hear "ahnnn... i can not help elhh la la." no.
no.
I am a catch and i am not going to be the one who got away.
so, this is what we are going to do.
dwight is going to hand out index cards and i want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day.
no, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
hmm.. well, look, i am in an assigned parking place in front, so... alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.
ok, yes that would be bad.
that would be bad.
wish i could, but i can not.
well can, but will not.
should, maybe, but shorn't.
what part of shorn't do not you understand, kevin?
look i could probably handle it, yes, but i think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
oh you can not because i do not care.
listen,  do not forget to fill out those cards.
my love cards.
ok, wendy.
hot and juicy red head.
give this a try.
hello wendy, this is kevin's friend, michael.
oh, I am sorry, could you put her on please?
damn it kevin.
ok, umm, could i just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
well, I will send somebody to come pick it up.
just have it ready.
well put it aside.
umm... yeah.
good.
good because this batch was awful.
umm... this one says chair model... that sounds good.
go get her.
wa-wait, wait, wait, wait.
first, go to wendy's, get my food.
come back and then go.
she is dead?
she is so young.
oh, god.
oh... try not to be so hurtful jim.
please, not at a time like this.
oh really?
what is her name?
burger king?
i do not, i do not think I am ready.
is she hot?
no question about it, i am ready to get hurt again.
no, not the five families.
sorry, i do not have time for this right now.
I am trying to get a date with pam's hot friend.
and she needs to meet me right now.
thank you very much.
our suspect has straight brown hair.
she is wearing blue jeans and a black top.
so... behold our bachelorette .
give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself.
hello, my lady.
ugh.
is who a michael what?
oh, that is not, yeah I am not... ok... so you get the rent checks every month and what happens next?
what... just making conversation.
why is it so hard to meet people?
i... you know... it is uh... all i want is somebody nice and sweet and someone i can talk to and share an experience with, you know?
why is it so hard for people like us?
you want to see what i walked out on?
this is going to blow your mind.
look at that.
yeah.
yeah, and you can not see her whole body.
down here, she is got a boob job.
just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and i do not know.
oh, ok. well, umm... i enjoyed this conversation.
it was very nice.
it was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
now you ruined it.
margaret the land lady?
really pam, is that what you think of me?
oh, ok, well I am looking for a passionate affair, not companionship.
I am a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately.
god... i do not know man.
i was with jan for so long.
i was excited about meeting somebody new.
put my heart out there.
it is just... you are right.
what do you mean though?
hmm.
how did she die?
god.
she was so innocent.
you know i used to think that i had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that is just silly because she is dead.
what do you do?
oh, you move on.
bye, bye, ms. chair model lady.
i dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice.
we had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why did you have to go off and die?
why did you have to go off  and die?
return.
this'll be  the day that i died.
it is moving day.
i have spent the last month here at dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after jan and i, um  ssp... no, i did not kill her.
we were just at different places in our lives.
no, i thought I would be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo.
she has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in scottsdale.
fresh outlook, and it is all good.
oh.
what is this?
you were charging me?
I am your friend.
there was no other guest the entire time i was here.
okay.
all right, dwight.
take my money.
go ahead.
keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.
the late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.
just ring me up.
go ahead .
thank you, dwight.
dwight, little help with the bags, please.
so, what about you, angela?
do you have any single friends?
a cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or... no, no, obviously older.
love.
marriage.
baby carriage.
those have been my goals ever since i heard that song.
jan and i had love.
we did not have marriage.
we did have a baby carriage, which i got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a dui.
hey, kelly.
nothing.
just hangin'.
chillin'.
no agenda.
would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?
yeah?
that is hilarious.
what is her number?
mmm... nah, that is too young.
oh.
all right, time's up!
pencils down.
please pass your future mrs. michael scotts forward.
pammy?
you do not have one single girlfriend?
I am not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with.
just fun, healthy young woman.
a kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?
how 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?
you know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it does not have to be a model.
I am not, do not rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.
there is face models, hand models, body models  - yes.
really?
no, i am, it is all about the personality, jim.
send me a picture.
so far, these are my leads.
a blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.
it is a start.
i got gum in my hair.
this just stinks.
do not touch it, please do not touch it.
ok, let me be.
i was walking in and i noticed something shinny under stanley's car and i got under to see what it was and i messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
kill me... right now.
i do not feel like peanut butter.
get me an ice cream sandwich.
hey, hey, hey.
this is my hair we are talking about.
smells good.
oh do not.
that is disgusting.
well just do not leave it on too long.
keep massaging please.
ah yeah, that is nice.
i will be honest; the dating has not been going well.
look, men are visual creatures.
we crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of cindy crawford nude... that, but the women I am getting fixed up with are, egh!
not that they are not nice, or that have great personalities, they just... they just lack a certain... crawfordness.
ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention please.
i know that a lot of you are very angry with ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, i swear to god, if any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or... yeah.
ryan has done a very good job, and i am not applauding sarcastically.
think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen.
but now, at a time tdb, all of the problems will be in the past.
ya done good kid, ya done good.
well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
oh ryan, i need a girlfriend so bad.
argh.
alright.
do you know any girls in new york you might want to hook me up with?
some that might be interested in a guy like me.
na?
well you tried.
yeah.
they sound great.
would you have sex with meredith?
do you think she would keep it quiet?
jim, it is not the horniness, ok it is the loneliness that... let us go to new york.
we will go clubbing with ryan.
yes you can, you are single, I am single.
it will be awesome.
who you dating?
that is still going on?
ok, dwight grab your stuff, we are going to new york to party with ryan and to meet girls.
sorry andy.
cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight.
let us go.
everybody, i will see you tomorrow, saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that i am wearing right now, if you catch my drift.
i am going to go get laid.
goodbye.
that is... i, i think that... ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening.
it is called prerogative.
place is packed.
packed with beautiful babies.
swingers.
classic.
john favreau, tall guy from dodgeball.
no, they are just hotties.
hey.
hey!
well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
alright!
yeah.
ryan, it is michael and dwight.
ok. well.
alright!
let us do it!
hey, nice to meet you.
oh ok, all i know is i would like some chicken fingers and a midori sour.
oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
i umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point.
i was thinking about getting "back to the future."  "back" because it is on my back and "future" because I am the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future.
i just think a tattoo should mean something, you know?
and it is my second favorite movie.
back to the future?
oh, wow.
well you should take a, a film education course.
forty... I am in my forties.
nuhh... oh, ok. you are welcome.
this place is like sexy pre-school.
i would love a place where we could meet older <i>girls</i>.
ahh, wow.
that is dangerous.
you are kidding.
I have never met anyone who does that.
you wash dogs?
very cool.
i am a bank teller.
ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.
i think so.
yeah, i have fun.
all right.
very perfect.
oh my  this needs to be shared.
she washes dogs.
i know.
i do not want to get ahead of myself, but i think i want her to meet my mom.
yeah, maybe.
hmm... i am.
i am getting out there.
well, no I have asked a lot of girls to dance mom.
they are just, it is not...  yes, i shaved above my neck.
oh my god, mom, i got to go.
one of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.
those girls really wailed on you bad.
well... pretty weird.
let us go.
i know, here we go.
this is it.
this is where the magic happens.
very nice.
dwight, I am the boss.
case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, i do not wannna get my head stepped on.
dwight, shh shh.
dwight.
leave him alone.
shh.
ryan, ryan, we are going to take your clothes off.
shh, just stop.
here is what you do.
you tell him that you are his friend and that you are going to help him and that everyone is going to be all right.
and then you put a wire on him and you find out who is selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch.
you follow that guy to the people who is really really bad.
been watching the wire recently.
i do not understand a word of it.
best night ever.
like i said, it is not about the horniness, it is about the loneliness.
and how can i be lonely with my boys?
like a famous person once said, boys on the side.
but i do not, i disagree, i say... let us hear it for the boys.
you are going to be okay, it is going to... ahh, ooh!
come on, come on.
here we go, let us sit down.
all right, shhh.
dwight, leave him alone.
you had a rough night tonight.
but your life is very good, my friend.
you have got a great job, you... you can have any woman you want, you are good looking, you, you know... frien..sss...yes, you are friends with a hobbit, and... look where you live.
i mean, you have got it all.
no, i mean this apartment building, it is fantastic.
well, now i can say that i went to a museum.
ryan?
do you ever miss us?
ryan?
do you remember what color my eyes are?
dwight, i asked him.
really?
not just because he said it?
ryan?
everybody!
everybody!
listen up, i need your ideas, now!
ideas please, right now!
go!
go!
come on!
wet cement, outside.
it is drying fast, come on.
this is a lifelong dream.
what do i write?
what do i write?
m.g.s.?
no.
some idiot named mark greg sputnik will claim credit for it.
i do not... once in a lifetime opportunity people!
come on, here we go!
here we go!
let us, yes?
okay... okay, do it!
go on!
great!
let us hear it!
it is drying, it is drying... alright, hablbelah, come on, phyl!
ahh come on!
no!
no!
no!!
come on, give me something good!
pam, translate.
i love it!
i love it more!
i... love it!!
haha, come on!
hurry, please.
that is what she said.
today is a very special day for me.
and it is really not about me, it is about my grandkids, it is about my great grandkids... i can come back here when I am 100, and i can find that piece of cement and say, "that is me.
look kids, your daddy left that face hole..." i dunno, it is a good feeling.
all right, everybody... oh my god, pam, those make you look so ugly.
um, pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off.
you are moving in the wrong direction... ub, dub dah, do not need, i can not even hear you.
it is just noise coming out of an ugly scientist.
um, everybody, we are going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
ener-gize... everybody, so how are we going to energize our office?
i mean, i have not done anything since christmas.
pam, clearly, has just given up trying.
so what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit.
anybody have any ideas of what we could do.
any suggestions?
yes, andy?
zing and pep, see that is those are the kind of words we are looking for.
yes, jim?
now we are cooking.
i like this.
maybe a whole theme, like a rap.
a rap rhyme... an urban, yeah, stanley?
you want to help us out with that?... stanley, earth to stanley... yes you.
come on, stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
stanley, we are havin a little... we are havin a little brainstorm session... ...good, this is good.
I am going to grab a glass of water.
ugh, what?
what are you blabbering about?
nothing happened.
that?
in the conference room?
we were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did i stutter," and i said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" it was joking, toby, alright?
well you do not get it, because stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you are... you.
if you had any friends, you would understand.
friends joke with one another: "hey um, you are poor." "well hey, you are mama's dead." that is what friends do.
it is... you are so white.
mmhmm.
okay, i will... I am not feeling very well right now though.
my stomach hurts, so i may be going home early today, but... well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it is probably psychological.
i, uh, see that you... gave me that form that i asked you to give me, stanley the manly, so thank you for that.
i guess we are back to normal.
well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you did not mean, um, and that i forgive you for.
the whole thing's silly, is not it?
friends do not need to apologize to friends as far as I am concerned, so we are cool.
uh huh... great what is the pink?
ok... is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
other than me.
i never said you could do that.
i... okay, i will think about it.
no.
hey.
darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?
it is an advice question, and if you do not want to talk about it, i completely understand.
it is, um... i know, it is very, very personal... i knew it.
okay, who we talking about here?
crips?
bloods?
god.
okay.
okay, so dig this: you are on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
what is that?
really?
i would have never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
okay, everybody, shh!
so, earlier today, stanley sassed me, and toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him.
they did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so i am now going to fake fire him.
it is like a mock execution.
yes it is a good idea.
it is the only possible solution i have left.
no, okay... I have had enough of you.
because i want you to behave as if I am actually firing him, oscar, okay?
I am not firing him.
I am not, i need you to act like i am firing him.
just, what I am going to do, is I am going to pretend that i am firing him, and i need you to act like i am firing him.
do you get that?
do you get it?
I am teaching him a lesson.
he needs to learn humility, alright?
that is all I am, okay, here he comes.
let us just... play act.
stanley, may i talk to you for a second?
stanley hudson, you are fired.
i am serious, we are all serious.
you are fired like a heart attack.
hmm.
alright alright, okay, you know what?
now you know how i feel.
this was a fake firing.
lesson learned.
good work, everybody.
very nice.
that is it.
and uh... do you have anything to say to me?
okay... yes.
that is not- all right, all right... okay.
hey, stop it!
okay, everybody out.
everybody, except stanley.
i do not understand why you keep picking on me.
you just, do, and i do not know why, so... please help me understand.
well stanley, maybe you are feeling that you do not respect me because you do not know me very well.
all right, you do not respect me.
i accept that.
but listen to me, you can not talk to me that way in this office, you just can not.
i am your boss.
can not allow it.
i am good person, and sometimes, good people do not get no respect.
rodney dangerfield.
hey, i do not get no respect.
no respect at all.
when i was in the sandbox as a kid, i got not respect.
my wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, "i do not respect you!" ahh, thoughtless.
aw, you know what do not get no respect?
airplane food.
why do not they just make the plane out of the airline food?
my wife do not get no respect, some-take her, please, for example.
if you do not get no respect, you might be redneck.
respect is niiice.
borat.
what is the deal with grapenuts?
no grapes, no nuts.
i do not get no respect!
so I am thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live.
and then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling.
it is a summer christmas sale-abration.
and we call it, a summer sales-a-lot.
feedback?
anybody?
stanley?
dammit, phyllis.
alright, everybody out except phyllis.
you know, i do not care what he did to me.
he is mean to other people, that is what gets me.
he is just... everybody.
he just, he is always, he is always talking about people behind their backs to me.
like that people are stupid, and that they are idiots, and that they are sluts.
because he is mean.
he is, he is like a really mean-spirited guy.
he talks about how gay oscar is... and that angela's a midget, and that  your chin is too big.
i know, i know.
i think it is tiny.
i think it is too small if anything.
and that your glasses make you look ugly.
well, he is just mean.
it is complicated, pam.
i mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.
okay.
i put stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.
but sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.
i... jerks do not deserve to be on pedestals.
jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.
big marble... jerk stand.
pam, stand up.
pretty disgusting.
hey.
ready?
come on, show me excited!
yeah, I am pretty excited too.
today I am heading over to the job fair at valley view high school, to find some new interns.
want to get some fresh blood.
um, euthanize this place.
yup.
why are you dressed like that?
like you are applying for a loan.
okay, here is what we are going to do: I am going to instruct the kids about management and sales.
oscar will be in charge of accounting.
pam will be eye candy.
no... uh, also, because that is your alma mater.
darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse.
we do not have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely are not going to college.
let us go!
a little over the top, do not you think?
this is all we need.
yes we will see oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities!
conceptual!
all right!
we.
are.
open for business!
hello!
hello.
hi.
can i talk to you for a sec?
excuse me.
hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest." he is totally wrong, pam.
hey.
how you doing?
listen, i do not think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself.
you could do whatever you want to do.
you could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.
maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
oh, no problem.
and he signed!
he put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams.
and he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper.
we need another one, immediately.
are you mental?
i... do not.
and that.
is why.
i need a smart intern.
hello there.
well it is funny that you should ask, because it is really more than a company... dammit, oscar!
yeah, I am trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days.
thank you dateline!
what do you want?
who cares?
I am not there, jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
thank you!
what, what is this?
this is not dunder mifflin paper.
some sort of pendleton crap.
pam-pam-pam-pam-pampampampam!
we are dying here.
i want you to go back to the office and i want you to get the real stuff.
i want you to get ultra white card stock.
yes.
and do not call me shirley.
all of these jobs?
suck.
i would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes.
they suck.
hey!
game over.
just-in time.
just-in case.
what is your last name?
this... just in.
justin polznik!
huh?
justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she is hot!
and you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses.
and that you were the blind one.
he is the most... important thing in my life right now.
i want you to meet my family.
come on.
oscar martinez.
accountant extraordinaire.
this is justin.
this is darryl philbin.
is not he big?
and you already met her, pam beesly, office hottie.
she will "do" you.
no, no.
but she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
come here.
i would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
so, what do you think?
think these guys are nice?
the guys i did not bring are even better.
justin, I am willing to commit right now.
would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at dunder mifflin?
i think, i think you are very special.
no, i did not.
you misconstrued me.
i, uh, hmm.
why do not... hey.
hold down the fort, i have to do something.
excuse me.
if you can hear me, I would like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you.
h&amp;r block?
come on, i mean i do not even know what they do.
frank regan funeral home?
too much formaldehyde!
the air force?
air force is cool.
the refreshments?
bush league!
you know, that is not what you want.
dunder- they,  well, okay i see security is coming so i just want to say, come to dunder mifflin.
dunder mifflin, a great place to work!
anybody?
show of hands, anybody want to intern at dunder mifflin?
we do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment.
anybody?
show of hands?
damn... it.
okay, I am going to wrap it up here.
thank you for your time, and drive safe.
today i did something stupid.
i questioned myself.
and i will never do that again.
because i look at somebody like jim halpert and i think, that guy can do anything he wants to do.
he could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper.
just like me.
yeah, kiss her.
kiss her good.
well, kids today have a very short attention span.
they are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.
and today they are being distracted by the other booths.
hey, there!
michael scott, regional manager, dunder mifflin.
that is a very firm handshake.
ow, ow, aahch!
killing my hand, there.
so, what is your poison?
you like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like... sales is and could be very, very cool.
if you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.
right here.
we have a lot of fun.
this is one of our staff.
this is pam beesly,  receptionist extraordinaire.
check that out, huh?
pretty nice.
she sits there all day.
you get to look at her.
why do not you hold out your hand.
tell me what you feel.
that is called card stock.
that is what you are feeling.
now what you are feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... you are thinking, "am i good enough for this job?
do i have what it takes?"  and i think we both know the answer.
we will find that out together.
you can keep that.
mmm, yeah.
do not fold it, though.
we have the dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it is sexy, it is sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?
the other day, in the parking lot, i actually found a condom.
so.
I have been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?
so, sexy is fun... hey, you know what?
coincidence - i am going to go for a little stroll myself.
are you psyched about the summer?
yeah, me, too.
okay, be my guest.
and do your worst.
hey.
so, i forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this... one other thing i wanted to... ohh...nah.
hey, justin!
wait, you want this kid to be in the air force?
time out.
you think this kid could be a fighter pilot?
okay.
have you given any more thought to dunder mifflin?
well, yeah, but you do not need the brochure.
the brochure is up here  and it is in here.
i think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.
I am right.
today is toby flenderson's last day.
i could not sleep last night.
i came extra-early.
so much energy... there are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and i just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
mornin'.
so here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building.
I am going to set my watch alarm... and... first thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of toby's going away party.
okay.
okay, well, this will not do.
toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special.
in some cultures, when somebody leaves, like new orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets... if the devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
like a beach blowout?
or a toga, toga- toga!
i thought that you might say that.
every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars.
and lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as nana starts to... but, i knew i should be saving it for something, i just did not know what i should be saving it for.
and then i had an awakening.
"michael, buy a motorcycle." so i put the money in my shoe, and then i forgot about it until now.
i want a party that makes me feel like i am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... i want an antigravity machine.
i saw it in a movie.
you drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
phyllis, can you do this?
toby's replacement.
ugh.
wow.
well, we know that toby thinks she will be great.
so, strike one, i hate her already.
why do you hate her?
you know, dwight, sometimes... i do not know, i think you say things just to agree with me.
yeah!
it would!
just have a thought.
have an original thought.
although, i will agree that her head is weird.
you know what we need to do?
we need to sell her an elevator pass.
exactly.
a little old-fashioned hazing.
yeah.
oh, hey, do you still work here?
nah.
no.
i think i will pass.
hi.
yeah.
right.
okay, well, they hired a female toby.
good for the world.
thank you, god, for creating two of you.
here is how things work here: my job is to make the office fun.
your job is to make the office lame.
and we have an eternal struggle, you and i. and only one of us can be the winner.
spoiler alert: I am going to win.
yeah.
t-no.
he tortured me... with his awfulness.
y-you can-michael.
thanks to toby, i have a very strong prejudice against human resources.
i believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters.
what i failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad.
like e.t.
is holly our extraterrestrial?
maybe.
or maybe she is just an awesome woman from this planet.
here she is!
holly... you know, if we hung holly from the ceiling, we would have to kiss underneath of her.
so-i know.
oh, sorry.
question, are you real, or are you a hollygram?
i bet.
i bet.
are these guys boring your ears off?
oh... what, um, what is your commute like?
how long does it take to get in?
you know, i should make you a mix.
do you have a, uh, a cd player?
all right.
yep.
hmm... jim?
i am downloading some n3p... music... for a cd mix tape... for holly.
and I am looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
the two levels being, uh, "welcome to scranton"... and "i... love you." hey, what is the group that was from scranton that made it big?
was that u2?
i think i do.
well, it was love at first sight.
actually, it was-no, it was when i heard her voice.
it was love at first see with my ears.
well, you are not a romantic.
oh really?
like, with who?
pam?
yeah, you took it too slow.
this thing with holly feels a lot like love to me.
i do not want her to get away.
hello, holly.
woah, what are you doing?
you do not, uh, you do not have to do that.
i mean, we have already put-together chairs.
that is how we buy them actually.
and the sequel, "woman stands at desk and works." so, i have no idea how you,  how you sit like that.
sit on floor and put together chair we will.
yo-da.
um... so are you in down this weekend?
because, I am not-I am not... I am not going to be in town.
I am going out of town.
kidding.
acting!
acting!
yeah.
i did it!
i talked to her-holly.
just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want.
hey, i can take either side of the bed at this point.
it was hard.
i wanted to kiss her.
whew, oh god.
laying a base.
laying a base... yeah... oh, there he is.
thought you had gone home already.
why do not you go home, and come back for the party?
yes we do.
I will let you in on a little secret: I have been very much looking forward to this moment.
very, very much.
i-i have been steeped in anticipation.
toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and i am now his cruise director, and my name is captain bruisin'.
can i just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
hey!
hi, good to see you.
I am just having a little exit interview.
um, no, no, no.
this is very boring stuff.
why do not you take a tour?
have you seen the baler?
okay.
um... alright, well then, i will proceed.
i just have some questions that i was going to ask.
um... who do you think you are?
yeah.
correct.
um... what gives-what-what gives you the right?
sure.
you know what?
that sounds good.
I will take a little look-see.
thank you.
what would you improve about dunder mifflin?
well, no no no no no... no no no no no.
I am not asking it.
I am just reading it out loud.
I will kill you.
oh, no no no, no, no.
no, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what i think... that i do not even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and i do not know which is which... what the hell is that?
that is... what do you mean, "michael"?
that is not even my handwriting.
hey!
what the hell is going on here?!
who thought it would be hysterical to give toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
no!
okay, you know what that is?
you know what that is?
that is... a psyche.
psyche.
so, that is not my real gift to toby.
my gift is forthcoming, pam.
i am going to give toby... ...yes, i am.
that was it.
how did you know that?
how did you know?
well... that is my watch.
hey, that is good.
oh my god.
ryan... oh my god.
I am just worried about my friend.
just, I am fine.
I am holding it together.
i-i have a business to run.
I am cool.
holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker.
i would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here.
she has that kind of warmth.
I am pretty sure she is baked on a professional level.
no antigravity machine, huh?
ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
that is what she... a lot of places are like that.
thanks.
i like, uh... hey.
what are you doing?
what the hell is going on here?!
there is a raccoon in the car, dwight!
why did you do that?
no.
there is no such thing as playful hazing.
dwight, i want you to look at holly right now.
everybody, i want you to look at holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what i see in her.
and that is that we are all very lucky to have her here.
holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since world war ii.
fifty years, she is the best.
take care of that, all right?
shh... I am really sorry.
yeah... did you see that!
did you see it?
did you see what... wow-wee!
uh, well, jan did not believe in showing affection, so... sometimes i do not know how to react when a girl touches me.
oh... i like it!
alright!
let us hear it for darryl and his band.
you know what?
let us also give a shout-out to phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
probably the best one that we have ever had, right?
but the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again.
now, a lot of you know that i am an accomplished songwriter.
i have done things like um, "beers in heaven." or, "total eclipse of the fart." i love to sing them, but i am not going to be doing that today.
i am going to be doing something i wrote specifically for toby.
do you know, um, "goodbye stranger"?
supertramp?
it was early morning yesterday... i was up before the dawn... and i really have enjoyed my stay... toby must be movin' on.
goodbye toby, it is been nice.
hope you find your paradise... come tomorrow, feel no pain!
feel no pain!
toby!
toby!
tobee-yy!
toby's going away!
see ya!
he is outta here!
see ya!
he is outta here!
ohh!
goodbye toby!
goodbye toby!
goodbye toby!
goodbye tooo-by!
oh, hey.
thanks.
oh, okay.
yeah.
well, actu-too soon.
it is uh, it is uh, very sexual.
sorry.
kevin.
kevin, where are you?
you missed my song, buddy.
just pay for it and we will reimburse you when you get back.
what is it?
yeah.
he is at the supermarket and he needs me.
yeah, that is true.
do not move a muscle.
i will be back momentarily, all right?
no, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I will-okay, I will be back.
of-kay.
hello january wow, kevin, really?
we are-  sorry.
we are in the middle of a party.
is this why you called me down here?
oh, okay.
thanks, kevin.
um... wow.
i can not believe it!
look at you!
are you nauseous?
do you-do you have cravings?
you never touched my propecea, or my accutane, did you?
good.
good.
thank god.
because that is... wow, i am so happy.
i am so deliriously happy... because you are pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together.
and, i am very... ... proud.
um... you cheated on me... when i specifically asked you not to?
well, okay... so it is mine, and it is not somebody else's, so... i know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so... you did?
when we were going out?
w-i do not understand.
you always used to be very cautious... I would wear two condoms.
you would rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
ihop.
I am glad you told me.
um, I will... i have to think about it.
my whole life, i have known two things: i love sex, and i want to have kids.
and i always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, i think it might be one or the other.
hey.
yeah?
oh, wow.
well, i can see andy proposing to angela.
i can also see him proposing to oscar.
oh... oh, um, well, you know what?
you should go to the glider diner.
ask stanley about that.
practically lives there.
have a good night.
bye.
well this is it.
i am here to see you off.
sorry.
corporate policy.
you might take something.
okay, security guard.
okay.
hi, jan, it is michael.
i just um, i just want to let you know that i am going to go to your lamaze class tomorrow.
um, and if there is any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly lamaze is, that would be great.
and i... will see you tomorrow morning.
i am going to be... kind of a daddy.
oh, my god.
toby flenderson, come on up here.
come on, no, no, no.
toby!
toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it.
it is very funny and charming and heartwarming.
and it rhymes, and if it is not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp.
no!
so, take it away, toby!
whoo!
ach,  okay, okay, play the cutoff music.
blah, blah, blah, blah... ...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome!
let us keep it moving!
let us keep it moving!
toby, everybody!
all right, everybody.
this is your last meal, so eat up.
this summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches.
whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.
dwight, dwight!
no, i will ex-squeeze you.
ok everybody.
get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every monday for the next seven mondays.
oh, pamcake.
no, no, no.
we would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose.
vamoose, pam.
dunder mifflin family only.
jimbo.
did you see holly's butt?
why?
i know.
i learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year.
i learned that she is allergic to sesame seeds.
i learned that she has read "lonesome dove" three times.
and that her butt refuses to quit!
you have to agree with me.
that is insane.
i thought you had to pee.
hey, hey!
pam, pam!
hey!
i wrote you a goodbye poem.
it is really long.
i left it up in my office.
could you just please wait till i go get it?
no.
ok. um, the last word is "seagulls." i took a lot from other poems.
all right, call- ok, no, no, no, no, no, no.
same places as last week.
yes, it does.
no, this is about weight displacement.
we have to have the same weight distribution.
right here.
here we go.
let us move that up.
here we go.
all right.
all right!
I am mc mike scott, and i am hot.
she is dj jazzy flax, and she is the best.
all those sucker branches can suck our fat!
hi, january hello, baby.
how are you?
good to see you.
who is your daddy?
you do not know who your daddy is, do you?
no, you do not.
come on.
let us go in.
no way.
no way.
pam beesley.
hello.
hey, everybody look, pam.
pam, say hi.
say hi to pam.
do not we all look skinny?
oh, oh, almost dropped you!
pam, I would like you to meet ronnie.
we call her rice-a-ronnie.
she is hilarious.
she is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office.
not really so much.
all she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
oh, calm down, weirdo.
it is just a joke.
she is such a weirdo!
you know what?
my real beef with her, though, pam?
she can not find those little colored paper clips that i like so much.
will you help her find them, please?
let us go.
we are following pam to the supply shelf.
let us go.
ok, everybody, let us suck in our guts.
damn it.
come on.
here we go.
everybody on.
how is it going?
good.
cake?
who suggested cake?
are you kidding me?
we only lost one pound, phyllis.
what is wrong with these people?
they have no willpower.
i went -- i once went 28 years without having sex.
and then again for seven years.
does anyone have any idea what the number one because of death is in this country?
no.
thank you.
holly is right.
people, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days.
this is about a very cool hr initiative that if we do not follow, we are all going to die of obesity.
so how much are we going to lose?
yes, all right.
who else?
can i put you down for 10 pounds?
if you gain weight, you will die.
i want you to live forever.
i want us all to live forever.
how?
how are we going to do this?
this is how we are going to do it.
five pounds.
I am asking each of you to lose five pounds.
that plus jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
booty call.
here.
wait a second.
i do not want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
you want more?
it is a pretty lame party.
you know what we should do?
we should have a party and not invite them.
let us go mini-golfing.
uh... um, i think you will have fun.
men from scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
you know what?
we are pretty much done here today.
why do not you just take off early?
yeah.
good luck.
oh, holly does not need luck.
everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
ok, everybody.
phyllis, did i or did i not say fruit?
and what is that?
you know, we are going to have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
ronnie was bleh.
things were at an all time sad here.
but then i got an e-mail from ryan, that he was coming back to town.
and i called the temp agency and i told them i will pay you any amount, just give me ryan howard.
give him to me.
i want him.
i need him.
i did!
yes.
gooooo-tee!
hey, you know what?
i can not do this by myself people!
kelly and i are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out.
mmm-- mmm...  um... close the door.
this is your fault.
your stupid friend zone.
i should have been lovers with her first and then friends.
that was terrible advice.
terrible advice!
you know my seduction method.
i like to get in there and get my hands dirty!
wh--  you sabotaged me.
you sabotaged me, man!
mmm-hmm.
saunas.
gah, the dreadmill.
ohhhh!
bang!
boom!
say clump!
why hello everybody!
i say, i say, i say, i say down holly!
I will take it from here.
i am beautiful.
they are beautiful.
he is beautiful.
this big fat pig is beautiful.
it is my sumo suit.
i just did not inflate it all the way.
i am so glad that i bought instead of rented.
body image.
we are here because there is something wrong with society.
if it is me, then society made me that way.
now, i know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?" how do you know michael clump?
how dare you!
michael clump is a celebration of fat people.
no, no, no, no, no!
you know what?
fat people are not monsters!
why do not you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.
bang!
boom!
case in point!
look at the outside of this building.
it is ugly.
but you come inside... and it is beautiful.
just like this unappealing fat suit.
inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
hey!
why do not you just sit down, please?
we are doing this because of you.
so why do not you just go stand somewhere else.
hey.
hey.
you shaved?
why?
dwight, i would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
ok phyllis, thank dwight first.
you are right, you are right.
just, dwight, do it.
just say it ok. finally.
right?
ok, phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.
why do not you have a seat?
let us all clap at phyllis.
ok!
when michael clump wants to remind you  that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.
and in order to be healthy, you have to eat, kelly.
kelly.
kelly, i want you to stand up on your chair.
come on, stand up on your chair.
stand up, stand up, stand up.
somebody help her.
here we go.
ok, i want you to look at her.
she is a beautiful indian woman.
why?
what makes her beautiful?
ok, be more specific.
what about her looks?
kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
i want you to know.
kelly, look at me!
i want you to know that you are beautiful.
you are truly, truly beautiful.
give me a hug.
mmmmmm.
hey ryan, look.
shaved off my goatee.
i am goateeless.
we are the goateeless brothers.
ahaha, yep!
oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
hey!
excellent!
good job.
yeah, oh, hey.
did he call?
no no, did, i heard you talking to oscar about that guy.
what, what happened?
did he call?
i dunno.
i always call everybody back right away.
he will call back though.
give him until the end of the day, he will call.
if he does not, he is loco.
ugh.
wait, do we have until the end of the day?
hey, is that healthy food?
we are trying to win a contest here, kelly.
please?
ok, that is fine.
just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
aww, really?
i have to say, i think the problem with that whole thing... ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
i know.
i love counting crows.
wow, really?
that is a shame.
a shame to waste these.
i want to buy them from you.
i do.
no.
i do.
i, i want to.
trust me.
i really do.
ok?
alright.
alright!
just, i want you to just forget about him, ok?
case closed.
umm, can i pay you tomorrow?
i have like a 60 dollar limit on my atm, so... is that good?
ok. darryl, would you do the honors?
nonono, no, no, i do not want to hear moaning.
this is a good day.
you guys accomplished something big.
you lost a ton of weight, literally.
a lot of weight.
and i do not care what any stupid scale says.
you guys are all gigantic losers.
no, you know what we are going to do?
we are going to take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.
hello, hello.
hey!
your face is almost back to normal.
hey, oscar!
come on, let us go!
i am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.
okay, no, i am not.
dwight!
i want you to take jim's chair.
no!
no!
his chair at his desk.
he gets it back on friday.
i want you to get your ass out of my face.
that is what she said.
well... you are...you know what?
i read in one of those books that you are not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.
I am digging.
i can not wait to be a father.
I am going to smother that baby.
i really, i do not want to get panty liners, please... i know, it is... yes.
i want you to get the panty liners.
what is going on?
to be married?
woo!
alright!
"why are you helping her?
you are not even dating."  she is my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing.
uh... ok, let us give it for miss... holly flaaaax!
ok.  well done.
good speech ryan, you are a good guy.
well, i think we can all totally agree that holly is totally fantastic.
can not set  them up like that.
can we have a moment?
can i talk to you for a sec?
lot of good stuff.
and you look... you look fantastic.
yeah.
do some... do some work.
people expect a lot from these meetings.
laughter, sudden twists.
surprise endings.
you need to be robin williams and m. night shyamalan.
you need to be robin shyamalan.
do you... just... you are kind of losing them.
lauren,  enough with the pencils.
i would not... steal the bread.
and i would not let my family go hungry.
anybody?
this is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.
stanley?
oscar, come on.
i will go first.
when i discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube</a> i did not work for five days.
i did nothing.
i viewed cookie monster sings chocolate rain about a thousand times.
to tell you or not.
and I am glad i did.
i feel very very good.
cathartic.
i promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.
you can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
yeah, .
come on, anybody.
let it fly.
a siesta!
you are a thief of joy.
anybody else.
yeah?
who has not?
good.
good!
what else?
mmm... well, let us keep this party movin' on.
bruuuuuuuuuce.
ach!
wuh-- that is crazy.
that is crazy talk!
meredith!
the merenator, sleepin' with suppliers!
hoo-ooh!
wow!
what time we got?
you know what?
that is a good place to end it.
right there.
this, i think, was a great ethics seminar.
she has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.
right... what is wrong.
who is to say?
really.
in the end.
i mean because it is... unknowable.
but, let us give her a round of applause.
holly, everybody.
holly!
get back to work.
great job.
i am truly impressed.
that, uh, you really pulled that one out.
classic.
classic meeting.
we should celebrate.
oh... meredith, why do not you tell holly... it is not what she thinks.
nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
no... no, this is just a stupid formality.
well, well.
holly... lujah!
it is a miracle, you are at your desk.
hoo-ooh!
reaching!
you will get there.
anyway, i was giving it some thought, and there is no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can not, you know, just... sit down and work this whole meredith thing out.
good.
would you care to bang it out over lunch?
oh no, no, no.
your food is no good here, my lady.
sorry!
you know what?
let us go out!
dunder mifflin's treat.
um, actually you are not a client... so... we will just split it?
ethical.
what do you think?
what do you think of this place?
istn't it?
yeah, it is kind of... business/romantic.
so you are from des moines?
wow, that sounds so... warm.
here too.
you know what my favorite season is?
yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.
autumn was what i was going to say.
when the leaves change.
it is just, i... i think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
wow, terminator, terminator.
yeah.
i just do not want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.
i mean, what sort of place is that to call home?
and meredith needs this job.
this is her main source of money.
ok, new idea.
we do not report it at all.
we just punish her.
mmhmm, tell her she can not have sex for six months.
i do not know.
i saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
no, it is more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.
you know what i am talking about.
you unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the... i am just saying that i do not think that you understand what i am saying.
yes.
well... bleh busted.
i do not... well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
i will be honest with you.
that car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.
the only reason i am standing out here right now is because i do not want to take the elevator with her.
and i am holding on to her leftovers.
what is the only thing worse than one hr rep?
you get me.
i do not know.
can you?
kendall, my main man.
let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
how do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "i told you so."  gently with a rose?
in a funny way, like it is a hilarious joke?
or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse?
... probably the funny way.
ok, everybody listen up.
if you are not in that conference room in two minutes i am going to kill you.
get in there right now or I am going to lose it!
now is really not the time, meredith.
let us keep this rollin'... ryan?
oh, cr..., oh, god.
meredith, you know what?
i just need a minute, okay?
what do you need?
i... really want to keep you.
wait, what?
nnnngah!
yeah.
ok, just remember to keep breathing.
ok, good.
oh, ok!
ok!
i get a call from jan and i meet her at the hospital.
i take quincy ave to gibson.
i checked the route - there are no potholes.
come on, get in here and have the baby.
andy, would you like to have my baby?
all right, ok.  sorry.
sorry.
here we go.
here we go!
do it!
do it!
scream!
scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
aaaaaaaa!
just keep pushing... I am right here.
I am right here, I am right here.
all right.
dwight.
just push and breathe.
shhh.
no, you can not have it.
it is too late.
no.
you have to just push it out!
keep simulating.
ok!
keep simulating.
yes, i do!
ok. yes.
aaaaaaaa!
it is coming!
here we go!
oh!
god!
wow!
what was on that?
nice touch.
good.
let us try that again.
it is going to be the happiest day of my life.
hello ladies, how is my shower going?
phyllis, did you get the live storks?
damnit, phyllis!
I am sorry.
damnit, phyllis.
it was hard enough to convince jan to come.
so are we set for refreshments?
she said it is the name of a viking princess.
so... i know.
i know.
it is beautiful.
no.
thank you.
is this it?
i mean, is this... two bowls of m&amp;ms and some balloons?
you know what phyllis, i think you need to step it up.
i think you need to get the lead out.
because if I am not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.
we all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.
well you know what, where is my golden shower, phyllis?
it does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.
i am going to love it.
it is like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.
have you seen that video?
it is... it is so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.
hey, hey.
what are you doing?
do not talk to them.
make the party.
do not - make the party, please, phyllis.
pump it!
ahoy, matey.
ahoy.
so, how you doing?
um, listen.
jan levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which i have a vested interest.
it is all kind of weird.
anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive.
and you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.
so, while she is here i am going to be acting kind of cold to you.
and i am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.
and I am treating ryan the same way.
so this is astird.
oh, ok.  why did not you call me?
i could have helped.
oh, man.
him?
that guy?
he had no sense of humor and i proved him wrong in so many ways.
no, i do not!
can i hold her?
all right, ok. i love babies.
i think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.
i try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.
it feeds my soul.
babies are drawn to me, and i think it is because they see me as one of them.
but cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.
if a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.
there would be no government, and things could get terrible.
it actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.
ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: assst... ...trid levinson.
hi!
astrid, this is everybody, look.
this is your family.
you are going to know them for the rest of your life.
well, he may not be here.
say hello!
ok, here we go.
lion king!
ok, come on, let us get our shower on.
conference room, choppity chip chop.
I am fine, weirdo.
such an hr weirdo.
try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
ready to play some games?
let us do it!
uh, duh.
no, the baby does not ruin anything, kevin, ok?
the baby multiplies the fun.
let us just do what you were going to do.
all right, how about some presents?
i want to see some presents.
i got this so i can write down for thank-you notes.
whatta we got?
oh!
she already has a stroller.
ok, what else?
hey!
hey, no no no no no no no no.
no.
no.
this is the birth story.
it was beautiful.
it was beautiful.
this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
and i should have been there.
i should have been there to witness this.
i could have helped.
uh, yeah.
i usually love babies, but when i held astrid i just felt... shortchanged.
phyllis?
could you take-.
hey guys.
uh, i need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
yeah, i a baby daddy.
um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?
like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
i just saw this baby daddy- why, darryl, because I am quote white quote unquote?
well- it is- that is different.
that is not a baby.
could i?
i was just going to...  i was going to talk to holly, about her hygiene.
she smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
sure you can not stay a little longer?
all right.
all right, everybody, we are leaving.
jan and astrid are leaving.
ok?
wha - that is, i hate her.
wha - god!
why would you even ask me to - i, i mean, not that it matters, because i do not, but wha - ok, all right, fine.
all right.
you want to go out?
i did not feel much when i held astrid, but i got a good feeling from holly.
oh!
ok!
seventeen.
i say seventeen squares.
do the boobs!
hey!
hr lady, stop whispering in the corner please.
very rude.
you are ruining the party.
hey.
that was really fun last night.
I am actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
yeah?
oh really?
well... i, uh...  i let her win.
so, when, um, can i see you again?
no.
okay.
oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good.
because i am busy taking you out.
why?
wow... oh, wait a second, i can not tonight... tonight's so... too many times.
it is all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
you are welcome.
in my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex.
does holly feel that way?
i do not know.
i will probably find out tonight.
if she starts having sex with me I will know for sure.
yeah.
some of what we order depends on whether we are having sex after.
oh, my.
wow, elephant in the room.
are we, do you think?
do you think we are going to have sex tonight?
okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... we will just do the restaurant thing first.
probably get soup or something light.
no.
no.
reservations are at 8:00, so we have got like an hour and 45 minutes.
I am a crazy eight, I am crazy.
do you need  them?
all right.
thank vous.
what?
oh!
not if we turn these dials  all the way down.
now they can not hear us at all.
we are totally alone.
oh, my god, what happened?
yeah.
oh... oh!
no, did you?
oh, no, my god.
oh my god!
so much for sex without consequences.
we are going to make everything all right.
alright?
conference room, 15 minutes.
half an hour.
alright?
to recoup their losses, i am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over scranton can come and bid on our goods and services.
I am calling it crime-aid.
it is like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against aids, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
thank you.
okay, I am going to have to stop you right there.
was this a sorority that you did not get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
okay.
okay!
well, come on, let us have an auction.
let us do this.
we will auction off people like in the olden days.
i do not know, it could be any number of people.
it could be a pedestrian.
it could be an old person.
it could be a lookie-loo.
or, it could be... a bruce springsteen fan - what?
who said that?
i did.
why did i say that?
oh, i think you know why i said that.
i think it is very apparent.
i think it goes without saying.
bear with me.
there is a point there.
but what is the point?
i do not understand what he is saying.
it seems a little shady.
it seems a little foggy.
well, it is not a little foggy there is actually something going on here- do i?
yeah, i think that is pretty boss.
whoa!
twice.
... right?
mm-hmm.
pump it up!
yeah!
yeah!
yeah!
pump up the volume.
thank you very much, everybody.
thank you, mr. springsteen.
and welcome to c.r.i.m.e.-a.i.d.
crime reduces innocence makes everyone angry i declare.
it is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics.
however, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs.
really phyllis?
you are auctioning a hug?
okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction!

listen, about the tickets.
it is sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not i had them- okay, i think we are set.
we have puzzles, string for cat's cradles.
burned this last night.
a little road trip cd.
puppets.
when corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer holly back to her old branch, in nashua, new hampshire.
road trip!
right?
oh, copy that breaker.
those duke boys are at it again.
we are not.
we are not doing anything.
all right everybody.
I am out of here.
jim, you are in charge.
ah, you are quite the gentleman.
you can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
cool!
we are going to switch back and forth, the driving.
sometimes we will just meet in the middle.
it will be fun.
wait a sec.
oh i love this song.
ah!
ah!
ahhhh!
hey.
whew.
ow.
i was having a nightmare.
was i?
really?
was i saying anything interesting?
all right.
what is the scoop, how far?
halfway!
okay, you know what i want to do, i want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle.
emphasis on the bed.
and the breakfast.
yeah.
i do not know i just- i imagined a hotel right here.
pool, over here.
really good breakfast place.
with really good bacon.
here we go, fourth time's a charm.
"life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...sometimes you deal with it, today you do not, sometimes you do, what you want... there is a world out there....
hey.
are you crying?
allergies?
did darryl touch you?
what is the matter?
sure it is.
oh no no no.. it is going to work, it will be fine.
listen to me.
i like you so much.
and I have dated four women in the last- not last - no.
in like the last ten years.
I have dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
that is what she said.
holly thinks that this relationship is over.
well, you know what?
i am not going to give up that easy.
I am going to make this way harder than it needs to be.
yeah.
okay, okay.
i will talk to you on the bluetooth the entire trip.
so we are talking constantly all the way.
I will tell you everything that i see.
everything that i pass by, things that i witness on the road.
maybe I will see an accident one weekend?
years!
yeah.
here is my wish.
i want you to meet a great guy, and i want you to be happy.
my wish has come true, incidentally, because, you have met me, and you are happy.
you know what?
i think we are a great couple.
i think we are a classic couple.
i think we are like romeo and juliet.
i think we... go together so well.
we are like peanut butter and jelly, do not you think?
then do not do it.
please do not do this.
please do not do this.
i do not know what I am going to do!
please?
I am not going to be okay.
no i will not!
I am not strong!
and I will go back to jan, and i hate jan!
oh god!
oh that is mine actually.
um, maybe put it back in the truck.
you know i have some things i need to do this weekend.
i just remembered, so, I will just ride back with you.
I will be down in just a second.
holly?
so um... i think I am going to go back with darryl  okay.
goodbye.
we did not break up.
okay.
that is a really pretty song.
okay.
okay.
da  na na na na.
da  na na na na.
da  na na na na.
da  na na na na.
da  na na na na!!
da  na na na na.
da  na na na na.
da  na na na na... this is going to be awesome.
this is going to be awesome.
I have decided that on my drives to nashua, i am going to learn french, the language of love.
and on my drives back, i am going to learn spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.
okay, am i grabbing this one?
fair enough.
okay, okay.
what kind of car games did you play in the 'hood?
cow surfing?
really?
cow surfing.
okay, here we go, there is a cow.
oh, shoot!
okay.
all right.
all right.
pull it over.

I am going to do it.
the man has a point.
what?
why?
i do!
hey, come on!
jackson five.
you are the one.
you are.
no, you are.
you are the best.
you are better.
you are better than my best.
here we go.
okay, ready?
watch this.
darryl, watch this.
yeah yeah.
right, snuggle time.
here is what i was thinking.
the following weekend, i drive up.
we get right in the car, we pop up to montreal.
it is like another seven hours.
speak.
absolutely.
oh, and you know what, darryl?
you are invited to go as well.
come on, it will be fun.
hey, look at that.
fun, right?
mmm mmm!
remember the 15-scooper we had last week?
was not that good?
i was scooperman, you were scoopy-doo.
remember what you said?
you were laughing.
say what you said.
I will save you!
I am superman!
scooperman!
i did not ask.
we want the same things.
that is a lucky number.
seven.
7-up.
seven dwarfs.
seven deadly sins.
it is a sign.
oh, it is really cold here.
yeah.
can we have another?
i think i blinked.
oh, you have your own entrance.
that is nice.
hey, sport.
ow!
god!
no, we would never do that.
and if we did, it would be with jim and pam.
yeah, so there you go.
oh, wow, so quickly.
nope.
nope.
not yet.
I will call her later.
i do not want to do that.
all right.
she is going to freak out!
that is -- thanks.
mom, I am getting married.
why do you always do that?
whenever I am getting married, you do not believe me.
no.
I am not, I am not getting married.
so...  psych.
and I am out a fiancee.
are those the customer surveys?
I will take care of that for you.
thanks.
kelly kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. and once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople.
sort of a kapoor's list.
"schindler's list" parody.
... that is not appropriate, no.
alrighty, dwighty, let us see how you did.
no.
wow.
dwight, your feedback is horrible.
a number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
no, no, no, no, no.
do i look like i am joking?
if i were joking, you would be laughing.
do you look like you are laughing?
you are not.
jimbo, let us do this thang.
oh, come on.
you too?
jim, they are a poopy.
no.
yes, i am sure, jim.
it -- i agree.
so let us see what we can find out from reading.
jim halpert is smudge and arrogant.
arrogance.
and there is our smudgeness.
here is what is going to happen.
i am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management.
jim, what is that called?
boom!
yes.
now, jim is going to be the client.
dwight, you are going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult.
let us go.
ask him his name.
be respectful, dwight.
it is up to you to change his mind.
boundaries, dwight.
come on!
he is hard of -- he is an old man.
let us go.
stop it!
stop it!
that is totally inappropriate.
you never yell at the client.
you never yell at the client.
here we go.
give me the phone.
give me the phone.
give me the phone.
give me the phone.
hello, this is michael scott, regional manager.
hello, mr. buttlicker.
how may we help you?
see how it is done?
thank you very much, sir.
i do not think you will regret it.
see what i did?
yes.
...  it is a million-dollar sale.
why do not you tell us?
dwight.
i was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
what is going on?
kelly.
you cannot say "i was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, kelly.
not again.
do not keep doing that.
I will give you one last chance to come clean.
just tell me what happened.
do not.
do not.
get away from that, dwight, please.
you know what?
she is got a point about you two.
you do have a problem dealing with people.
you were lying.
yes.
jim, dwight, please excuse us.
i will call you when it is time.
i have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place.
and i hate it.
i can not tell you how much leftover guacamole i have ended up eating over the years.
i do not even know why i make it in such great quantities.
here is what we are going to do.
we are going to sit here for a while, make it look good.
and maybe you should cry.
can you make yourself cry?
i think you should do that.
how did i propose, let me see... well, i drove her up to nashua, and i had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful.
and i got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star.
and we were in a restaurant, and i put the diamond into a cheeseburger.
and she took a bite, started to choke.
so what do i do?
i have cpr training.
go around, start doing the heimlich.
the ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger.
million-to-one shot.
all of the greek people in the restaurant start screaming "opa!" which means "congratulations," so... I am pretty much devastated.
maybe go to sandals, jamaica.
or the other sandals, jamaica.
i just do not want to go by myself.
why are surveys important?
okay, hypothetical: a man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots.
and, so he is like "what do i do?
where do i go?
do i go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman?
or do i go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots?
most companies need their carrots the next day.
now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important." great marks, phyllis.
i taught jim and dwight everything i know about sales.
but there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that i now must teach them.
attention, all problem sales persons.
jim halpert... dwight schrute... intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch.
that is all.
did you know that in morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time?
in japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.
in italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.
this is considered to be polite.
i am jetting off on an international business trip.
to can-a-da.
canada.
my boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and i have always been intrigued by all things international.
the women, the pancakes, the man of mystery... meredith, i would like you to pretend that you are from abu dhabi.
i am ashamed at your naked face.
i must cover it with my jacket.
you are now sexy in your culture.
i have my passport.
i have my per diem.
i already know what i am going to spend this on.
i am going to buy a sweater.
well I will just... I will use different money for that.
and business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.
actually better than a five-star hotel because you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.
i think i am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
well that is all in the past.
they have one of those?
let us do this!
two are for souvenirs.
i do.
it is right here.
no, i do not want to wear a bra.
stop it!
stop it!
okay.
where is my translator?
there he is.
yeah baby!
that is what I am talking about.
that could be you  if you had not forgotten french.
where is my numbers man?
there we go.
our town car awaits.
its not just a van.
dwight, can you get those please?
welcome to cribs-the business class edition.
check this out.
mimosa.
handed to me as i sat down.
this was my hot towel.
it is still wet.
take a sip of that.
that good?
do not drink all of it.
give some to oscar.
you want one of your own?
i can hook you up.
yes, this is beth.
this is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
yes... get back, get back.
come on, get back to the slums.
hey... guys, check it out.
my own personal dvd player and 20 movies.
shhhh!
keep it down.
could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?
my god, oscar.
really?
do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody?
no, i will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
hi.
um.
I would like to see a menu please.
oh... okay.
does not matter, because i am going to take a nap.
i think i am going to use my complimentary blindfold.
i will don it... and oh!
look at that.
i can not see because i am in a-  gah!
this is nice.
this is nice.
move in here.
very sweet... ah.
alright.
very cool.
okay.
yes!
wallace said there would be one of those.
wow!
wow!
wow, i am blown away by this.
i, um... i-ah!
this is great, thank you!
a concierge is like the winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.
this is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.
and when you meet one, it is intoxicating.
just what the doctor ordered.
guys, she is in there.
let us do this.
excuse me, hello.
concierge marie.
michael scott.
good to see you again.
um, this is my associate uh, from dunder mifflin, uh, oscar martinez.
works in accounting.
this is uh, concierge marie... ...who works at our hotel.
you look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
and it is, how do you say, a beautiful night-- she is foreign.
i am- oh, thank you.
thank you, andy.
everyone is going to end up dying someday.
and i think it is better to die with people you like... like oscar, and andy, and concierge marie... than to know that there is somebody out there that you love that you are not with.
how about this one?
it is christmas eve-- --and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done.
12:00 midnight.
where do you go?
what do you do?
what do you do?
come on!
what do you do?
unbelievable!
unbelievable.
do you want to get some breakfast or something?
okay.
slept like a baby.
look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.
they feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.
they are treated like human beings.
yes.
yeah, we locked him up for two years.
no.
actually the trip sucked.
the trip sucked, david.
it blew chunks.
it was terrible.
it was a bad trip.
i did not like the trip.
well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
and business class which was basically just coach.
and the hotel which sucked big time.
it was not, it sucked.
oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.
that was great.
that was great.
that was-- that was a-- that was a really good choice.
no, david.
you listen to me.
why did you send her away?
that-- god.
you knew i liked her and you just sent her away.
and that-- that was a sucky thing to do man.
that was a really sucky thing to do.
why have i stayed at dunder mifflin for so long?
certainly not because of the paycheck.
because i could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.
i think it is because they respect me.
a boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone.
that is respect.
oh brownies!
I am taking two so i can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
yeah why do not you send that to him in costa rica?
heh, okay, weirdo.
she said she was going to give it to him right now.
yeah, they used to.
oh, can you imagine?
uhhgh.
i do not know.
what?
hmmm, dare i?
you know what?
I am going to, for old time's sake.
great practical joke jim, you got me to go to the annex.
noooo!
god!
no, god, please no!
no!
no!
nooo!
look at him.
with his stupid face.
stupid... tan.
no.
no.
he looks worse.
uh, well I am afraid not.
toby flenderson, of h.r., has made a sudden reappearance.
not on the surface, no, but i can tell people are disturbed, david.
yes.
i learned a while back that if i do not text 911 people will not return my calls.
um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
i did not want to go back to the annex because that is where holly worked whom i loved.
that is true.
people say it is icky.
david, wait.
is there no way we can get rid of him?
i have because.
it is be-because i hate him.
no.
i do not.
do not do that.
you want to see some really high caliber acting?
well, mr. kurt russell, you are about to be served.
hey toby, great to have you back, man.
seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
you are welcome.
missed you.
missed you as part of our family.
so costa rica that was - did you have fun?
that must have been fun.
nice beaches, pristine beaches?
why did you come back?
why did not you stay?
i bet, for you.
shhh hot, why did not you get an air-condition-- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
yeah, i am.
i am.
i tried, i tried.
i tried to talk to toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail.
i feel like I am dying inside.
i feel like neve campbell in sream ii.
she thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.
i learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
okay, just summarize.
that is it, that is it, perfect.
we will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
mm.
me too.
okay, let us get this started.
what are you doing?
for what?
no, no, no.
you are the bait for toby?
no, for one thing, he is not gay.
and if somebody were to be bait it would be jim.
or ryan.
or me.
yes, sure they do, dwight.
pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.
hello, pam.
jim may i have a moment with pam please.
oh, oooh his mistress.
no.
I am kidding.
no one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, pam.
okay, what i would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to toby flenderson?
i just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.
do not read it beforehand.
can you do that for me?
good.
n-no no no, do not.
pam.
pam, you gave me your word.
um, i got some photos from costa rica if you want to see them?
toby can i see those?
ooh.
what is the matter?
what is the matter?
you scared?
you mad?
you mad at me?
do you want to do that?
you want to hit me, you want to punch me?
huh?
he might do it... i dare you to.
come on.
what is the matter... haaaww!
hey hey!
come on, ryan, who is side are you on?
no do it, do it.
i dare you.
not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.
come on!
come oooon... son of a bitch.
just stop it.
you have not done anything helpful all day.
what is that?
frame him?
I have never framed a man before, have you?
just seems awfully mean.
but sometimes the ends justify the mean.
hello.
I have seen you guys around.
I am michael scott, dunder mifflin.
how you doing?
uhghh, so i guess you know why I am here?
i need to purchase something.
no.
uh, i wanted-- i wanted to buy some weed?
some... grass, weed?
i heard you drug--  i heard you dealt.
I am not wearing a wire, so... how much?
how many pounds is it?
hey, hey, hey.
hey.
i forgot... i forgot... those are real cops, real guns.
i wonder what is going on.
uh, you know what?
i think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
yeah, let us just cancel this, okay?
no, no no no... no, no.
no, that was... that was legitimate.
that was totally legitimate.
oh god!
no, no no no no.
god!
no, that is not... i do not know what that is.
and i... i bet he has nothing to do with that!
ahh, that is mine.
yes, it is mine.
are you kidding me?
that is my salad.
you must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
hmm.
since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
are you kidding me?
are you kidding me, that is who you are worried about?
you are... you are worried about the cop's time?
you think i framed you, and you are worried about the taxpayer?
dah, god!
welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
you said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.
so... yes, you did.
and then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
do you want to hear a lie?
i think you are great.
you are my best friend.
mmm... okay.
yes.
yes, i can see... that we did indeed.
why do not you explain this to me like i am an eight-year old.
yes.
there is the x-ax...icks.
mmhmm, okay.
why do not you explain this to me like I am five.
ho-oh!
yeah.
I will be six.
so the dollar's a surplus.
this is a surplus.
whoo.
okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, i-i think I am getting you... guess what, everybody?
christmas has come early this year.
oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget.
thank you, oscar.
and i have decided with that money i am going to buy a new, drum roll please...  can anybody guess?
no, a new copier!
unless everybody can agree on something better?
so... we all agree to get new chairs then.
good?
okay.
okay, good suggestions.
all good suggestions.
uh, let us just decide and agree upon one.
alright, so, teams forming.
you are the silent killer.
go back to the annex.
yes.
why me?
wow, okay.
well... i swallowed all your ideas, I am going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
yes.
i do not know.
i have not decided yet.
really?
absolutely!
yeah, that would be amazing.
yes.
ohh, god!
yeah!
best lunch ever!
woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
all right!
cool!
i have no idea.
oh, is somebody making fun of me?
yeah.
yeah?
oh, hey.
i do.
it was fun.
we had a good time.
oh, thank you.
um, no, not... no.
no, i got it at tj maxx, four dollars.
you think that is good?
check out these pants.
nine dollars.
nine dollars.
the boys' department.
look at the ass.
check out the ass.
look at that.
unh.
unh-unh.
yes they were.
they were.
mmhmm.
sits on a copier.
yeah.
very valid.
all right.
see ya.
hahaha!... well... okay.
oh, thank you my dear.
oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all.
okay... there he is!
hello, hello!
hello!
good to see you!
good to see you.
mm!
yeah!
hey hey!
yeah!
unh!
oh... ah, i almost choked.
hank, thank god you are here.
the office is at a crossroads.
yes.
i need your sage advice.
and everyone, whatever hank decides, that is the decision.
that will resolve this issue.
yeah, take as many as you want.
yes.
okay.
well, we have a surplus.
imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand- oh, okay.
good.
good.
well, here is the thing.
some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier.
other people are complaining about the chairs.
it is, yes.
what?
okay.
oh, there we go.
now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever hank says goes.
he is an impartial third party.
so, the copier.
all right, yes.
well, what should i do?
all right, get out.
get out.
hey david-  I am sorry.
I am sorry.
I am eating tiramisu.
some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat.
I am stopping now.
no, no, no, no, no.
no.
I am calling-  I am sorry.
mm.
I am calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
no, no, no.
i want you to make the decision so I am not the bad guy.
the what now?
...like a tip?
$645?!
i hate disappointing just one person.
and i really hate disappointing everyone.
but i love burlington coat factory.
you go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
all right, attention everyone.
i have made my decision.
we do not need a new copier.
we do not need new chairs.
this copier... is...  working perfectly.
pam, would you stand up for a sec?
hmm.
see how relaxed i am?
i like this chair.
offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it is a good chair.
i think we are spoiled because we do not appreciate the things that we have.
you think kids in africa have chairs?
no.
they sit in big piles of garbage.
you think they have copiers?
they do not have copiers.
they do not even-  gah!
they do not even have paper.
and we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it.
my point i this: i have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
do i know what?
mm, no... $645.
right.
because that is how my mind works.
let us see... i do not need $645; i already have $645, more or less.
this is so stupid.
this is so, so stupid.
and, god...  that is my phone.
to be continued!
no, i do not-this does not change anything.
i have a very important decision to make.
we need a new copier.
we need new chairs.
and i need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
you think it is easy?
okay, you know what?
why do not you guys deal with it?
i am going to get up, and i am going to be out in the common area.
but you need to decide; otherwise I am taking the bonus.
all right?
it is a classic management tactic.
you have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are going to concede.
what you do is you put  them in a room, and you just-  hey.
what?
good work.
I am proud of you.
mother- what did we learn this week?
well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than i thought they would be.
number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it.
and three,  you should know that some people think it is cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of burlington coat factory.
hey, phyllis, do i need this invite to get in to the party?
awesome.
i think this is going to be the best christmas party ever.
oh, hey, is that princess unicorn?
i thought they were all sold out.
cool.
my horn can pierce the sky.
this is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of splenda.
call it a one of everything.
alright... one more time around the block.
jim, jim....
that is vodka and i mixed it with orange juice.
i call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
yeah.
i know.
oh, so this is what every day would be like if you had not left india.
can not do it then.
monthly dental appointment, soft teeth no, no.
i celebrate privately.
why do not we just do it now?
we will do it quickly.
we will do it quickly.
what if we can not do it quickly?
what if we can not do it- hey, shut up.
here we go.
everybody gather up.
an intervention.
it is sort of hard to describe, but really its- it is a coming together... it is a surprise party for people who are- who have addictions.
and you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.
and then they stop.
okay, how do you feel?
uck... t.m.i.
okay, you know what i thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
i am not asking her to stop drinking.
i am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
yeah, obviously you are.
okay, everybody who thinks that meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.
the aye's have it.
alright, well, let us look at this a little bit closer then shall we?
meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the mormon church?
i got it on a website, that is not important.
okay, you know what toby?
one of my employees is undergoing a crisis and i wish for just once you would take my side on this.
I am doing your job man.
hey, are you texting?
alcohol is a drag.
yes.
here is what I would like to do.
I would like to go around the room and have us each express to meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.
I will begin.
this christmas party is perhaps the best christmas party i have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.
that is how your drinking affected me.
anybody else?
another time when meredith's drinking affected you?
come on people.
if we do not say anything she is not going to get any better.
yes, kevin.
that is- you did not- you were not hurt by that.
okay, no, that is not what we are going for.
who has a problem with meredith's drinking?
it has to bother you.
it bothers me.
right?
how does it bother you?
dwight, do not you have anything?
who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?
who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
was john belushi fine?
was bob hope fine?
hey- come here.
if anything ever happened to you, i would be very angry at myself for not doing all that i could do.
i want you to say I am an alcoholic.
you can say it as loudly as you want, but we are not going to believe you.
alright, no, no, no.
no.
that is the image, i think we can all agree is very disgusting.
but you know what, meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.
what about tomorrow.?
what is going to happen when you come into work and you are dead?
everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.
the next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
dwight- ...okay.
enabler!
enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.
it is christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
you know what the only thing i want for christmas?
i want meredith to get better.
that is my only wish.
but you know what?
my wishes never come true, so I am not going to wish that on her.
i- a watch would be nice.
I will be down in a minute.
could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
we did?
oh, shoot.
oh well, we will have to go someplace else then i guess.
we could go there, sure.
yes, yes.
i have a new place.
it- yep, recently.
all right.
yeah, oh there you go.
that is good.
we are party girls.
it is okay.
it is all right.
meredith, we are doing this for your own good.
okay.
come on- here we go.
this is going to be good.
yes you are.
shhh... just calm down.
come on.
shh... here is the door.
here is the door.
let us start meeting- hello.
how are you?
i have a deposit.
alcoholic.
so do i sign?
as it turns out you can not just check someone into rehab against their will.
they have to do it voluntarily.
they have to hit rock bottom.
so i think i know what i need to do at this point.
i need to find ways to push meredith to the bottom.
um... i think i can do it.
i did it with january yeah!
yeah!
yeah, okay!
twelve miles an hour.
eat that, carl lewis!
no.
no, no.
there was wind.
dwight, there was wind.
i want a do-over.
i want another try.
here we go!
thirty-one!
thirty-one!
i was ahead of the car.
thirty-one is my new number.
go, oscar.
thirty-one's my number.
beat it!
today's a big day.
my presence has been requested by  chief financial officer, david wallace.
he says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff.
and, I will be honest, i have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
wait, you still do not know... you still do not know.
what are you doing?
andy.
no, what I am saying is... no, that is not it.
how can he still not know?
i can not take it anymore.
i am telling andy.
who should it come from, then?
are you still having intercourse with her?
did you ever have intercourse in this office?
well?
you know this can not go on.
we have to put an end to this.
come on.
when will she be ready?
is she crazy in bed?
how so, specifically?
really?
it is too late.
i am already walking.
okay, what does that mean?
jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
thanks.
andy?
walk with me.
ohh, i do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what i have to tell you.
and just bear in mind when i say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that i, if i were you, that i would not want to hear... well... no, I am not.
so i... I am not very articulate today, so I will just leave it for another time.
another day.
which will be fine.
i am off!
thank you!
okay.
i will... dwight and angela are having an affair, so... dwight and angela are having an affair.
they have been sleeping together for some time.
that was the news.
i wanted to let you know.
all right.
see you later.
ahh.
yep.
right what?
david, here it is.
my philosophy is basically this.
and this is something that i live by.
and i always have.
and i always will.
do not ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what.
no matter... where.
or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you have been... ever.
for any reason, whatsoever.
sometimes I will start a sentence, and i do not even know where it is going.
i just hope i find it along the way.
like an improv conversation.
an improversation.
this is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here?
i always think better when it is cooler.
hey, what say we order up some pasta?
so i was in the office, and i look over to our accounting division, and there is kevin malone.
kevin is wearing a jacket that I have never seen before.
and i call over to kevin, "kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" and he looks at me and he says, "michael, yes it is a tweed jacket." and i look back at him and i say, "i feel the need!... the need for tweed." oh, thank you.
i have to say, i am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
okay.
wow, what a day!
haha!
i thought i was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on!
here is an attaboy for ya!
what?
rollercoaster ride!
rollercoaster!
it just goes to show, you leave scranton, exciting things can happen.
ahh!
what you talking bout, wallace?
hi, i am well, how are you?
oh, have you not?
yeah.
okay.
fax, why do not you just send it over on a dinosaur?
oh, well, then, email it to me.
i will seduce her.
no, i will seduce her.
no, i got it.
yeah, so what if i did?
that would take precedence and i would expect your support.
alright, i am a local business owner.
i need to buy paper.
i find out everything about their prices and policies michael scarn.
okay.
no.
no, no, i never said denny's.
ihop.
oh, do not start, you know what?
i do not want to get into this debate again.
i enjoy ihop.
you will have pancakes and you will like it.
so what?
maybe they are shrinking.
they could be shrinking.
ah ha  yup.
mm hmm .
and there are clouds.
there are clouds in the sky, which means going to rain, bad for business.
argh, why are you all... shut up.
ready to do this?
good.
here come the sharks.
in nature, there is something called a food chain; it is where the shark eats a little shark.
and the little shark eats a littler shark.
and so on and so on.
until you get down to the single cell shark.
so now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
hello.
my name is michael scarn.
i am a local business owner and i would like to find out about your company.
thank you.
we are a law firm.
you know, i will be honest with you... about something.
where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and i just did not feel like a priority.
so i guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have?
really?
that many?
this does not seem like a very big operation.
ah, so when did you set up shop?
oh vietnam, i hear it is lovely .
so, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
well that is... because... i am a genius.
yes, well about some things, and other things i am very stupid.
like, watch this.
is this the cup?
is this the cup?
is this what i drink out of?
laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
try 80. hey, hey, how is your interview going?
do not blow it.
hey linda, can i get a picture of you?
i would, could you just stand over here?
that would be great  just a little something to remember the trip by.
a little to your left what is going on?
little homework over here?
let us see if i can help.
huh, math, that is not so hard.
ok. there are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
why is this little 2 so small?
it is, it is weird, you do not, you just go by the x. the x means times.
4 times x 2. what is double 4?
excellent!
way to go!
nice!
oh, well thank you very much for all of your help.
it is going to be an incredibly hard decision.
i... okay, okay, okay,  alright, thank you.
of course.
thank you very much.
thanks for your time.
i cannot wait to contact your clients.
haha, we struck the mother load!
wallace is going to freak.
he is going to absolutely freak.
oh shoot.
oh god, what was that?
aw, it is alright.
aw, my car.
no no, we are fine.
you have done enough already.
just, shut up.
you know we are just going to call a tow truck, so... no, no, really not necessary.
you know let me give you some money for this.
oh coffee, that is too much.
thank you.
ok, goodbye prince family.
dwight, what will happen to that family if i call david and give him this information?
ok. you know, our sales are fine.
we are doing fine.
they are doing fine.
why do not we just, live and let live?
live and let live.
it is from james bond.
I am not going to make this call.
my heart says... that is true.
that is true.
we have gone down the wrong path many many times.
january.. ryan.
you are right.
you are right.
i will call david and give him the customer list and i will give him all my info.
just something i have to do first.
somewhere safe, where it can not hurt anyone oh shoot!
those people will be ruined.
give it, give it.
we can not do this to those people.
I am not a shark.
mpfh.
thank you.
okay, bye bye.
i guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment.
it is bitter because i slightly destroyed a wonderful little family.
but sweet because david wallace thought i did a good job.
that is what i hate bittersweet chocolate.
i do not even... what is the point of that?
why not just sweet?
who are you helping?
oh, hey what is this?
oh, she is hot.
oh my god!
okay, it happening.
everybody stay calm.
stay  calm!
everyone, now  calm down!
what does warm mean?
do not run.
get out of the way!
go, go, go!
okay, we are trapped.
everyone for himself.
help!!
help!!
no, no, no!
you will not die!
stanley!
stanley!
you will not die!
stanley!
stanley!
barack is president!
you are black, stanley!
I am going to give him mouth to mouth.
he is going to swallow is tongue.
open your mouth.
come on.
do not swallow it.
leave me al- saving him!
electricity.
he would.
hedded take hedded of.
heed.
heed.
take heed of.
take heed of.
okay.
this city.
dwight.
we are not mad, we are just disappointed.
yes.
we are.
we are livid.
but we are going to let this one slide.
i am not a mind reader, david.
and we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.
something that dwight does not like.
do you?
you talking to me?
what?
no, dwight.
i am worried.
a man's life is in my hands.
yeah.
that is not going to happen.
I am taking over as safety man.
yes.
I am a smart guy.
I will figure it out.
no, i will.
nobody should have to go to work thinking, "oh, this is the place that i might die today."  that is what a hospital is for.
an office is for not dying.
an office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... an office is a place where dreams come true.
shhh!
do not excite him.
do not make him excitable.
welcome back, stanley.
andy.
no, no, no.
no debate.
you are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
okay, you know what?
that could be a little confusing, because in sales a-b-c means "always be closing." shut it.
shut it.
we found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when stanley had his... when his heart went berserk.
and i knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense i had no idea what to do.
so i thought we should have cpr training class and of course you can not get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it.
red cross, you know, racket.
you know who i really think should go?
stanley.
come on.
no rest for the sick.
we are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.
what are you going to do if you are by yourself and your heart stops?
and you are okay with that?
uh-uh.
no, no, no.
come on.
get up.
let us do this.
come on stanley.
you are losing you.
you are losing you.
do it!
this is you we are talking about.
okay, okay.
I will show them.
here we go.
stanley.
all right.
no, rose.
they are not breathing.
and they have no arms or legs.
where are they?
you know what?
if we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them?
i mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
how about no arms?
no arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, kevin.
you do not do anything.
okay, that is uh, hard to keep track.
how many is that per hour?
i will divide and then count to it.
yes, yes i do.
i love that song.
first i was afraid, i was petrified.
okay, i got it.
ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
ah, ah, ah, ah... he is an organ donor.
yeah.
hey, stanley.
are you okay?
five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
okay, look.
david, this is why we have training.
we start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes.
and now dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
hi, everyone.
corporate has given dwight two strikes.
they are very, very upset with him.
so, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology.
dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
let us hear it.
ohmmm... ohmmm... everybody sit on the floor indian style like me.
ohmmm my god if you are wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm... my goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for stanley hudson as i can.
i think sounds have a lot to do with that.
here are some downloaded peaceful sounds.
that one makes me think... of death.
it is kind of nice... it is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful.
now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
and you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream.
you want a big bowl of ice cream.
what kind do you want?
shout it out.
too expensive.
racism is dead stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want.
what do you want?
what is that?
people!
please i told you to get rid of the cell phones.
oh, ok. what is that, like, a video game?
you have stress?
during our relaxation exercise?
no no, I will help you.
I will help you up.
here we go.
let me getcha.
ok, alright.
ok. ok... i think that thing is on the fritz.
ahh... oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing?
that is what he said!
right guys, because of gay?
let us give this a shot.
hellloo... so... it was not dwight after all.
looks like i am the killer.
you never expect that you are the killer... it is uh... great twist.
great twist.
i do not get it.
do i stress you out?
oh... remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... look at that perm, that perm is so boss.
it is what made me want to become a boss.
and i looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads.
but now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
ok everybody, I have figured it out.
the reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think.
you are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what is causing stress.
so, what is the solution?
solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy.
in short... what?
no.
no, i am talking about a roast!
of michael scott!
oh c'mon!
who here has the comedy central roast channel?
you have seen it right?
everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other... si senor.
it is not!
it is not offensive during a roast!
anything goes!
i want you guys to really get crackin on this.
i want you to take me down.
do not hold back.
i want you to really make fun of anything about me.
it could be my race, could be the fact that I am so fit, or I am a womanizer... fair game.
whatever.
i do not want to write your stuff for you, but i just want it to be good.
i can already feel people's stress starting to melt.
i think they are very excited about paying their respects this way.
i have got to make sure that youtube comes down to tape this.
whoo!!
welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome.
you are all jerks.
just kidding, not yet anyway.
welcome to the roast of mr. michael scott.
if you are here for the grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.
so, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot.
i am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may.
ok... lower the mic for the midget.
hey hey, i do not go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers.
ha ha!
you are so lucky!
good one... well... pow pow pow... no!
no, friends only.
friends only.
i know where this is going.
no... no.
spite her - ok oh, stop it dwight.
no no no no no no!
dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
that is the way you are supposed to do it, idiot.
idiot.
idiot!
idiot.
idiot.
idiot.
hey, ya know what?
forgive me for caring.
right?
can i make just a little announcement.
in a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they are done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
we are, we are a family.
oh very funny.
uhh... hehe hah!
I am thinking roy?
i do not believe i have had the pleasure.
jefferson.
haha ha.
thank you very much, thank you.
that was great.
great job, great laughs.
really, really went after my intelligence there.
dozens of online iq test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing is not tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight.
so when i heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, i thought  sorry.
i think i have a frog in my throat.
um...  i decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up phyllis and kevin.
uh um... caw... caw... caw caw... caw... you know sometimes, to get perspective, i like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away.
and, our problems do not matter to him, because we are just a distant point of light.
but he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face.
I am okay.
no, I am not.
i um, i spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, i guess they all flew west for the winter, and i, i just had some thoughts that i wanted to share with you people.
well i wrote them down so i would not forget.
jim, you are 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, gumby has a better body than you.
boom.
roasted.
dwight, you are a kiss ass.
boom.
roasted.
pam, you failed art school.
boom.

meredith, you have slept with so many guys you are starting to look like one.

kevin, i can not decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke.
boom.

creed, you are teeth called, your breath stinks.

angela where is angela?
whoa there you are, i did not see you there behind that grain of rice.
boom.

stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks.
boom.

oscar, you are...  oscar, you are gay.
andy, cornell called, they think you suck.
and you are gayer than oscar.
boom.
roasted.
alright.
alright everybody, you know i kid, you know i kid.
you guys are the reason i went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, god bless, god bless america, and get home safe.
they say that laughter is the best medicine so stanley, you can throw away those pills.
you are cured.
actually, you should... better hold onto  them pills, just in case.
this is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories.
look out your left hand window and you will see vance refrigeration.
i am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me.
yes michael scott for dr. jocelyn, please.
hello doctor i was just following up on my mole again.
no, i was looking online about sebaceous cysts.
i have not been squeezing it.
could i stick it with a pin?
toby flenderson to the principal's office.
your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again.
so you have to get home to wash your sheets  because they are yellow and they are wet with your urine.
you, and at six foot six, from the university of north carolina, jiiiiim halpeeeeert.
what?
you find it?
all right.
would you like fries with that?
please drive around.
hello, good morning.
you ready?
and we are off, like a herd of turtles.
well, pam and i have eloped.
actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam.
no, uh,  seriously, i am on a lecture circuit.
apparently scranton has the best sales of any regional branch.
so david wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except nashua, still a little bit raw there.
um, but i am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success.
my 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter.
oh that, well, that is pam.
pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so i can focus.
and i like to pack heavy.
no!
that is a toboggan, you never know when you are going to find a snowy hill so... every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and pam is my hot roadie.
yeah, oh do not say bucks, it is not lady like.
here we go!
okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
well that goes without saying.
hey!
look at what you are wearing again, pam.
have you ever seen a magician's assistant?
that is... ...kind of  maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
no.
oh, all right.
no.
i need silence or sam kinison to prepare.
then listen to your ipod, pam.
well then... hey you know what then let us just talk.
you nervous about seeing karen again, since she was the other woman?
actually you were the other woman so... is that why your wearing makeup today?
hello, rolando, how are you?
rolando,  I would like you to meet pam.
she is our receptionist.
you know what?
maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
okay, do not be nervous, just picture her naked.
that is what i do, steal my trick.
oh my god.
is that jim's?
okay.
wow.
oh man!
my head just exploded.
whoo!
thank god, for everybody right?
whoo kay.
wow, you are huge!
that is incredible!
i... god sorry, sorry my head is... I am just, I am trying to figure out the last time that you and jim had sex, and... okay, mm hmm.
ten, ten months?
no!
oh, my god.
oh, no.
that is so awful.
that is the worst news.
i have to go.
i have to do a presentation.
I will talk to you...  this is going to be hard for me to speak today.
because i just learned that my father has died.
... no, he did not!
he is alive.
and this is not even a cell phone.
this is a calculator.
but you bought it!
and now you can not return it.
or can you?
no you can not.
yes.
karen, do you need to go pump?
i am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience.
like i sold you on the idea that my father had died.
would a liar bring mini mounds bars?
i am a theatrical person.
growing up, i always thought i would become an actor.
because i have, these memorization tricks that i use.
um, for instance, i learned the pledge of allegiance by setting it to the tune of old macdonald.
i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under god.
with a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there.
here a woof, there a woof.
everywhere a woof, woof.
um, you get it.
i do not know you.
but i need to know you in order to sell to you.
that is why i have asked you to go around and tell me you names.
i have an amazing mnemonic device, by which i have memorized all of your names.
shirty, mole, lazy eye, mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman.
i have taken a unique part of who you are, and i have used that to memorize your name.
baldy, your head is bald.
it is hairless.
it is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror.
"m" your name is mark.
got it.
it works.
but it works.
i would like you all to give this a shot.
what do you say?
well, then it will be easier for you.
but i, i still think it is worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
oh, i still have more.
she is pregnant.
she is knocked up.
"k" karen.
pam, let us go.
i grab this , and i turn it on and i say, "prepare yourself, for the utica chain store massacre." no, do not worry, the chain is off.
email's not scary.
this is an opportunity.
do not, do not blow it.
it is really amazing.
congratulations karen.
so is there a guy or, uh, a person.
or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
oh, great.
no, it is really dorky.
you were right the first time.
old hatreds dissolve into new friendships.
it is a really wonderful moment.
i would give that lecture a solid b+.
although, for the record, karen.
wow, kind of mean.
really?
no, honestly.
tell me what you really think.
why?
no.
I am just thinking about what you said, about karen, about closure.
you remember holly?
she used to work for h.r.?
blonde hair, nice boobs.
not too big, not too small.
she was the love of my life.
what you and jim have times 100. just she... she just left.
and i did not... i never got closure, you know?
i never got closure with her.
i have not talked to her since.
i have not seen her since.
and i feel like i need to go to nashua and get closure.
i feel like i need that.
I will just blow off the lecture at rochester.
okay.
i am on a lecture circuit.
I am going around to all the branches, and I am telling them my secret recipe for success.
i have now memorized all of your names.
shirty, mole, lazy eye, mexico, baldy.
and i turn it on and i say 'prepare yourself for the utica chainsaw massacre.' you remember holly?
she used to work for hr?
she is the love of my life.
she just left... and i never got closure.
and i feel like i need to go to nashua and get closure.
do i look okay?
hi.
yes, you can.
i am, uh, michael scott, regional manager of the scranton branch.
thank you.
... um... is, uh, holly flax anywhere here?
oh- she is not here?
a.j.
she has a boyfriend.
how could she do this to me, pam?
i can not do the presentation, i can not-  ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, god!
i know, just... uh, please, I am going through something, okay?
and then she will move back to scranton.
and her boyfriend will die.
i can do this.
goooood morning, viet-nashua!
sales.
sales is what bwings us together, today.
how do we deal with clients who say, "frankly, my dear, i do not give a damn... about paper" and get them to "show us the money!" well, we are going to find out today.
show of hands.
how many of you are salesmen?
let us see the salesmen.
oh, okay.
well i know what the rest of you are thinking.
wow, yuck.
salesmen are the worst!
they are awful.
they are so arrogant.
they think the whole place revolves around them.
handsome, good listeners, funny, mr. wonderful.

it is all connected.
shut up.
does she ever mention 'michael scott?' does it feel good?
your life.
oh, wow.
whew.
ahh, legs are sorta giving out.
long drive in the car, so let us just- we will just continue.
oh, wow.
ooh, okay.
yeah, yeah... uh, i can not do this pam.
just read from- just read the cards.
no, no, I am okay.
I am all right.
okay... okay.
want some pie?
i went through holly's things.
i stole a sleeve of her sweater.
i also stole something off of her computer.
a document called "dear michael." i should not have done it.
it just- i could not help it.
no, sh- she did not.
I am going to read it.
yes.
how?
i know, i know.
you are right, you are right.
no, that would not- no, you do not have to do that.
okay.
well?
she said that?
is that what it said?
what did it say?
you are sure?
okay.
i feel great.
so good to have closure.
ah!
we should go apologize to roy or something.
who have i wronged?
who have i wronged?
oh, oh!
what about that fat guy from stamford that i insulted?
we should find him!
jabba the hut, pizza the hut, fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni tony!
man, was he fat.
so, so... fat.
you know what, forget it.
i know me.
when i saw him, i would never be able to apologize to him.
too fat.
big fat fatty.
hello, may i help you?
...jim.
ayyyy!
ayyyy!
what was that?
that was funny.
let us go do it to somebody else.
ayyyy!
oh, look at that.
cupids and hearts.
really shoving our faces in it this year.
you doin ok, bud?
yeah, i hear ya.
it is been four months since i was with holly, and she was way hotter then stacy.
so if you think you are hurting... oh, wow look at those.
how nice for you.
up there, front and center, beautiful.
i think they would look better right here.
they are very pretty and i would not want them to fall.
just about everyone in this office is single right now.
including me.
and everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.
especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first valentine's day since holly, so i think that i am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
pam, really, they are back?
can i have a word with you, jim?
yes, um, jim.
today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
yeah.
and the sexy looks between you and pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it is creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
mm-hmm.
well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest- -that none of us can be a part of- -then, we, are going to have our own private valentine's day party.
so suck it.
hey everybody, i just invited jim to suck it, and i am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon.
singles only.
so we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
i am about to give blood.
the gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that is a big needle, that -- okay.
hello.
oh, ok. yeah, me too.
oh, well, that is fine.
yeah, can i point something out to you?
you are actually talking a lot.
okay, here we go.
oh, god.
yup, I am good, whew.
wow, i feel like a human juicebox.
hawaiian blood punch.
type of-ocean spray.
yick.
i looked at the bag.
i looked straight at the bag.
could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that do not have blood in them?
that was mean.
a hat.
that is full of soup.
what?
oh, already.
whew, wow i was so nervous about this i do not think i ate for three days.
oh my god, how long was i out?
excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
ok.  oh, wait a second, wait a second, that is hers.
this is hers, she left her glove.
i need her name if I am going to return her glove.
well here we all are.
alone but together.
no flowers for us.
relationships, we do not need no stinking relationships.
i think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah?
kelly, what about ryan?
he treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
yeah, but now his heart is in thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.
okay, sorry, let us, who else?
oscar.
come on, I am sure there is something you need to get off your chest.
if you want to just, anything?
are you sure?
I am sure whatever you did it was not your fault.
ok well, who else?
moron, if he was there would not be a story.
really sad.
oh my god.
well then it is a happy ending, because he was gay.
you should call him!
alright who is next?
where is andy?
what?
you know what guys?
i do not think we need to do this.
no, no, no, no.
i mean have this kind of party.
i look around and i see all these beautiful people who are alone on valentine's, and i think that there are other single people out there too.
we just need to find them.
there is a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.
there has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
no.
not a giant net.
i was thinking maybe like a mixer.
old fashioned meet market -- -- i do not think it is.
these people need love and i am going to get it for them  who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?
a great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.
i am going to be cupid, and i am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say "I am in love i was hit by cupid's sparrow."  funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
hey.
ah, still early.
so how you holding up?
no.
no, i meant about being single today.
meh, exactly.
eh.
oh, here we go.
hello.
babe alert!
hello, I am michael scott, welcome to our little shindig.
lynn, follow me, come on in.
for you we have one of our top people kevin malone.
kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
so run with the ball!
run with it, kev.
where you from?
yeah, ok.  well, he only gets better.
so, eric.
you mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that is sort of a repair.
alright, I will let you guys talk.
it is going very well.
people are mixing, a lot of hope.
because that is what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed.
sorry, thought i heard somebody coming in.
um, so  it is not too late.
no reason.
nobody's after me, i just, i met a woman when i was giving blood and i thought she might come by.
it is not a big deal really, i just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, i picked up her glove so i was hoping i could give it back to her.
believe me its nothing.
i hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, i think our blood bags touched.
nah.
[everyone groans and girl turns around and walks away.
hey, you do not deserve her.
hey, if anybody wants to go... really?
oh, thanks.
you know what, you guys, you guys can get out I am going to soldier on a little bit.
ok. four months ago, i dated a woman named holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I have even considered getting back into that arena again.
you know what, sometimes it is not about whether cinderella gets her slipper back, but it is about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.
there is a lot of princesses out there.
you know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so i think, i think my odds are pretty good.
pam?
pam?
knock, knock.
i know you are.
knock, knock.
4-9-1-7-4-5-1 they would never know it was me doing it.
here we go, knock, knock.
buddha.
buddha this bread for me, will not you?
i, i need something to wipe my hand.
that was helping.
it was classic.
no... god.
alright.
who is there?
kgb - what the hell was that?
what are you doing?
you, you like that?
mine was retribution.
what are you doing?
no more knock-knock jokes.
that is it.
who is there?
dwight, get the door.
answer the door.
I am not going to answer it oh, no, no, no, no.
i am not michael.
i am willy wonkaaaaa.
why thank you very much.
oh, what are those?
what are those?
tell me, please!
no, no, no.
they are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl.
these are extraordinary jelly beans!
the willy wonka golden ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea i have ever had.
it is probably the best idea anybody has ever had.
three days ago, i slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments.
this entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order.
it will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
I have written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and i think i have done my part with the golden ticket promotion.
now it is your turn.
i want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine.
umm hmm.
too many words.
good ideas are simple.
'golden ticket.' no.
jim.
we are a business.
post-its.
that is a golden ticket idea.
nasa took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
no, you do not.
no, it -  what will be the state of this company if i am the only one coming up with the great ideas?
right?
woo hoo.
tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips... ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
invite them on the tour.
really?
that is kind of a big client.
hey, oscar.
woo hoo hoo.
um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our blue cross account?
yeah?
yeah.
i thought i did.
so... well no harm no foul.
you did not, but... it will be fine.
it will be good.
hey.
hey.
hey.
you idiot.
sir.
i placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with blue cross.
how does this happen?
irrelevant.
ok, I am going to ask you something and i want you to be honest.
what is a pallet?
my golden ticket idea?
ok. why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea?
there is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea.
that... nobody panic.
the good news is... they can not fire all of us, right?
no, they can not.
oscar, you do not know what the hell you are talking about.
alright, then we are screwed.
i am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so - thank you, jim is with me.
well you know what jim?
it is not my fault that you bought a house to impress pam.
that is why carnations exist.
ok, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.
yes.
ok, do not get that.
please?
that is not constructive.
hello david.
i just got back from my procedure, so- how are you doing?
my colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and i just do not... i do not know.
i think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
you are breaking up.
ok, i think, it might have been an inside consultant.
yes.
no.
yes.
come on in.
good to see ya, have a seat.
i just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
woah, wow, who told you that?
no, i do not think i ever did.
that was your idea dwight.
I am not taking... I am not taking... wait a second, wait a second, i wrote it down in my diary.
yes i do.
you have just never seen it.
march 4th.
dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
why do you have a diary?
ok, you know what?
you came up with this idea.
i remember you told me that you loved the willy wonka movie when you were growing up.
yes, you did.
what are you writing?
would you like to go to lunch with me?
just the two of us?
we think a lot alike.
sometimes you will think something and i will say what you are thinking- umm, nacho chips.
oh, ok. let me just cut to the chase, dwight.
i want you to fall on your sword for me.
why do you even want to stay at dunder mifflin?
i mean what is the point?
you are cooped up in there all day.
you do not get to do your farming.
you are not dating angela anymore.
it does not matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea.
it does not matter.
me on the other hand, i would be lost without this place.
you, way too manly.
it is not ready yet.
i have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called shoe la la.
and it is just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
may i have your attention please.
i have an announcement.
mr. dwight schrute and i just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although i probably will never do it again, i had fun.
i really had fun with my best friend, dwight.
yes they are, you just do not care about the information.
he does not love it that much.
would not be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
i mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion... right.
that is it.
that is it.
you can not put a price on freedom.
that is why you made the decision.
that is why you made... you kind of have.
yes.
oh my god.
dwight!
dwight!
get in-- what is it going to be, what are you going to do?
what is it going to be?
are you going to do this thing for me?
dwight?
hey david, how are you?
good to see you.
nice surprise.
dwight and i were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
yes it is, but it had to be done, did not it?
hey, dwight, great idea.
dwight, dwight, great idea.
how did you come up with that idea?
really?
how did- how are you inspired?
how did it pop into your head dwight?
give me the details of how that happened.
what?
david?
david?
david?
could i be a part of the meeting also?
there is no movie called willy wonka.
it is called willy wonka and the chocolate factory.
i can not... vouch for that.
but i do know this.
he is a liar.
he has taken my idea.
ok, here is what happened, david.
it was all my idea.
you called me and you were really angry at me and i got scared, so i had dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it is a great idea and dwight will not confess.
can you believe that?
oh how dare you.
you are?
good ideas, huh?
hey, did you come up with toilet buddy?
it is a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet?
formally known as toilet guard?
oh please.
toilet sponge.
it is a hollowed out sponge... ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper.
i have a lot of toilet ideas.
they are not easy.
everybody has to go to the bathroom.
thank you!
well david, i will be honest with you.
i do want the credit without any of the blame.
when they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that i had a good idea.
and that is what i am going to write down in my diary.
that is what i want you to write down in yours.
i want to see it.
i want to see it.
give me...  give me the diary.
i had no idea when i got in that car and headed to new york i was going to quit.
i got on that ramp and i thought two hours, two hours to go.
feeling good.
listen to some tunes.
should have peed before i left.
okay, so.
i get up to the building, i get to the revolving door... broken!
so i have to take the normal door.
no, no!
i was so nervous it was the wrong building!
i walked into the wrong building!
i looked at wallace and i said "i quit!" and as i turned to leave i looked back and i said "you have no idea how high i can fly." why would i do that?
you guys have thought about this a lot more than i have.
i just winged it.
scotch with splenda.
tastes like splenda, gets you drunk like scotch.
clinky, clinky-clink.
come-on... come on, come on.
what am i going to do?
I will tell ya what I am going to do.
i going to do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
i going to stay up all day.
going to sleep it up all night.
I am going to give it a ohh!
hey!
ho!
and I am going to stop worrying about calories.

if you will excuse me, be right back.
ah, okay.
hey.
i would like a pair of size nine, please.
it is michael.
okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
I am... excuse me.
yes?
yes, it is.
yes.
it is.
pam.
everyone deserves a second second chance.
ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
would you like to come to work for the michael scott paper company?
uh, nine.
look what he is doing.
he is stealing them.
okay, okay.
he is already paying for himself.
right here.
oh yeah.
sounds awesome.
people turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my nana's investment club can help the michael scott paper company become a reality, then I am sure that is what she would have wanted.
does want.
well I am sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so i appreciate you meeting with us here today.
what this is is a business that i have worked toward my entire life.
hey!
i have assembled what i believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today.
ladies and gentlemen, i present to you the dream team.
from our very own scranton, pennsylvania - pam beesly.
pretty pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one.
meet vikram.
from his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry.
and do not call it a comeback.
the youngest vice president in the history of dunder mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, ryan howard is about to make a splash in paper.
okay.
i have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry.
with a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, i think i can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
by wanting it more.
by working hard- mmmm-my mission is stated as follows: i will not be beat.
i will never give up.
i am on a mission.
that is the michael scott guarantee.
and i offer same day, free delivery.
nana.
i really think that papa would want you to do this.
well what is it exactly?
i mean, what, what specifically?
we do not - it does not have to be paper.
we could sell medicine and other... well... this might not be the right time, but i need more than i originally asked for.
okay.
okay.
yeah.
i have cable and satellite as a backup.
yeah, i know.
two not-so-great things in a row.
ehhhh, well.
stuff happens, right?
at least we got ryan.
the rye-guy.
we should call him rye bread.
we do not have to call him that.
unless you like it.
we could call him that.
what is that?
blech.
well you know what?
my mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world.
and that is why god made so many.
well we  should make a list.
lists are good.
lists are good.
lists are good.
first on the list, let us get you out of the car.
alright.
okay... i want you to listen to me.
because i want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay?
you quit your job.
i quit my job.
we both quit.
those are the facts.
that is what happened.
now, what are our choices right now?
because you know, kiddo, you quit.
so what are our options?
well, we can start this paper company.
we can try.
or... that is it.
that is our only option.
because we quit.
pam, i do my best work when people do not believe in me.
i remember in high school, my math teacher told me i was going to flunk out.
and know what i did?
the very next day i went out and i scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team.
see what i mean?
i thrive on this.
i thrive on it.
so I am going to go inside.
I am going to make some calls, I am going to get us an office space, and I am going to show you why you joined this company.
okay?
you got to have some extra space.
philly, work with me here.
there is got to be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... oh, no.
not there.
that would be humiliating.
i did what i had to do.
i stepped in.
i took charge.
that is what being a man is.
and earlier today, i was freaking out.
pam stepped up.
she was the man.
do not think a woman can be a man?
well, then that is your stereotype, not mine.
okay.
it is right in the middle of the paper belt.
yeah, I am good.
you good?
you know what they say, keep your friends close.
yes, i am, charles.
except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because i have started my very own paper company right here in the building.
if i were you, charles miner, i would watch your step.
because the michael scott paper company is about to open a big old can of whoopass on dunder mifflin.
actually a six pack.
we are going to open a six pack of whoopass.
he looks scared.
it is britney bitch.
and i am back, in the form of a new company.
the michael scott paper company.
okay.
not going to make this one.
hello!
they took away my parking space but they can not take away my pride!
i would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey.
welcome!
to the michael scott paper company!
we are in the heart of it.
and the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
we wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
i do not know i think we have done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day.
I have updated our contacts, i have gotten quotes from suppliers.
i have sent out an e-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon.
six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes.
um, and 788 not yet replieds.
but of that group, 782 have viewed it.
i am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper.
it is a coupon for unparalleled customer service.
hey you said you were going to be out of town this weekend.
hey ryan?
could you get to that copy from before?
listen.
listen listen listen listen listen listen.
i need someone to make a copy of this.
because i do not make copies, I am the boss.
got it?
i make originals.
stop it stop it!
bickering!
stop it!
would someone just make the copy?
just make that copy okay?
they are getting on my nerves mom.
both of them.
r thinks he is too good to be here, and p is not as much fun without jim.
I am on the phone, please.
mom, I am going to have to call you back.
p's being a giant b. they always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right!
so, i hired my best friends.
and this is what i get?
listen up.
it has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office.
and i think i have come up with the reason why.
this office space is too small.
okay.
there are ... 4 corners in this room.
each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you.
whichever corner you want.
and make it your own.
okay guys, thank you for the offers.
but i want you to get pumped about this corner idea.
all right?
1,2,3- what are we going to do?
no, you are supposed to say, "rock the house." that is my corner.
no, this is where i work.
i can not relax in the same corner where i work.
pam, i do not make the rules.
oh hey!
stanley, phyllis.
come on in.
welcome, welcome.
let me give you the tour.
thank you.
you remember ryan  and pam is around here somewhere.
what for?
yes.
maybe the michael scott paper company was a huge mistake.
i should leave.
i should go, and start my own paper company.
that will show  them.
get your free pancakes.
they are delicious.
they are nutritious.
they are complimentary.
young sir, would you like a free pancake?
ryan, enough with the texting machine.
come on.
and tuck in your shirt, you are the face of this company.
hey pam.
you sorta disappeared there for a while.
where ya been?
yeah?
well, at least you are still being honest with me.
these are shaped like paper.
i once had a dream.
that i was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich.
and, let me tell you something it was delicious.
so the next day, i decided to make that sandwich.
and in real life it is disgusting.
it is a disgusting sandwich.
and the reason i tell you this story.
pick up the phone.
do not tell them we have free delivery!
they do not know that!
give him a guarantee.
just say the word.
yes!
you did!
oh yeah!
she did it!
yeah!
yeah!
yeah!
yeah!
who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work?
and pancakes?
in the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs.
i realize that we do not have the biggest office.
which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot.
but, we have people with the biggest hearts.
and i think for a small company that is really  someone went to the bathroom.
that is really what is important.
hup!
hup!
hey.
is this good?
oh.
okay.
ed's tires, huh?
i really appreciate it.
it is for your trouble.
no, no, listen, as a friend, i want you to have this.
yes, i do.
that was four years ago.
why do not you let it go?
ed's tires.
why do not you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them.
also, try to discuss it over indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
that is smart.
that would not seem genuine.
ryan?
good, you take the lead on this one.
also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
bring it in.
morning cheer.
i need you to get me the prices that you are charging ed's tires so i can undercut dunder mifflin.
oh n- is it mose?
did you put the cover on that well?
I am not following you.
personal hero, cool new guy.
okay, i think I am getting your drift.
crystal clear.
so is this for a movie that you are writing?
can i use it?
dwight, are you talking about us?
someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
so i would say that the old boss has always been good to dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs.
you respect dibs, do not you?
good.
will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
dwight?
is the cool new guy charles?
is it stanley?
hello, dwight.
what is with the shirt?
are you alright?
oh my god!
run!
run!
it is a setup.
setup!
dwight, run!
you be cool.
just-what is going on?
mm-do... dwight would not- i. understand.
nothing.
wow.
it was a setup.
dwight told charles.
he told him.
it is like, a girl says she will make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
i got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, pam, ok?
i do not know how they did it.
they filled the balloon with pee.
a funnel?
i do not know.
is that clear enough for you?
hello, traitor.
i want you to listen to me, friend, and i want you to listen to me good.
i am going to come at you, and i am going to come at you hard.
i am going to steal all of your clients, and then i am going to kill them in front of you.
I am just getting hardcore with him.
yes, and hear me, dwight, when i say i brought you into this world, and i can take you out.
bill cosby.
is mr. schofield there?
well, if you could do me a big favor and tell mr. schofield that michael scott has tickets to the wilkes-barre penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... hello, daniel.
how are you?
uh-huh.
i sure do.
yes.
wanted to ask, did kathy ever make jv?
wow.
high score?
hello, dwight, I have been expecting your call.
what do you want?
so you heard schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
no.
no.
you think i am going to fall for that?
there is no- meet- ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
toward the sun.
noon.
you have two seconds.
dwight.
i hope you are not recording this conversation.
good.
i cannot believe that you sided with charles.
so you just rat me out?
you could have said no.
if you want a truce, i will give you a truce.
i do too.
cooper's.
damn it.
oh.
dwight-elicious.
where you at?
really?
that is weird.
we did not see any.
what?
yeah, sure.
okay, see you in a bit.
dwight hit a bear.
he will be here in a sec.
yeah.
dwight, not now, we have been robbed.
no, dwight, we were robbed.
how would you even know?
you are still stuck in traffic.
you?
what about our truce?
on purpose?
why?
be that as it may, i have your meatball parm sandwich here, and i am going to eat it.
oh.
bastard!
dwight, do you mind if we talk?
if you keep coming after us, the michael scott paper company cannot succeed.
oh, one more thing.
I am going to have you listen while i steal your biggest client.
oh, uh oh, I am turning you down right now.
you can hear me, but i can not hear you.
oh, great.
mr. schofield's ready to see me.
thank you so much.
walking in the door... mr. schofield, good to see you.
and I am closing the door.
now, when dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, i think he is speaking out of turn.
yes.
he does not have the authority to say that.
i, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder.
it is like you are buying software from bill gates.
what is that thing that dwight always says?
paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
that is very rude.
I am going to pull a date out of the air right now.
april 13th, 2002. that is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs.
is it not?
we all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like dunder mifflin... are going to fall by the wayside.
two of their branches have closed within the last year.
the michael scott paper company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
that sounds like a fantastic idea.
i will see you this weekend for the penguins.
box seats as usual.
good, good, good.
i will see you.
i color code all my info.
i wrote "gay son" in green.
green means go, so i know to go ahead and shut up about it.
orange means "orange you glad you did not bring it up?" most colors mean "do not say it." i wanted to start a company, not a war.
because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to.
and the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother.
for what?
what purpose did that serve?
apart from abolishing slavery?
in that case, war was the right choice.
this does not feel as important though.
that is just how the world works, i guess.
he gives me leads and i take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good.
and if a friend can not make you feel good, then i do not want any friends.
except dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
dwight just got howard family dry cleaners.
he is undercutting us big time.
he is actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.
hey, hey, hey.
something about that seems inappropriate.
betrayal are not just a river in egypt.
it is 4:30 in the morning.
do you know where your kids are?
if you are ryan's parents or pam's parents or my parents, you do.
they are going to be in this van.
with me.
who am i?
nothing to fear.
i am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
time to make the donuts.
come on.
whoa!
no, i promise i will not do it again.
come on.
de-nied!
hello!
time to make the donuts!
oh, halpert!
whoa!
boner patrol.
arrest that man!
your donuts make me go nuts!
hey pam.
milk and sugar.
that is what i said.
every morning.
we are, uh, we are doing okay.
a couple weeks in and, um, we are having fun.
uh, yep.
we have 20- of those.
you know what we need?
we need some couches in here.
oh, you know what you would love?
is if we built a loft.
like in a dorm room.
you put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.
you can sleep up top.
most do in the magazines.
we should look into that.
or we just go for the loft.
how much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
they are correct, sir.
okay.
a lame attempt at humor.
swing and a miss.
lowest in town.
okay, sure.
right, so- why do not you explain what that is to- so that they can under- just explain what that is.
explain that.
well, we do not- whatever, yeah.
our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
okay, okay.
hold on, hold on.
ty, i would like you to crunch those numbers again.
just crunch  them.
just crunch  them please.
hi, jerry.
michael scott.
well, this is slightly embarrassing.
um, I am going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.
yeah.
we did.
we got the check, but we are just going to need a much, much bigger check.
did i ever tell you about the day that steve martin died?
i know.
but i always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.
i was wrong.
it is this.
i would love that.
was it nice?
i love pad thai.
no.
there is a lot i have not done.
hmm?
we are not hiring, jim.
listen, i can not make you laugh right now.
jim, what you do not understand is that this company's worthl- no- we do not have- uh... yes.
yes, well, we are not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
that is a pun.
yep.
oh... wow.
of course not.
nope, nope, nope.
right, right.
there is no way in hell that i am going to say that we are broke.
oh, I am really worried that I am going to say it.
ah... I am good, I am good.
it is.
I am good.
hello.
michael scott paper company to see mr. david wallace.
i believe we are expected.
well, well, well.
how the turntables... and we are prepared to reject that offer.
never accept their first offer.
what is your second offer?
are you kidding me?
that is insultingly low.
i do not even want to hear what your first offer was.
I will see your situation and I will raise you a situation.
your company is losing clients left and right.
you have a stockholder meeting coming up and you are going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.
so they may be looking for a little change in the cfo.
so i do not think i need to wait out dunder mifflin.
i think i just have to wait out you.
we will have to talk- just amongst ourselves.
oh, my god.
oh, my god.
we are so rich.
no.
it is a lot of money, okay.
but we need money coming in every week.
we need jobs.
would not you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
agreed?
shut up, shut up.
hello?
i want my old job back.
i want my old parking space back.
i want a sebring.
and i want charles gone.
i need him gone.
okay, then i want pam back.
sales.
yes, she is.
at the michael scott paper company in it is heyday.
and ryan.
you know, david.
i do not care if ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
and dental this time.
these are our demands.
our company is worth nothing.
that is the difference between you and i.  business is not about money to me, david.
if tomorrow my company goes under, i will just start another paper company.
and  then another and another and another.
i have no shortage of company names.
that is one of  them!
yes.
these are our demands.
this is what we want.
our balls are in your court.
can we have the room please?
yes!
can you believe it?
that is what I am talking about!
there are certain defining moments in a person's life.
the day he is born.
the day he grows hair.
the day he starts a business.
and the day he sells that business back to dunder mifflin.
what have i learned from all of this?
it is far too early to tell.
i just know that i am flying high and i do not even want to think about it.
i just want to enjoy it.
no, no.
you are done.
someone is returning!
he started his own company, and now he is back.
who could it be?
I will give you a hint.
he is a man.
a man you have missed with all your heart.
a man who has ruined all other men for you.
who is it?
it is michael scott.
hold it up.
conference room, five minutes.
well, i guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and pam and ryan.
and how about casual friday again, huh?
reinstituting casual friday?
you all look great.
what i want to do right now is try something a little different.
I am going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.
i want you guys to run it.
i want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.
your meeting.
if there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
yes.
take it up with toby.
what i want you to do, is i want you to look inward.
and i want you to reflect.
and i want you to say something different.
when i needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.
am i going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?
no.
am i going to ask for big, crying apology?
no.
am i going to ask them to slit their wrists for me?
no.
i just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
oscar, what were you going to say?
all right.
not important.
okay, alright.
yes.
yes, you have a job.
frankly, you have a job because ryan and pam are starting with us as salesmen.
it is going to work very smoothly, because pam and ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from michael scott paper company and- no, you lost those clients.
okay.
okay, dwight.
let me explain something to you.
i set the rules and you follow them.
blindly.
okay?
and if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.
it is a trash can.
there you are, my friend.
pamela.
yep.
i know.
i do?
well-where is that bowl?
michael scott paper company only.
okay, well-- i will-no, no.
I will talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
against who?
the old michael scott might have taken this, but not the new michael scott.
they are in for a bitter surprise.
i am not to be truffled with.
six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.
you two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
that was  us, right there.
mm-hmm.
yeah, the commish.
yeah, yeah.
the shield.
hey gang.
where you been?
where did you eat?
what did you have, stanley?
so since you guys already ate, you will not be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?
oh, wow, stanley.
is that egg salad?
andy brought some salmon.
dwight, is that a meat sandwich?
you guys hungry?
I am going to of have some of this meat sandwich.
mom.
what kind of sauce is on your salmon?
mmm.
thanks for going out, guys.
hey, hey guys.
you know what i want you to do?
shake hands, get over it.
that was not a shake, dwight.
who quits?
you guys got to be kidding.
i love it.
i love this idea, and i fully support you.
as a matter of fact, I am going to give you some seed money.
there you go.
there is some seed money for you.
and you can take it, no hard feelings.
but if you stay, i want an apology,  and i want a big one.
yes i do.
it is frontward's.
no matter how i look at this, i am in the wrong.
and i have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.
from my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.
and the bottom line, i am in the wrong.
I am the bad guy.
i need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without ryan and pam knowing.
whatever you guys did earlier.
just do it, okay?
get  them there.
get  them there.
are you kidding me?
okay, okay, okay.
so from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, i am sorry.
if we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  "apology accepted", i think we would all feel better.
and then we can break out  my gift to you-complimentary white chocolate bark.
they would not make it unless people liked it.
okay.
if i give you your clients back there will not be enough clients for ryan and pam, and i promised both of them they were going to be salespeople.
fine, have your clients.
i can see that is what you wanted all along.
however, i rescind my apology.
you are not reacting at all as i had hoped.
jim.
can i talk to you for a minute?
and bingo was his name.
let us go.
i need your help.
this whole pam/ryan debate is screwing with my head.
you are close with pam too.
pro for ryan, he went to business school, he is my number one choice.
i like his hair.
okay.
that sounds pretty biased.
okay.
pam, pros.
i like her.
i think that she is a fast learner.
cons, she does not always follow through.
sh-new york and the whole art school thing.
and roy.
she has a weird voice.
i do not need to tell you that.
i do not think you are being totally impartial though, because you have not said one bad thing about pam.
okay.
so be it, then you have lost credibility.
and I am going to go with my guy, and that is ryan.
oh, wow!
whoa!
ho-ho, man!
wow.
honey!
i want you to bring the garbage out.
because I am not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba- i have a very difficult decision to make.
it is like last week i was at the video store.
do i rent devil wears prada again?
or do i finally get around to seeing sophie's choice?
it is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
pam, can you come in here, please?
have a seat.
well, there is no easy way of saying this.
so i think i will just...drag it out.
since the dawn of time there has been- i gave ryan the sales job.
there just were not enough clients for the two of you.
so i had to- I am sorry, sorry.
yes, you did.
yep.
no, you-no.
no, you are the best person for the job.
you are going to be great.
oh, oh!
you should have seen your face.
oh man!
oh, that was classic.
oh, really?
oh, man.
that was really good.
that was really good.
i do not know, i offered him his temp job back.
we will see.
he was not happy at all when i offered him this job and then i told him he did not get the job, so- i do not appreciate you telling me what to do.
so clean out your desk, you are through here.
oh!
what is our receptionists name?
could you send her in?
hello.
have a seat.
this is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.
hank, could you come up here please?
hank is our security guard- he will be ushering you out.
oh, your face!
oh!
no, I am kidding.
no, you are not-you are not fired.
yet.
oh... i do not know, actually.
oh, no.
i still have the lease on the michael scott paper company, so occasionally i will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing.
i actually dance all the time.
tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet.
when i am breaking all the rules, i am break dancing.
and expresso.
guys, I am scared.
I am really scared.
i think I am growing into a giant.
because look at this normal sized coffee cup.
looks so tiny in my giant hand now.
anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
okay.
how about a woman?
pam?
oh, really?
ok. what about the rest of you?
at dunder-mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and i do not know who instituted it.
i think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the michael scott paper company i really enjoyed having lunch with pam and ryan everyday.
so, rules be damned, i want to have lunch with these people.
who else?
who else?
ryan?
ok. anyone?
anyone?
at all?
accounting?
i am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
what?
ugh!
god!
what happened to you people?
we are just office drones.
we are office drones.
all we do is work... is work.
i... was just learning... to... love.
no work.
no work.
no work.
i come in here to release frustration.
ooh.
ah.
ah.
ah.
ooh.
that is good.
if you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so... come on in.
hey, hey, hey.
here we go.
here we go.
yeah.
now you got it.
now you got it.
hey, you want some espresso?
you got to keep yourself dehydrated.
ok. i love it.
i love it.
i love it.
guys, i believe that i have figured out what is up your butts.
there is no reason to be scared.
the bad man is gone.charles is gone.
charles really did a number on these guys.
they are way too focused on work.
when i was in charge, this place was like dave and buster's people just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps.
i do not know.
it is like  dave died or something.
daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
i am your big daddy and i am going to kiss da boo boo.
andy's afwaid?
are you all afwaid?
daddy's here for you.
my wittle angels.
ok. i think that i have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
funk is the problem and the solution.
I have taken my downstairs office and i have turned it into a place to hang out.
a place where unattractive and attractive people can get together.
to meet.
to greet.
to see the ones that you love.
to love the ones that you see.
why do not you get over lunch, oscar?
everybody else is past it.
no.
dwight is confusing you.
that - it is, it is more of a disco.
... with coffee but without the haunted.
it is a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
exactly.
wha - no.
no.
not even close.
i can not force you to go down but i can entice you.
I am going to be down there.
erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
well, kevin, i guess it is just me and you.
holdin' down the fort.
thank you.
this is a no work zone.
please respect the lei.
kevin, stay.
kevin, stay.
stay, stay.
cookie.
kevin, cookie.
mmm-hmm.
come on.
now i know what the founders of phillip-morris felt like.
you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you are just some terrible monster.
phyllis?
hey!
alright.
back.
there you are.
there you go.
good.
good.
ooh.
show me some attitude.
oh, god!
no!
no!
no!
no!
no!
oh, wow!
what did you do?
you did not do that.
you are ok. you are ok. let us lie down.
you want to go down?
alright.
ok. that is ok. that is not a problem.
ok, sweetie.
no.
no.
no.
it is her back.
we just - we need - let us - you know what?
we are going to take care of you.
we are going to get you help.
let us - come on.
oh, no.
no.
no.
this is no good.
i do not need you to give me a history lesson.
ok?
it is just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor.
wait, wait, wait.
but most importantly we need to get her some medical attention.
as soon as possible.
stat.
alright.
here we go.
you having fun?
what?
oh, just having to much fun.
phyllis, we are going to put you in here.
dwight's going to take care of you.
ok, dwight.
ok. good.
i do not want anyone to worry.
oh, you know.
nohting.
she is  - we were hanging out at cafe disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury.
but she is a tough, old bird.
so... ok. phyllis did injure herself.
but she injured herself having fun and i do not think she would trade that memory for anything.
you all took a life here today.
you did.
the life of the party.
erin?
i want you to go downstairs and i want you to shut it down.
i do not care.
bury it.
i hope you are happy.
i guess they got what they want.
i am eating alone.
might as well be dinner.
cafe disco is dead but i can still hear the music in my head.
it is better than i imagined it!
welcome, welcome!
cafe disco.
i am michael scott.
angela.
angela.
angela.
may i interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
oh.
alright.
there you go.
no.
no.
no.
here is the deal - one signature for every song.
i know.
i know, angela.
a lot of people doubted cafe disco at first but it is a magical place.
you have to give it a chance.
if these walls could tale they would say, " this is a magical place!
you are safe here.
we have talking walls.
we are not going to eat you."  no.
hey, thank you, creed.
you are really getting this place.
hey!
hey!
angela, no!
no cleaning up!
no... cleaning... up.
hey!
hey!
jim and pam!
can you believe this?
it is really happening.
you guys are the best for coming.
you do not have to stay if you do not want to.
i understand.
really?
oh, no.
not me.
not me.
get out of here.
cafe disco!
hey!
come on, man.
it is not even to "y".
would you like to dance?
my grandpa was the funnest guy i ever knew.
he would sing.
he would dance.
he would....fall down.
but then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed.
he...stopped going out at night.
he got a job.
the fun just dried up.
it was really sad.
i do not want that to happen to you guys.
I am not going to let it happen.
uh oh.
what is so funny?
oh yay!
geography joke.
oh!
wow!
okay.
alright, let us all go home.
come on.
see you all tamale.
see you later!
we are just friends.
hey, hey, wait a second.
who let you in here, is what i want to know.
mmhmm.
yeah, that is right.
all right.
mmhmm.
hey.
a little bit.
uh, i meet a lot of people.
hey.
arrggh.
so would you guys like some lemonade?
or one of you?
or both of you?
either or.
the combinations are endless.
okay.
you can go to hell.
I am kidding.
um, sure, i will get you the best iced tea in the world.
i lied to kevin.
holly and i can never be just friends.
i wrote down a list of bullet points why holly and i should be together, and I am going to find the perfect moment today and i am going to tell her.
number one: "holly, you and i are soup snakes." the-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that does not make any sense.
we are soul mates.
holly and i are soul mates.
what is up with you two, holly?
cool.
for who?
wow... I am designing a chair.
it is part of your pants.
you sit down, you are supported.
all right, fatty.
i will do it.
you know what, we should actually rehearse.
you bet your fat ass we are.
well, in his infinite wisdom, david wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of dunder mifflin.
that is right.
newspapers for sale!
i brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
what?
um, no, i just thought we would wing it.
that cool?
we could do a movie... sort of thing.
oh!
could we get a delorean?
oh!
dun-der.
dun-der... dun-der.
dun-der.
dun-der.
dun-der.
blooo!!
no.
no.
we are circling it.
uh, it is a sketch now.
and now, presenting...  yes, i am.
ohh, I am thinking... I am going to say... b, tour of dartmouth college.
ahhhh!!
ohhh!!
ahhh!!
i was there!
ahhh!!
i was a tour guide at dartmouth college!!
noooo!!!
yeah, I am definitely getting in.
I am a shoo-in.
I am robert mifflin.
ah, okay.
two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I have ever seen in my life.
i will say, c, a gun.
he shot himself in the head.
yes!
i will say b, buffalo!
final answer!
david wallace told me!!
i guess not.
well... i did not know they did not know.
thank you.
well, he is just thinking about his own gifts.
probably should not have mentioned buffalo.
should have had hindsight.
i think it went well.
i think it was good.
no, it was a tough audience.
believe me, i have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
me too.
we have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
well you guys should hit the road before... i close down another branch.
good to see you.
aj.
i did not find a perfect moment, because i think that today was just about just having today.
and i think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other.
i will see her every now and then, and... maybe one year she will be with somebody, and the next year, I will be with somebody, and it is going to take a long time... and then it is perfect.
I am in no rush.
parkour!
okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
parkoooooour!
who is getting married?
if somebody does not tell me, I am going to start screaming.
oh!
hey, i hired them!
matchmaker!
this place is like spaniard fly.
did everybody know about this but me?
okay... okay.
you will never guess what i know.
eric likes megan.
how do you know this?
i hate, hate, hate being left out.
whether it is not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team does not exist.
or that the sport does not exist?
i should have known.
poopball?
man, i know how you feel.
third wheel.
i have been the third wheel so many times in my life.
my mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better.
she said "the third wheel is what makes it a tricycle." I am talking about your group date with megan and eric.
yes well... stanley was on your group date?
does anybody else know about this?
there he goes.
there he goes.
so, what is the scuttlebutt?
anybody hear anything?
nothing?
well i got a little something something.
i do not know if i should say... stanly is having a midlife crisis.
well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
who?
you stupid son of a bitch.
you set me up.
stanley's wife is out of town.
oh, was he?
well who, his sister?
i do not get it!
drugs?
mmm... okay.
uhh... hmm... okay.
never mind.
carry on.
stanley is having an affir.
i am very happy right now.
thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation.
when you have somebody is attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say,  that is a great feeling, and i experienced that firsthand today.
it is wonderful to be the center of attention.
that and that are the same letter.
no... no.
he is holding a pencil.
he could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil.
what is that letter, right there?
same letter here and here.
what have not you guessed?
t!
yes!
yes!
that is a "t", and there is another one right there.
just sound that out.
you are almost there.
hey, stanley!
where you going, big guy?
up to no good?
no, no, no, no.
i just had a quick question for you.
I am casting a movie and I am looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman.
do you know anybody?
pays five million dollars.
nudity required.
did you hear stanley's having an affair?
oh, okay, i get it.
you feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it is really sad because everybody thinks you are a loser...  stop.
hold up, hold up, hold up!
no, no, no.
time to stop being polite and get real.
stanley, are you having an affair?
so it is not true.
okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
so stupid!
i know, i know.
oh, i bet.
wait, hold, hold, hold... so it is true?
oh my god!
wait a second, do people often say they are going on sales calls and then go someplace else?
because that is not cool.
I am not saying... a damn thing.
you can count on me.
oh, that smells good.
did you hear about angela?
that is pretty weird.
well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire.
owns a quizno's on the turnpike.
uh huh.
alright?
how do you un-tell something?
you can not.
you can not put words back in your mouth.
what you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that is been said is untrue, including "stanley is having an affair." it is like the end of spartacus.
I have seen that movie half a dozen times, and i still do not know who the real spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
yeah.
anorexia.
she is an anorexatic.
nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best i guess.
I am worried about erin, because she is not a very good worker.
i do not know how long she is going to last here.
yeah.
so... and andy is gay.
mm hmm.
did you hear pam is pregnant?
yeah!
guys, guys... you can not believe everything you hear.
like stanley, having an affair?
that is crazy!
it is just... there is no stalking it.
it is a weird day for false facts.
let it go.
okay everybody, big day.
last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe?
dwight, the honors.
yeah, yeah... you know what?
let us discredit these rumors.
that is not important, jim, i just think we should not listen to any of that crap.
nowhere.
okay, i made it all up.
yes.
but guys, I am a victim here too, okay?
people here have been saying that I am a j. crew model.
jim?
no, no.
i spread the rumor that somebody here was a j. crew model, and i was referring to myself.
because a lot of people think that models, even though they are very attractive, are somewhat vapid.
it is set our industry back quite a bit.
okay, okay... here is the thing.
there was one true rumor out there today.
i did not want everybody to know what it was.
so all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
the one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that... alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can not fall on the sword this way.
the real thing is that stanley hudson had an affair.
yes.
jim... look at that!
that is the inside of your vagina!
how long have you known about the pregnancy?
a week?
a month?
a year?
did you pee on a stick?
you should have told me.
oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town.
oh... oh god.
no, i have to take it, or it will seem suspicious.
no, no, i can do this.
yes, i can.
i am going to tell her that i need to redecorate my condo, and i need her help.
we will haggle about money, and then i will back down, and then i will not talk to her until this whole cynthia thing has blown over.
hey, what up, cynthia?
hold on a second, cynthia.
well, it turns out that teri was already suspicious, because she had caught stanley and cynthia a few months ago.
so stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story.
well, not exactly.
uhh, cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him.
oh, and get this.
cynthia, also married.
so... you can not stop love, i guess  and quite frankly, i do not think you should ever try.
yeah?
yes, oscar come on in.
close the door if you would.
thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.
I am going in for a procedure today.
yeah, it is routine.
I am just a little bit scared.
it is a colonoscopy.
in your experience, what should i be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?
is there anything i can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for dr. shaundry?
my main concern, should i have a safe word?
abso... you know what?
I will do you one better, sunday, sunday night.
ho, hol, hold on big guy, I am going to put it in the mail sunday night and you will get it weds.
oh right, this thing.
i remember now.
what is this about?
it is okay with me but he is going to want me in there.
really?
alright, do you mind if it sit this out?
i have so much work to do, i feel like I am going to blow my brains out.
am i worried that jim and david are having a meeting without me?
no, because we are the three amigos.
and once in awhile one of the amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.
hey let me escort you to your desk.
you and jim are close, huh?
hey, what do you think he and david are talking about?
what do you... well, you said good luck to jim as he walked in.
if you are lying to me right now pam, your baby is going to come out a liar.
that is how it works.
they inherit things through the breast milk.
i just do not want you to lie to me.
i do not want you to ever lie to me.
have i ever lied to you?
i just do not want you to.
uh huh, well if he does not like it you can tell that sob that he is fired.
sorry, I am going into a meeting right now.
i will... i love you too.
bye.
sorry about that.
what did i miss?
do not mind!
yes, i do!
no, i do not.
yes, i do!
no, i do not mind.
catch you guys on the flippity flop.
oh this... call waiting.
yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the mayor he just lost six votes.
yeah.
nope.
no, i think they are talking about me.
what is jim telling him?
that i can not handle this job?
that 's bull crap.
that is bull crap.
although, it has been chaotic lately.
corporate shut down the buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.
i will tell you there has been work everyday.
had to come in on a saturday.
to retrieve... i left my cell phone here.
how are your sales doing?
shhh, I am just trying to figure out what is going on in that room, okay?
wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I am completely overwhelmed.
you know when they say it is so crazy it just might work?
well, i do not believe that.
i say go for the air-tight plan and that is why i am having andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.
it is just elegant.
be my eyes.
hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.
how you doing?
yes, definitely.
look who you are talking to.
well i would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
permission to speak on the record?
jim is like big bird.
he is tall and yellow and very nice.
but would i put him in charge?
no, i do not think so.
because big bird does not make the tough decisions.
i... if i was going to put someone in charge, i would put burt in charge or i would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like maria or gordon, maybe.
very much, jim is my best friend.
but it is his performance report... right here.
now this was written by toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
david it is not very well written, but you get the gist.
i can just continue to run it myself.
this was jim's idea?
wow.
ummm, well I would have to talk to my mother and my guy at h and r block.
i can not help but feel partially responsible.
little pick me up?
oh those are the best.
little sugar rush.
well we did talk about how handsome you are.
oh what a week, god.
we said... i know there were certain things we said... hmmm, that is weird, that is weird... it is kind of weirding me out.
did you know that lincoln's secretary was named kennedy.
tell you what, when you leave this office i am going to call wallace and i am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
yes!
yes.
hey david, this is michael scott.
michael scott here.
just wanted to talk to you about  jim halpert.
i understand that he did not receive the promotion.
and i wanted to see what i could do to nudge you in the right direction.
wha... here is the thing, jim is the best man for this job, i think you should give it to him.
well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.
that file had been falsified.
toby flenderson is doing drugs.
hey, hey jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.
alright,  just do it.
i never recommended you because i did not want to lose you and i did not want to lose pam,  and now i do not want to lose the baby.
that is what she... kind of in the middle of something here.
i, yeah... no, I will tell him myself.
let us both.
hello.
no, it is just us.
oh, oh, well here he is right now.
come in.
well just as long as it means jim becomes a manager.
i like that, so manager and co-manager.
well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
okay everybody, i have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?
everybody, david wallace and i have talked and we have decided to promote jim to the position of co-manager.
of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the scranton branch butts.
what is happening to me?
i am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.
jim halpert, welcome.
no way, no how.
expense reports are a day-to-day item.
that is jim's now.
i am exclusively big picture, epic.
that is not big picture.
... okay.
that is not- okay- that is day-to-day.
you are trying to trick me.
get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I would like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes.
and i suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.
yes?
mmm, sure, but could i first talk to you in my office?
welcome.
mm-hmm.
disruptive.
no, i do not think they are.
i think the meetings are very important.
let us do.
n- well, to be fair, jim... james... jimothy... to be fair, jimothy, the- ah, that sounds weird.
are you okay with being called jim?
alright.
jim, to be fair, the conversation was not about planets... at first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper.
and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon?
so you draw a line from there to the other planets, and i think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.
because it is a big universe, and we are all just little, tiny specks of dust.
you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps.
you go to sleep, it is light out, you wake up, it is dark.
that is the whole day.
where did that day go?
i have no idea.
yes.
alright.
no more meetings this week.
i can be very suprising.
mm-hmm?
yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks.
got one of each.
stanley, you do not need to answer that.
what do you mean by "these people"?
oh, hey, everybody, i think that jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
listen, jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what i want is more important that what you want.
what do you guys think?
no, no, no, you do not need to go anywhere.
anything that jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
that is not what wallace told us.
that is not the way i heard it.
it is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title.
it is another thing, you bossing me around.
no, no, no.
no, we will not call david wallace.
i will call david wallace.
or david wallace will call us on line two.
why do not we just- hey david, this is michael, senior co-manager.
got it, dave.
sounds like your classice big-picture decision.
which is it more of?
i thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
no, it will not be.
i am on top of it.
talk to you later-  okay, you did not let me say good-bye.
alright, i am looking forward to this.
i hate the fact that we have to do this together.
i think we work better separately.
when i am irritated and i look at you, i do not see you anymore.
all i can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
you know, there is no easy way to do this.
i say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and do not say anything about it.
no, we can do it during the day.
it does not have to be that dramatic, jim.
jim, do not take this the wrong way.
are you going to take this the wrong way?
you use your brain too much.
sometimes the smartest people do not think at all.
as i was saying it.
con- you look like a nerd.
pro- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
con- you unzip your pants, and you find that there is a calculator down there.
that will not go over well.
oh, my god!
are you going to make another pro and con list?
I am going to kill myself.
no!
i could not do that, jim.
i can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect.
if i can just think this through, if i could just think it exactly right, i can make this perfect, and then i can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.
and then another- oh, i do?!
tell me what they are.
ha!
that- i am not known for that!
yes!
you went over my head to wallace!
okay.
well, why do not you tell me what those are, jim?
why do not you enliven me?
ah.
okay, here is a tough decision for you.
you suck!
you suck!
is that clear enough for you?!
okay, skippy, here we go.
why do not you run yourself out there and tell them?
you call it.
this had better be terrible.
that was good!
that was good!
okay, all right.
well, we all know it is hard to be a boss, right?
you know what?
look around you.
these are your best friends.
these are the people who will open their hearts to you.
they all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift.
so in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts.
angela, yes, lend oscar a cup of sugar.
this- my plan- a man- panama.
alright!
let me get this clear!
does everybody want a raise?
alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we are going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
what about a raise based on merit?
mm-hmm.
piece of cake.
ryan, obviously the best.
are you making a- toby.
just wanted to draw a picture of him.
alright!
who to pick?
who to pick?
i... will skip a turn.
i need more time.
hey, what are you guys doing in here?
how you doing?
oh, what are you usually?
usually a ten, but I am feeling like a zero.
i know, i know.
yes, we did.
um, nothing.
i just... i used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst.
i have something i would like to give you.
you are welcome.
gin.
just pretend we are not here.
what do you think?
i spent all morning on it.
it is just a really important day for me.
thanks.
yes she does.
yes she does.
we are all going to go and we are going to have a good time.
no.
and, hey, do not embarrass me when we go to niagara.
do not.
do not.
do not.
you stole my joke.
do not steal my joke.
yes.
i said that yesterday.
dwight... no.
no.
no.
please, please.
dwight, that is my joke.
this is what I am talking about.
when we leave here and go up to niagara falls we are representing dunder mifflin, everyone.
this is a very important wedding for the branch.
the most important wedding until i get married.
so, i want you all on your best behavior or so help me, god.
so... i will see you up there in viagra falls!
pam and jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
get out of here.
oh, my god, dwight.
there is... a name.
oh.
well, tell me about jocelyn.
is that all you have on her?
you are an idiot.
oh!
god!
wow!
oh.
i was asleep.
those glasses are super dark.
alright.
we need some tunes, i think.
you did?
that was nice of you.
oh, very thoughtful.
a little mix to set the mood.
delightful.
pop that in.
are you serious?
you want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
no.
no.
that is not how it works.
hello.
reservation for michael scott.
mmm-hmm.
i do not have a reservation but i want a room in the halpert-beesly block of rooms.
dwight.
dwight, dwight.
i need to stay in your room.
I am staying in your-  come on, dwight.
i would do the same for you.
yes.
yes... just go- oh.
thank god.
um... no.
and you know what?
i would say yes but you can not.
and I will tell you why.
if i have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she is going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
ok. i do not have a room?
ok. 'oooh.
you must pass the dungeon wisdom test.' jerk.
when mary was denied a room at the inn... jesus was born.
when michael was denied a room at the inn, we do not know what happens because that story has not been told yet.
hey.
stanley?
can i stay in your room tonight?
not in the same bed.
in the other bed.
you... are... kidding me.
I am not a physics major, stanley.
I am just saying be careful.
hey, guys.
hey.
could i stay in your room tonight?
that is rude.
you are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
she is very conservative.
so, mum's the word.
how ya doing?
nice to meet you.
who is doing a toast?
i would like to go third.
sort of bat clean up and- that is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
did not move my lips.
head table, where i belong.
well, who is that one?
what am i supposed to do with that, dwight?
they have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong.
i would kill with the brother stuff.
it should be me... up there.
it should be me and pete, not pete and tom.
that is not appropriate.
hello.
hi, everybody.
i promised i was not going to make a toast and I am not going to.
just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to pam and jim, then so be it.
hey, what is the deal with the smart car?
how smart is that?
those things are tiny.
can you even drive them in traffic?
'I am so smart.
e=mc... squared.
i drive a smart car.' that is not smart in my book.
the real smart car is kitt from knight rider.
that is a car that can talk.
can smart car talk?
nope.
that is not smart.
and also, chitty chitty bang bang.
and... you... everybody can laugh.
it does not have to just be the idiots.
everybody can laugh.
yeah.
go ahead.
ok. ok. hey.
what i think jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what?
these two people, they are living together, they are having lots of consentual sex- yes.
yes they were living together.
yes and you know what?
you can not expect them to be careful every time.
because, frankly, it is just a different sensation.
when you c- well?
am i wrong?
they say it is not different, but it is a different sensation.
when you use something to block- i think everybody knows what i am talking about.
it is not necessarily different for the woman- ...but it is different for the- ok. ok. alright.
my point is i said what i wanted to say and mema, i hope you heard every word.
jim.
that was a little touch and go at first but i think we saved it.
i know.
i can not believe it was you, either.
i actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
i have not found that to be the case.
can you believe it?
he screwed up, not me.
there is going to be a free room?
hi, mema.
it is michael.
yes.
yep.
one in the same.
may i?
i am actually great with old women.
in fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met harriet and now she thinks she is better than everybody.
oh.
ok. well... hook you up, there.
you are welcome.
oh.
is not he terrible?
may i?
here is the thing.
umm... mema, i think you just need to chill out about this whole pam getting pregnant thing.
it is not 1890 anymore.
it is modern day.
and women have sex before marriage and i think we need to celebrate that.
and i know in your day she would be considered a who are but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them.
that is part of life.
exactly.
i know.
they are going to name the baby after you, you know.
they are going to call it mema.
yes, and if it is a boy they will call it sylvio.
what are you wearing?
looks like you are going to a fish fry, dwight.
ok.  that is not appropriate.
uncool.
uncool, dwight.
ok. ok. come on.
let us go.
dwight, dwight.
shut up about the farm.
it is not relatable.
nobody owns a farm.
toy story, finding nemo, up.
i ball the entire time.
i can not watch pixar.
yes.
why?
oh, my god.
twins.
I am sorry.
you understand.
nice to meet you.
they are men, dwight.
something is wrong with you.
is that pam?
hey, have her come out!
have her come out!
it would be like coyote ugly.
i love you!
mmm!
it is after midnight.
oh my god.
you are not going to be able to talk back.
she will be sitting home saying, "jim... take the baby to the zoo because i want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."   "and... and clip my toenails." now you sound like kermit.
why do not you take a picture.
it will last longer.
god.
can not i get a little privacy?
hey, good morning.
it is about damn time.
i have not gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.
oh my god, dwight.
this room is a pit.
how can you eat like that?
yeah, I am hungry, but I am not going to make a pig out of myself.
she was cute.
you know?
she was hot.
she was very hot.
she made love like a tiger.
she was from europe.
uh-huh.
no.
wait a second.
you are not into her?
are you kidding me?
she is pam's best friend.
you guys could double date.
swap maybe?
no... you are crazy.
she is- okay.
do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?
you have to take x-rays.
you have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth.
you have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they are not scared when the dentist comes in.
it- it- i already have my european girlfriend.
oh, here we go.
they asked for cash, but you know... i give them cash every week, so- how much cash does a person need?
i have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.
i have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.
and i have another one of them in the nude.
but that one is for me.
hey, hey... he is not sitting with me either.
where are you sitting?
you need a seat buddy?
oh, i wish i was a bridesmaid.
where am i going to go?
hey.
hi.
do you-would you have a snack in your purse?
you are a mom.
i just figured you might have- oh!
eww... apricot.
do you have any of the very berry or ocean splash or- oh... okay.
were you saving it?
I am sorry.
ugh.
apricot.
made of real apes.
my weekend was bad so far.
i came here hoping to meet somebody.
you know, as you do at weddings.
end up going to sleep by the vending machine.
it was loud, but it was warm.
and... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
it is a terrible year for love.
I am thinking about having my sperm frozen.
oh, wow.
that sounds hilarious.
i do actually.
there you go.
use it in good health.
yes!
yes!
i have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.
how do i look?
hey pam, did you see this?
it was on you tube.
the fundamentals of business.
the funda-mentals of business.
"mental" is part of the word, i have underlined it.
because you are mental, if you do not have a good time.
you have to enjoy it.
get out.
yes.
so, it all starts with a handshake.
but you can not just go right to the selling, you need "small talk."  what topics can you use for small talk?
mmhm.
mmhm.
yes, what else?
no.
yeah!
that is good!
come on up!
meredith, come up here.
let us do a little something.
so meredith and i have just started conversing and i will say, "so meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?" all right... okay, okay.
god.
what you people do not know about business, i could fill a book with.
what?
the fundamentals of business by michael scott.
over one billion sold.
more than the bible, I am not surprised.
chapter one.
the businessman... oh hi.
I am sorry, just a sec.
erin, you are supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
do you know how creative space works?
okay i just cancelled my afternoon.
push free play til tomorrow morning.
hi.
sorry.
crazy day.
you are seeing how the sausage gets made.
come in the conference room and i will show you a finished sausage.
mmhm.
yep.
okay.
there is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman.
it is like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
oh yup.
yeah, definitely.
all that paper burning up.
mmhm, i hear you.
the truck.
okay, well.
do your worst.
oh, great.
mmhm.
nothing, other than once again, i am just thankful that i am a paper salesman.
no dwight, not everything is a threat.
there is no such things as monsters.
wait, when did we start talking about the mob?
the guy was trying to sell me insurance.
i think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
he did talk about a fire in the warehouse...  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
hey, hey hey, calm down.
calm down.
calm down.
ryan, you lived in new york, what do you think?
okay.
um it is, grotti.
okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
I am not going to lock my door.
it is grotti.
he is following up.
"i feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business." yeah.
yeah.
what are my options here?
do i just ignore it, or?
okay, I am calling the police.
all right.
shh!
that is not going to happen.
what am i supposed to do here?
i was thinking exactly the same thing.
i do not know, i do not know about that.
hold on, hold on!
just- all right.
i will meet with him, but I am not going alone.
what are you wearing?
who is pat?
let us go, come on.
god!
forget it!
forget it!
take that thing off the table!
please!
oh my god!
guys, guys.
cool it.
there he is, there he is.
hello.
mr. grotti we meet again.
these are my associates.
yes.
well.
okay.
that is not true.
okay shut up.
i will have the gabba-gool.
the gabba-gool.
i do not, i do not have to have that.
guys, guys- that is okay.
shh.
i will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
if the salad is on top, i send it back.
i do not think our company actually needs any more insurance.
so i am out.
no, no no, no.
come on.
I am sorry, we are having our salad.
hey, do you need any help?
he is a good mechanic.
i do not... okay, okay okay.
yep, all right.
put it down.
okay.
okay.
it is just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
i had to make a snap decision dwight.
it was a lot of snap decisions.
yes!
just get in the car.
jim?
oh thank god.
it was not easy.
i had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency.
i chose massive coronary, because you told me that your dad had a bad heart.
listen man, i, i got a problem, i think I am in trouble with the mob.
or a major insurance carrier.
yeah, i know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I am turning to you my friend.
okay!
jim?
are you?
what?
wait, i did not hear a thing you just said.
no!
god!
i missed, i missed the important part again!
no!
oh my god!
no, jim please, repeat what you are saying!
i can not understand you!
jim?!?
oh my god.
hey uh, question for you.
i recently purchased some insurance that i can not afford given my present salary.
is there anything accounting-wise i can do to sort of make it all go away?
oh no.
um.
what about this cash for clunkers thing?
all right.
well, it was a thought.
thanks.
no.
he is not.
he is just good.
nothing sticks to him.
you still do not understand how this works.
but grotti acts like he is mafia though.
if there is one thing i hate more than the mafia it is a liar.
i wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars.
bury them in my yard.
and i would not tell the cops a thing.
not that i would be lying per se.
but i would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
this is scott.
oh really?
is that supposed to scare me?
well you thought wrong.
because i am not pleased.
I am actually kind of po'd.
i think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
i think you knew exactly what you were doing.
and frankly i think you were being a total and utter jerk.
you suck!
and I am not going to buy your stupid insurance.
how about that?
the only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
doubt it.
what a tool.
what?
no.
what do you mean?
what?
oh man.
i should be mad at you guys.
but I am not.
so i looked him in the eye and i said, "not today grotti, not today.
and not tomorrow, and not the next day.
or the day after that.
and you can tell all your friends that if i see them, then they are already dead." i said something like that.
erin?
coffee?
not from the kitchen.
stop and shop.
if it is not stop and shop, i send it back.
large.
if it is a medium i send it back.
if it is an extra large i send it back.
go.
any questions?
is there someone there?
who is there?
i hear voices, is somebody there?
is someone there?
i can not see you because I am blind.
it is?
they are back?
oh!
oh!
oh, pam!
and oh, jim... oh, i have not see you since my accident that i had when i fell- i fell into the pool of acid, eyes first.
blind guy.
blind-guy mcsqueezy.
how do i describe it?
it is a character I have been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble.
the women in my improve class absolutely hate him.
i have recently taken a lover.
pam's mom.
pam's mom, helene.
remember from your wedding?
about what?
oh, big time.
she drives a green camry.
and the seats go all the way down.
all the way down.
what?
okay, good, a pact.
a pact.
although i may have to break it tonight when helene and i tell pam over dinner.
you alright?
get the hell out of here, idiot.
i think you are underestimating pam.
i think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
okay, i have a good thing with the mom- she is right on my way home from work.
i di- alright, I will take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world i would want to do is upset pam.
yeah.
can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
sure.
thanks for asking.
oh, wow.
that is amazing.
i feel like a real puerto rican.
erin, look.
yeah.
yeah, no, it is nobody.
hmm... no.
i do not.
i do not deserve this, guys.
no, i do not.
i was probably going to break up with her anyway.
pam, it is very complicated.
there are a lot of moving parts here.
it is.
you want me to be happy?
part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
more than a friend, a co-worker.
it is okay.
that could have gone one of two ways, but i never expected her to get upset.
okay.
feels good.
I am sleeping with pam's mom.
sometimes, dinner.
due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
that was a hit job.
if you read the dunder mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.
so if there is a lesson to be learned here and I am not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.
who wants to help the world one step at a time?
alright, good.
alright, that is... alright... okay, I am out of here,  see you later guys... ok, oh no here is an idea... conservation... anybody else?
who else has an idea?
can you hold down the fort?
hey boo!
what is it... why are you crying?
no, no, no, I will talk to her.
i will... no... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I will let you know how it goes.
alright, by pickle.
pamela morgan beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
for trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
alright, in my defense... shut up oscar.
hey, alright, you know what, clearly I am outnumbered here, but can i just say one thing, please?
what is so wrong about me?
I am caring, I am generous, I am sensual.
is it really so horrible that i could possibly go out and find happiness.
let us get back to the matter at hand.
no, no, no... no, no... i do not like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
do not talk to me that way!
i am your boss and i may someday be your father, so get out.
i hope that you are willing to die in this office, because i am... hey toby, could i talk to you for a minute?
um, i just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I am sorry.
can i sit down for a second?
this is going to sound weird, but i think i may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole pam situation.
she brought it into the work place so i feel like it has to be dealt with here.
really?
would you do that?
you are a good, good guy.
no... that is... i do not... um... i can not hear your conversation.
yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you are a jackass.
hey, hey, you know what?
you are just as stubborn as your mother, when you do not want to do something you just do not do it.
you were right jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.
okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?
is that how we are going to get past this?
because, i will.
well, that is not going to happen!
because i assumed that you want me to be happy because i want you to be happy.
you know what?
I am going to start dating her even harder.
you know what it means.
i do not need to be friends with pam.
i have plenty of female friends.
my mom, pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on I am, what is her face from quiznos, i see her four times a week.
night everyone.
night pam, thanks again for the rum.
night erin.
welcome children of the scranton industrial park community.
join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom.
do not worry about a thing.
rest assured you will see me later.
bwah ha ha...   ... ha ha ha.
i am going to scare these kids so bad.
kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer.
alright?
why is christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
it is the easy way out.
you are not alone.
who wants candy?
...and then i think I am going to go to the garlic festival.
sounds like fun.
you guys would love it.
they have a tcby booth.
the same stuff you get downtown.
do you like tcby?
i can not believe it is- i can not believe it is yogurt.
uh... it will be fun you should give them a call.
check that out.
jim's a good kid.
he can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master.
i, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
wha- what?
why do not they just want you to go by yourself?
why do they want me to come, too?
i do not understand.
i do not want you to feel like I am baby-sitting you, or something.
alright.
let me get your stroller.
what are you going to call him?
no.
what is his name?
mr. bourchard.
they are very formal.
yeah, well... this is not the phone.
this is real life, baby, and you got to own it.
is that what you are wearing?
...and that is the watch that you are going to wear?
no.
it is not.
you should wear this watch.
i will loan it to you.
it is a tankard.
i highly recommend you wear that.
they are into style.
they are into appearance.
we are selling success.
that is sorta secondary.
alright.
hi.
any messages?
uh, well, jim and i got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
it was.
it was.
and then in an instant it was not.
it rained.
nothing.
cocoa.
good.
yep.
ok. thank you.
yeah?
ok. put them on speaker.
hey guys, what is going on?
uh... i can not really hear you.
i think we have sort of a bad connection.
it was- ok. this is what it was.
it was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
no.
maybe i was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
not yet!
no it is- do not!
I am not going to bump.
I am not going to bump.
and it was not hilarious.
it was very, very terrifying.
erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
oh.
he did?
what did he say?
ok. thank you, stanley.
ok. yes.
i can name pixar movies, too.
toy story.
i know what a flounder is.
I am not usually the butt of the joke.
I am usually the face of the joke.
i wish jim had fallen into that pond and he would have to put on my suit and it would be too short and he would look... damn it!
he would still look good.
the most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret.
show of hands- who has been 'koi-ponded'?
who here is been the butt of a joke that has gone too far?
phyllis?
uh... you never said anything.
well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'stop because i want you to stop' or stop as in 'stop.
you are making me laugh so hard.
what you are doing is so funny.
you are on a roll.
i am busting a gut.
stop!' we are going to make a 'do not mock' list.
ok?
anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list.
anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about.
got it?
I am going to kick it off.
let us see what i have to put on the list, right?
ok. i also have fallen into the fountain at the steamtown mall.
ok. who else?
who else?
dwight, come on.
your nose?
alright.
no.
i have not finished writing.
did you sneeze it off?
that is it.
no more.
ok. who else?
who else?
everybody's getting their chance.
ok. that is to broad.
it is got to be something else.
how 'bout your stomach?
yeah?
meredith?
ok. fine.
come on up here.
write it yourself.
and do not sign your name to it.
and nobody look.
everybody look away.
look away.
ok. it is a fish.
it could have died of natural causes.
so... do not mock, oscar.
do not mock.
how much do they want?
what?
no.
i could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
no, no.
no.
we are not done here.
this- no, jim.
you do not understand.
things like this do not just die.
kids in high school still call me 'ponytail'.
yes, they do, jim.
because of the time i got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
i want to make fun of you right now.
no.
do not do that.
you are not.
you are not stupid.
oh, my god.
hey.
i- i just want to say that i cannot believe that i walked into a koi pond.
i mean, seriously.
walk much?
oh.
i should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that i go to.
well, you know what?
you are right, phyllis, but I have been there before.
I have seen that pond.
this is the thing, i am a world class moron.
that is the problem.
it is ok. we are having fun.
it is not actually the first time I have been embarrassed by a pond.
in high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake.
four years in a row.
oh... it was freezing.
no.
no.
no.
oh, this is even worse.
couple weeks ago i went to get a new cellphone and i wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'who are your 5 friends?' and I am, like, 'uh... ' i did not even know i could not even think.
oh, my god.
it was so embarrassing.
that was- oh.
i do not even have jan's cell phone number and i hate her!
she will not give it to me.
i was like, 'oh, i guess I am a loser.
'a luh-whooooo a za her'.
too far!
god!
thanks a lot, man.
thanks for the advice.
hey.
who wants to watch michael's pond dive?
my roommate's friend is the night janitor over there.
he swiped the security tape for me and he is bringing it over.
is this the tape of me falling?
no.
it is ok. watch it.
he can not fire all of you.
it is alright.
i can handle it.
i am a grown-up, jim.
i do not think you froze.
jim is jealous of me?
jim is jealous of me.
oscar's a douche.
no.
he is a- yeah, he is alright.
ok. you are welcome.
whoa!
almost fell.
morning dwight.
no.
i had a fish stick sandwich.
actually i had two fish stick sandwiches.
my girlfriend did not want hers.
because i guess I am the only aphrodisiac she needs.
well, yeah... it worked.
i do not mind if i do.
I am taking one for my lady friend.
brain food.
thank you very much.
my girls.
there they are.
birthday lunch.
birthday lunch- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.
it will cure all of your "gee i do not know if michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "i do not really see them together".
so, open wide pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.
take with food.
yeah- i think everyone has meet helene.
shall we?
no, that would not be- yeah.
the rest of the story has been censored due to- inappropriosity.
hey- please, kevin.
you are fired.
sorry, sorry.
work with a bunch of idiots.
shall we go?
just want you to succeed pammy.
you know what, we should not even be talking about business today.
today is about family.
hello.
scott.
table for four.
what table should we take?
so many to choose from.
what?
all i see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.
oh, wait a second!
you mean this one?
wow!
not about taking credit.
let us just say we all did it.
well, it was actually me alone, so- wow look at this place.
really makes me want to go to italy some day.
oh.
thank you.
thanks for lending me the books.
that is funny.
you are 54 years old.
you are 58 years old?
congratulations.
the only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and i am not robbing the cradle.
if anything i am robbing the grave.
that- hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
helene?
i am.
I am definitely going to do it.
I have already got the run and the bike thing down.
just need to learn how to swim.
come on, you in?
so it is a matter of interest.
good, okay.
it is not anything you would have ever done.
well there is no jumping in a triathlon.
you are thinking of the broad jump.
would you try- bungee jumping?
snowboarding?
i might.
nothing.
just life- and doing things- before you die.
i do not know.
do i really want to go snowboarding?
no.
but i would like to if i wanted to.
so we should get the check?
oh, no, no, no.
no.
it is stupid.
you would hate it.
i hate it.
yes you will.
i literally- i put no thought into the wrapping at all.
might as well of been toilet paper.
that is just an arbitrary title.
it is not amazing... at all.
it is sort of weird that i went and did that.
and now your wish will not come true, so that blows.
oh that i plagiarized i think.
well, that is because you and i have very different tastes and you like lame things.
it is a generational- sort of gap between us.
that was a bunt.
oh, just went to the bathroom.
i got thirsty.
honestly, for a long time i thought i was going to grow old with holly.
and then i met helene.
and she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that i have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.
but, i think i want to do those things myself.
finish your cake, helene.
i want you to enjoy that cake because i have something terrible  i need to tell you.
i want you to enjoy your cake before i tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
helene i think you are a wonderful person and i- god- I have enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.
but i have to consider pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker i can not in good conscience continue to date you, when i know what this is doing to her.
no it is not.
wow.
that just- you have really grown.
thank you pam.
and i hope you are as gracious during this next part.
helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and i envy it.
and i want it someday, but just in the future.
you need somebody who- who understands your references.
who is kafkaesque?
I have never- i do not know him.
there is another woman.
and her name is italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
and i want kids.
and you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
it is not my decision.
it is mother nature.
and mother has very strict rules about fer-   -- tility.
well, hobbies- pamela beesly halpert- may i have a word with you in my office please?
well, this is a work related matter.
yes.
yes.
join me please, will not you?
i am going to give you a raise.
because of all the good work you have done.
that is- no, no- it is not about numbers, pam.
it is about attitude.
do you want the raise or what?
hey, pam, pam- with this raise there are strings attached.
and the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
no!
no- no i am not.
unless you want me to.
do you want me to?
because i will.
i will bribe you.
no.
your face is saying do not- unless i have not offered you enough... your face is not changing.
what is it?
talk to me face.
tell me what pam's brain is thinking.
come on!
what do you want?
what do you want?
do you want a million dollars?
do you want to hit me?
want me to get down on one knee and beg you or- what?
oh- okay , what?
i do not- are you kidding?
ye- no.
alright.
I will take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just- okay.
okay.
okay.
see you.
hey.
never.
about what?
a little- what are you talking- what punch?
I am pretty sure we said slap.
i- mmm- I am good.
hey.
do you and pam ever get frisky?
i mean- do you ever wrestle with each other?
really?
she strong?
can you stop this?
okay.
i do not either.
mmm-hmm.
i know.
you got to do something- how much time do you think you will need?
come on, man!
am i scared of getting hit in the face?
no.
everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.
I am scared I am going to love it.
let us do this.
it is okay guys... i can handle this.
everybody can go home.
you are just a bunch of voyeurs.
are you eating popcorn?
yes.
i know.
okay.
alright.
oh- god!
okay!
pam, pam- I am really sorry.
I am sorry.
so many things.
i do not know.
it is hard to choose.
maybe that- yes.
okay.
i promise.
for the record your mom came on to me.
no!
i do not know.
as i watched pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face i saw my entire life flash before my eyes.
and guess what?
i have four kids.
and i have a hover-car and a hover-house.
and my wife is a runner and it shows.
and pam and jim are my best friends and our kids play together.
and i am happy and i am rich and i never die.
it does not sound like much, but its enough for me.
ahh... oh thank you.
thanks.
i owe you one dwight.
no.
what are you talking about- forget that.
no.
oh that feels better.
but i would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
you did?
that sounds like it was hilarious.
yes?
you will have to be more specific dwight, i get like eight emails a day.
woo hoo, shout out!
erin, do we have the journal?
did you?
oh, the wall.
it is $1.99 to finish the article.
i wonder what it was going to say?
no, no, that does not make any sense.
oh, that sounds awful.
oh god.
well, that is an interesting theory.
ah, well maybe you should spy on him.
oh my god, would not that be hilarious!
ok, ok.  good.
I will catch you on the flippity flip.
bye.
he is busy, he will call me back when he is free.
no, I am just poopin'.
you know how i be.
crazy world.
lotta smells.
ok, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.
anything new on youtube?
does not even need to be good.
oh god, i can not think, need more mullins.
monkey see, monkey do.
monkey pee all over you.
we have a monthly staff meeting what?
oh my god!
there has been a murder.
there is been a murder in savannah.
games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.
battleship got me through my parents' divorce.
operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.
i do not think i would have been able to endure my breakup with holly had it not been for toss across.
it is so much fun.
everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it... this is my call jim, big picture stuff, it is about murder.
tube city, you owe me one.
there will be food.
you leave, you do not get food.
sandwich platters.
baby carrots.
ok, here are your character cards.
take one, pass it down.
here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.
now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.
everything else is up to your imagination.
so, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.
ok, use your imaginations.
it is not scary.
well how do you think i feel?
i mean i have to play caleb crawdad, handsome playboy.
every night, a different woman.
being oogled.
having to hug and kiss and spoon, i make them feel beautiful.
well, well, well.
what is this contraption, i do declare?
who is michael?
I am caleb crawdad, i do declare.
that is the way southern people talk.
delta burke, i do declare.
now, shall we get to the mystery?
no, no, no.
do not turn this into a political thing.
oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!
i do believe that the game is a big hit.
people are really diving into their characters.
sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
very good, very good.
now, no one was there in the wine cellar.
whoa.
what is this strange yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?
this here is savannah.
no no no no no no no.
I am going to skip forward to a relevant clue.
here we go.
are you going to believe that?
that is a mis- that is a misdirection.
we still do not know who the murderer is.
nellie nutmeg, come back in here.
i can not do this myself.
voodoo mama juju... what am i going to do?
i do believe you have me mistaken, my name is caleb crawdad.
you all skedaddled way too soon.
we need to reopen this case.
no it are not.
i already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
this is not a game, this is my life.
you are out of order, sir.
you are out of order.
you are- deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?
can not wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.
come on.
come on.
to mama juju boo boo.
because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
no michael here, my name is- no, you shut up.
they need this game, jim.
let us have this stupid little game, alright?
oh, you startled me.
my stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.
what can i do you for?
detective wallace?
aw, shucks, tell him I am not here.
no, i only answer to detective wallace because i got a warm body in the other room.
a murder, you say?
i do declare.
get in there!
there has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.
my little heart can barely take it no more.
today is the hardest i have worked in a long, long time.
on the count of three we are all going to put down our guns.
we will put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
one, two, three.. ok. ok. how 'bout this?
i want it to be better than 'great', pam.
how 'bout i remain seated... and i just do a little bit of a nod.
sort of a humble thing.
nope.
then my face is down.
they can not see my face.
alan brand is the ceo of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to new york to the shareholder's meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors.
and at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have.
and then michael scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
ok. obviously I am not going to do the twirl.
i only did it because i nailed the wave.
i am not going to do the twirl.
alright?
it is not even a twirl, it is a spin.
i might do the spin.
ok, oscar, i do not need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
well, could you condense it please?
it is not a limo.
it is a town car.
town cars are actually better, though.
better torque.
better handling.
they sent a limo.
town cars suck.
town car is something that a company sends when they are in trouble.
a limousine is something that a company sends when they have because for celebration.
and in this case i think we are celebrating me.
oh, wait.
wait.
wow.
wow!
oh, no way.
look at that.
hate to break it to you oscar but some of us like boobs.
hey, you know who you should be jealous of?
yourself.
because you are invited and you are invited and you are invited and you and you and you and you and you and you- what?
the limo seats eight.
ok. then jim and pam and ryan plus a guest.
mmm... whoa.
i wish the windows were not tinted so people could see us in here.
definitely.
definitely.
look they got pillows.
that.
that is bigger than my bed.
who is playing with the button?
i will have to answer.
no, no.
that is too hard.
say your name is zamboni and then i will say, 'well, we are sort of on thin ice.'  i will not say that.
I will something like that.
oh, my god.
this is it.
yes.
oh, hi.
well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me mr. scott.
well, i guess this is as far as i can take you guys.
so - see you later.
officers.
thank you.
thank you.
hello.
thank you.
oh.
it was awesome.
very, very sublime.
it is nice to meet you, too.
it is an honor and a privilege.
ah.
your eminence.
you guys ever protect the president?
what about madonna?
or obama twins?
anybody famous?
rock and roll.
this is not as much fun as i thought it would be.
we are going bankrupt, you think?
they are really angry.
hey, hey, hey.
I am sorry.
these are not criminals.
they are nice.
they invited me to come here today.
they invited me to their hospitality suite where i  had free food and it was delicious.
get this.
know how nice they are?
the sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in scranton.
that is - yes.
yeah, well, that is not going to happen.
that is not going to happen.
we will be back with some answers.
i - ok. i know that you are mad at me and you are mad at all them - ok. alright.
we are going to - we are going to go out there during this break and we are going to come back with a plan.
we are going to come back with a plan for you.
it is a 45 day plan.
45 days to get us back on track.
45 points.
it is a 45 day/45 point.
one point per day.
we get the 45 points we are back in business.
and you can take that to the bank.
and limo lady, we are going completely carbon neutral.
i love you, new york!
you.
you.
wow.
things are really picking up.
what?
i did wave.
i did a lot more than wave.
we tell them the plan, right?
here is what we are going to do.
the 45 day thing that i outlined, we go with that.
day 45, company saved.
day 44, go.
what do we got?
we have 15 minutes.
just whatever comes to mind.
shout it out.
i am the guy who roused that crowd.
got them on their feet.
they were so happy down there.
ok. alright.
well, i know a guy.
this mexican guy.
he is a math whiz.
he knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and i am going to call in a little favor.
well, I am texting him, so.
it is done.
oh.
there he is.
come on in.
come on in.
gentleman, i would like you to meet oscar.
come on in.
do not be shy.
this is oscar martinez.
oscar, why do not you come over here.
let me present you.
step up.
step up there.
oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation.
take it away.
tell them what you told me.
this is genius.
tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all - it is all good.
it is all good stuff.
lay it on them.
that was not what you were saying to me.
he was much more articulate and that was better.
much better.
of-kay.
oh... hey, hey.
what are you doing?
wow, man.
that - that was embarrassing.
for me, too.
you embarrassed me.
well, that was a waste of a text.
let us get down to brass tacks.
i think that we might be in trouble.
we do not seem to have a plan so I am thinking i go down there.
maybe rattle off a few jokes.
congressman could follow.
uh, I am not a moron.
time after time my branch leads in sales.
i have personally won over 17 dundie awards.
so, i am not a moron and i am just trying to help, you know?
so... you are the moron.
yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company.
to have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'wow.
great job.'  that is what it is all about.
not the perks.
perks?
the perks.
i could take or leave the perks.
limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan.
so we are leaving early.
after all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
oscar!
oscar!
come on!
there he is!
there he is!
go!
go!
go!
go!
go!
go!
go!
scranton!
scranton!
scranton!
dunder mifflin!
yeah, have a seat.
okay, right there is the problem.
there have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.
i have it on good authority that you said the following.
can you read that back to me?
mmm-hmm.
okay.
you are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "nummies," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widiculous," and "wode iwand." you can not be a baby in the office.
it makes me look like i hire babies.
okay, who said that?
well, thank you... thank you a lot.
and for what it is worth i think your baby voice is tops.
you are welcome, baby.
keep.
i want to keep those so i can see what i sent.
keep.
for what?
oh okay.
i do not know how those got on there... must be hackers.
what if i told you i had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
worse than that.
lurk much?
i miss pam.
is that what we are going for now?
"okay?"  we used to go for "pretty good." yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.
I am not in this for the trophies, but... well, technically, I am a co-manager, and i barely have any responsibilities, but i work hard, i love this company, and for those reasons, i think i would make a good employee of the month.
it would look good, on my mantle.
there you are.
i do not think we have finished with my inbox.
to change lives.
yeah, okay.
call the school, cancel.
i can not go through with this.
well... no.
i just, i fell in love with those kids.
and i did not want to see them fall victim to the system, so i made them a promise.
i told them that if they graduated from high school, i would pay for their college education.
I have made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.
just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?
I am not a bad person, i bring good news.
like when i promised those kids I would pay for college.
okay, all right.
would you come with me?
you know, like old times, instead of... agh, god, you know what, could this day get any worse?
hey, mikela lasker, how are you?
good to see you.
where is your saxaphone?
eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of when the saints go marching in that would blow your freaking mind.
well, you did not even hear it.
oh, good.
sure.
oh, yeah.
no, not at all.
nope, come on.
oh, you know what?
you know what?
i should not go in there.
I am pretty busy, i should just... oh.
wow!
oh, god.
oh, god.
all right.
wow.
um, i am never going to forget today.
not a chance.
i do not think i could ever give back to you what you have given me today.
who here has done something stupid in their lives?
like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between "a" gym and "b" gym, that sort of thing?
show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.
well, me too, I have done something stupid which i would like to share.
ummm.
should we go?
ah.
all right.
i came here today because i promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.
but you know what is invaluable is intuition.
you know what that is?
that is the ability to know when something is about to happen.
does anybody out there have intuition?
know what is going to happen next?
nobody?
okay, you are going to make me say it.
all right, i am so proud of all of you.
derrick, and lefevre, and ben, and ayana, and mikela, and nikki and jason, and... I am sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?
well zion, i am not going to be paying for your college tuition.
which brings me to my main point and that is that i will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.
I am so, so sorry.
I am sorry.
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
i lied to myself too.
I am not a millionaire.
i thought i would be by the time i was 30, but i was not even close.
and then i thought maybe by the time i was 40, but by 40, i had less money than when i was 30.  maybe by my 50s, i do not know.
i wanted to pay for your education.
i really did.
it was my dream.
some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.
my dream was in the right place.
okay, hold on.
hold on.
now i can not pay for your college.
but you do not have to go to class to be in class.
online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.
and the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.
which is rendered useless without batteries, and i have one for each of you.
hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
they are lithium.
erin, can you give us a second?
yeah.
yeah.
i know, i know, i know, I am sorry.
what can i do?
i can give you an extra laptop battery.
not everyone took one.
how about this?
if you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
yeah, well, i owe you that at least, right?
really?
wow.
that is over $200 a year.
for-okay, okay here is what I am going to do.
I am going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.
I am going to date them one year apart.
now, you are to use one check a year.
and please call me before you cash the check?
because I have got monies to move around.
that is a lot of zeroes.
please stop.
15 lives.
i destroyed 15 young lives today.
yes.
you are what, like, 12?
i think you are doing a great job.
what do you want from this job, provided the company does not go out of business?
really?
you know, when i hired kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
yeah.
i just sort've had a feeling about him.
i have a feeling about you too.
heeeeeere's santa!
hey little girl, what would you like for christmas?
ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, i see.
what the hell is going on?
phyllis, jim?
phyllis is santa?
phyllis?
take it back.
that is absurd.
no?
no!
jim!
come on!
it is insane!
a woman santa, where does it stop?
no!
jim, this may be the last christmas that we have here, does not it make you a tiny bit anxious, me not playing santa?
come on!
fine!
then do it anonymously.
ransom note style.
you can- i -you know what, i have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk.
you can use those.
if this were russia, yeah sure.
everyone would go to one santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she would ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." at which point the kgb would arrest you and send you to siberia.
it is a good thing russia does not exist anymore.
ho ho ho!
why pay more to sit next to old tranny claus over there, when you can sit on my lap.
phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I am the real thing.
sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
no it is not, not like penis-wise.
hello little boy, what is your name?
oh!
i am so sorry that phyllis hates you.
and hates your body.
but, santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
right now!
come on over here, big boy!
there we go.
oh my god.
what would you like for christmas little boy?
what did you think was going to happen?
all right, just say "some toys" please.
damn it kevin, come on.
okay get off, get off!
oh!
oh, god!
okay you know what you get?
you get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so santa does not have to go through this again.
ryan come here!
come on, come on.
ahhh... ho ho ho!
come on i need this.
come over here!
just sit down!
yup.
ryan and i are just having some fun!
whoop!
okay, what?
okay.
you know what jim, there are two santas in the room.
things get ruthless!
do you understand, you forced my hand?
oh, do we?
do "we?" is that what "we" want?
why do not "we" take a vote on it?
hey!
okay!
everybody!
the office is being pulled apart!
i realize that.
there are traditions at stake.
and there are- no no no wait!
no!
there are other choices, there is information that we - are you kidding me?
kevin?
after you almost killed me?
I will get some punch.
that looks delicious.
i do not ask for much for christmas, i really do not.
it is not like I am begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants.
"oh buy me something expensive or I am going to kill myself."  that is not - i do not care about that.
all i want to be is santa.
and, you want to take that away from me?
fine.
go ahead.
but when you need my help because i am ruining everything, do not look at me.
behold!
jesus christ.
and i bring to you glad christmas tidings.
i want to remind everyone the true meaning of christmas.
those of you who wish to join me, that is great.
I am excited by that.
and those of you who do not, i forgive you.
but i never forget.
oh the anti-christ!
oh but i can push drugs in here?
is that what you are saying?
well you have to pick one or the other.
your choice.
pick your poison.
get back to me.
in the meantime, i am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
uh oh, what is dwight going to get?
what is iiiit?
oh yes.
it is space garbage.
dwight's going to be able to build himself a friend!
deck the halls with crappy gifts... yeah, except for cheating on your wife.
adultery's a sin, look it up in the bible people.
what did you get?
oh, that is appropriate.
lot of fire where you are going.
better get used to it.
you are going to h-e-l-l double hockey sticks.
you are going to hell stanley.
i can not see from here people.
somebody shout it out, do not make me get up.
that is fantastic.
you can make another dress that goes past your feet.
no!
andy had erin.
what?
was i not supposed to say it?
what?
turn it back on.
david, guess who I am sitting here dressed as.
I will give you a hint.
his last name is christ.
he has the power of flight.
he can heal leopards.
I am jesus, david, and you know why?
because phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as santa.
what?
really?
what is going on?
what the hell?
how rude!
does she do that all the time?
hey!
get off!
get off the phone!
what does that mean?
well, can not alan protect you?
all of us?
oh my god.
earlier today this office needed a santa.
and then it needed a second santa.
and then it needed a jesus.
and now, it needs a michael.
and that is one suit phyllis cannot fit into.
hey.
how is everybody doing?
that was a different guy.
that was jesus.
jesus sort of ruined the party.
hurt petulant jesus.
you know what is even more offensive, is baling on this party because some...  jerk ruined the first part of it.
dwight come here.
here is my debit card, i want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
i do not want to say.
but, "it is fun to stay at the -" "it is fun to stay at the -" mmm, mm mm mm.
you know what, christmas is not about santa, or jesus.
it is about the workplace.
all of you feel like my family.
ryan, you are my son.
and pam, you are my wife.
and jim.
and angela and phyllis, you are my grandmas.
and stanley, you are our mailman.
and i can not help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "how could they do this to us?" it is not... nevermind.
nothing.
i did not say anything!
we are going out of business!
david told me on the phone.
david told me.
earlier today.
he said, we have been sold.
dwight!
jesus!
david's gone.
alan's gone.
we are all gone.
it is hard for me to imagine a scenario, where meredith palmer keeps her job and david wallace does not - no offense meredith.
I will call him.
I will call david.
yes, i will.
because i always know how to get through to him.
he told me where his kids go to school.
i call the school, i tell them I am a pediatrician.
they patch me through to his secretary.
i use my little girl voice.
badda bing, badda boom.
it is not sweetie, it is michael scott.
stephanie could you hop off please?
david!
david, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
david, they do not believe me.
when you told me everyone was canned.
well i think we are past that now.
we are not fired?
yeah!
it is a christmas miracle!
woo hoo!
oh!
you got it?
what is that?
huh.
well, maybe those will help.
hi santa.
I would like to make a wish.
i would like an xbox, and a tv that is compatible with an xbox.
and, I am sorry.
you called bob?
come on!
phyllis!
okay.
oh god.
get a room santas!
thank you santa.
happy holidays.
dunder mifflin is about to be sold.
but first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch.
and... I am... pretty nervous about it.
and... I am... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment.
is that dishonest?
well, think of it this way: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that i am applying to the office are the same ones that have made lady gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.
i see you have met computron, our virtual helper.
I am michael scott.
welcome.
welcome.
computron is just one of the many modern devices that i have incorporated into the office.
watch this.
computron?
what is the world's largest ocean?
pacific ocean.
pretty cool, huh?
that is fantastic.
it is good, but it is not good enough.
keep working.
and here is pam.
she is our international sales consultant.
hello, stanley.
ok. well, i thought I would show you around a little bit - - since you made the trip out.
and i got us reservations at cooper's seafood.
you like lobster?
you have had lobster before, right?
they make the best maine lobster in the world.
you will love it.
no, computron, actually i think cooper's is the best.
you are going to love it.
oh, my god.
alright.
excuse me.
if you will - - follow me this way.
I will introduce you to the crack hr rep that you requested.
i give you toby flenderson.
have fun, you two.
i left a copy of best american mystery stories 1999 in toby's favorite stall.
so, yes, i think i bought us some time.
hey, tobes.
What are you doing?
What are you guys talkin' about?
stuff.
i love stuff.
hr stuff?
hr pufnstuf.
right up my alley.
what is that?
what kind of stuff is that?
ah.
talkin' bout, uh, what?
waste?
what does that even mean?
like garbage?
oh, time and resources.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
respectfully, toby, no.
no.
this company does not waste time or resources, ever.
this is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive.
right?
would you agree with that?
that is, that is true.
i feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth.
he has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that?
what is jim capable of... or pam... or kevin?
i do not care if he goes and files a report and says that we are nothing special because i think our future is very bright.
we have only just begun.
computron, I am going to pull your plug.
ok?
buddy?
just - sh - shut - shut up.
shut up.
sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon.
called my man, dwight, just to see what was shakin'.
so check out how we live they call it scranton!
the electric city.
scranton!
the electric city.
lazy scranton, the electric city.
they call it that because of the electricity.
the city's laid out from east to west and our public parks are libraries are truly the best.
call poison control if you are bitten by a spider.
plenty of space in the parking lot.
snack attack time.
we like cugino's they call it scranton!
the electric city.
scranton!
the electric city.
scranton!
the electric city.
scranton!
the electric city.
scranton!
ugh.
oh, yeah.
i got a big box, yes i do.
i got a big box how 'bout you?
it is from "sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to sabre, us.
i wonder what is inside.
scissor me.
dunder mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named sabre.
they stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses.
although david wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses.
we did not need them touching our asses.
oh!
wow.
awesome.
for accounting, a brand new printer.
and for the sales staff, a new fax machine.
this cord has creed written all over it.
and whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office.
thank you.
cool.
what next?
okay, everybody, listen up.
i have some bad news.
due to circumstances beyond my control - hey, hey.
i have opened a box, which should not have been opened... and distributed things which should not have been distributed.
and -  wow.
really nice job.
this group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great.
and i think that you should all be proud of yourselves.
alright, relax.
we can do it.
we just did it.
so we can do this again.
erin, scissor me please.
thank you.
oh!
got it.
ok. alright, he is on his way up.
okay.
are we ready?
why do i have to explain everything?
okay.
gabe seems tall.
hope we get along.
had a very good thing going with david wallace.
he was a good guy.
he was somebody i could trust.
here he is.
you can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me.
even though i was there for disciplinary reasons.
you know what, dwight?
let us give him a minute to settle in, shall we?
ok?
hello, gabe.
i am michael scott, co-manager.
this is my protege, jim halpert.
in training.
we are very excited too, are not we guys?
right?
we have a little song prepared for you.
sabre.
say-ber.
sabre.
yes, say-ber.
good.
take it away guys.
saber.
wow.
really terrific.
perfect.
no.
do not like that.
mm, nope.
do not like that.
we will still get to use the little cups, though, right?
i do not know what they are made of.
you know what can not fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips i take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans i do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly.
and the 20 little conversations that i have with stanley.
there is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company.
but 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if i can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba - really?
you do not have enough water in there?
your stomach?
what?
i miss the old dunder mifflin.
too much change is not a good thing.
ask the climate.
i do not want to appear ungrateful for everything sabre's doing for us.
well, you should have a little.
but it is great that you do not, because i am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I am - I will be honest, I am having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of  them.
all of them.
so maybe we should call.
we should call someone.
i could help.
I am good with bosses.
call one of the higher-ups?
hello.
no.
my name's michael scott.
hello.
nice to meet you.
we are very excited about the merger with sabre.
i think you have a great accent.
well, i am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank.
i think we have done things a certain way here at dunder mifflin for quite some time, and - ok. i feel very strongly that you can not just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever.
is christian slater back there?
because... he knows.
he would know what to do.
i have already told him, but i will tell him again if you think that will help.
i have come here today to talk to mr. david wallace about this whole thing going on with sabre.
he will know exactly what to do.
he is not a big fan of me dropping by announced.
but then again, who is?
hey.
hi, sorry.
i hope you are not busy doing something.
you sure?
you look great too.
oh, yeah, that sounds good.
hey.
wow.
really loud.
wow.
oh, yummy.
you have got the life, my friend.
can i just stay here and never go back?
oh, man.
how much time do you have?
yeah.
hi.
sorry, i was just in the neighborhood, thought I would come by, see... i do not know.
sabre is changing everything.
site blockers.
they do not let us use cups.
so i started thinking, who could handle this?
who would know what to do?
david wallace would know what to do.
what should i do, david wallace?
exactly.
what are you thinking?
it is a tough one.
yeah.
but one would be good.
okay.
okay.
so the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
oh, okay.
no, i think it is- yep.
the what?
oh, okay.
like it.
there are very few things that would make me not want to team up with david wallace.
and suck it is one of  them.
see you later.
bye now.
thanks for having me.
well, that is not the david wallace that i remember.
that is some sort of weird creature that lives in david wallace's house.
oh, my god.
alright.
just get me out of here.
hello.
is anybody home?
oh, thank you, erin.
now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so i can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast.
here we go.
you know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them?
i feel sorry for those people.
that is the best thing?
really?
ugh.
well, I am not really one for making speeches.
but i feel pretty good right now.
i really do.
a lot better than i did earlier.
let me tell you.
no.
this is my toast.
i think this whole thing with sabre is going to work out.
i have a very good feeling about it.
here is my toast.
orange juice is in here.
and, like saber, it is from florida, and it is good.
here is the toast.
I am going to do it now.
raise your container to us and to sabre.
mm.
wow.
that is metallicy.
ugh.
that is like drinking a battery.
ah, really gets you in the fillings, does not it?
okay, anyway, welcome.
hello vancouver, this is michael scott calling from the united states of america!
i have a reservation in your fair city from february 12th to the 19th, first week of the olympics.
okey doke.
what?
no.
no.
we are trying to look it up right now.
um, come on.
well, i have been booked for three years, so you should have that.
I have always heard that british columbia is a very nice place, but i am not getting that from this conversation.
oh.
that is it!
alright, i would like to cancel my reservation, please.
okay, put it on my card.
today, jo bennett, the ceo from sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time.
she bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she is got to be kind of nervous.
i mean, are we ugly?
are we smart?
are we cool?
are we too cool?
do we speak english?
why hello!
pleasure to meet you, miss bennett.
jo, i do not know how things work in florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
whoa, whoa!
and sometimes i can hardly handle that!
forget the question... i humbly accept the management position.
because, well, jim.
where I am from, two types of folk: those who are not, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper.
which type are not you are not?
ya'll come back now.
yes.
no, we know.
texas!
i could manage my way around that.
i will try to manage my excitement!
i have been saying the word "manager" a lot, so whenever jo thinks "manager" she thinks of me.
camel cigarettes did the same thing with joe camel by making him look like a penis.
i can not even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis.
and vise-versa.
sure.
you here to tell me that you think i would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
what?
what?
really?
wow!
la la la, hello oscar!
what are you reading?
oh, that is my favorite ocean!
i love it!
i am so happy right now.
no!
i can not keep it a secret any longer.
jim is stepping down to salesman, i am going to be the sole manager once again.
why, is there an untapped gay market?
...where did you get that information.
manuel who?
well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions.
i have been hustled.
son of a bitch.
pardon me.
okay.
really?
aw, that is so sweet of you!
but, i cannot accept, because i have been thinking about it, and i think i want to go back to sales.
yeah.
you can take the man out of the salesman, but you can not take the sales out of salesman.
no, i think i would be bad.
i would sleep in my office, and i would sexually harass people.
I am turning myself in right now!
thank you.
great!
that is great.
congratulations.
have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
how is that possible?
no excuses erin, come on!
make it happen.
oh, yeah.
fine, fine.
leave it here.
i have to make some sales anyway.
who should i call with my magic sales fingers?
michael scott, head of sales.
it will be a pleasure doing business with you.
thanks, bye.
i just got a new account for the gentleman's club in carbondale.
it is called "curves." i went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in.
not really my cup of tea.
actually, kevin, you might like it!
why not?
it is part of the sales experience.
well, okay... what is that smell?
do you smell that?
what is that?
like a sulfur deposit under here?
no, I am serious, we do not have to put up... is it the dogs?
you know what, we do not have to deal with this.
i am going to google sulfur maps.
no, this is geological.
are you kidding me?
and you guys are okay with this?
oh my god.
hey.
you know, it is funny.
i used to stand in here and wish i was out there.
now I am out there, and i wish i was in here.
yeah.
except there is no grass out there.
it is just a farty dirt patch.
i really need my job back.
we made a terrible mistake here.
we make a poster that says "happy opposite day!" and she sees it on the way out... nah, that is stupid.
ugh!
i wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from men in black.
lethal weapon?
what?
what I am saying... and weirdly I am a good dog person, right guys?
see?
they love me.
alright!
oh, it smells good in here.
erin, what about my keyboard?
aw, so good to be home.
how about a little bosa nova?
oh, oh, oh!
contraption!
she is contrapting!
okay, you know what?
i think i should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.
i am a licensed, classy driver in the state of pennsylvania.
i gassed up the car... actually, i put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
happy to do it.
also, i did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
oh, yuck!
tmi!
how was it?
i do not want to know.
tell me later.
let us go!
let us go!
hospital!
shut up, nick.
what a weird thing to say.
weird i.t.
nerd.
do not get revenge on me, nerd.
no, no, no, no, no.
you know what?
you can not tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
distractions are good!
that means conference room, five minutes!
no, no, five seconds!
right now, right now!
conference room!
topic, potpourri!
let us go!
um, i am sort of a master of distraction.
when i was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how i was always able to distract others in class.
try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
the purpose for this meeting is to take pam's mind off of what is going on inside of her body.
i will allow that.
okay.
does anybody have anything?
anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
yes, phyl?
nope, nope, i do not think anybody wants to see that.
that sounds good!
do you need some music, or...?
okay.
where are we?
we have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
yeah, happy times.
come on.
let us have happy times.
jim, as a matter of fact, i have printed out ten ways to induce labor.
and I am thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.
erin, read the first one.
okay, nobody touch pam's nipples.
think of pam's nipples as toby's grundle.
okay, yeah, why do not you go get it?
okay, the opposite of that?
ooh, someone is freakin'.
i think he is.
pam, pam!
okay, alright, okay, it is time.
time to go to the hospital.
somebody get jim, please!
is it midnight yet?
4:35.  alright, almost made it.
almost made it.
too bad you did not have sex like seven and a half hours later.
but you had to have the afternoon delight.
i understand.
sometimes you have to go for it.
let us go to the hospital, shall we?
we can do... oh.
what?
you want to eat cat food with kevin and not go to the hospital?
what is october feast?
okay, okay, jim.
i think this feast is over and it is time to go to the hospital.
that is right, let us do this.
let us go, pam.
yeah, i think we should head out.
are you kidding?
you can do this.
you can do this.
I am scared, too.
yeah.
we are going to have a baby.
let us do that.
two minutes apart.
it is okay.
i know, i know, i know.
it went by too soon.
we are okay, jim!
okay, pamela.
you know what time it is?
you are not going to.
you know where you are going?
yes, you are.
and you know what you are going to have?
yes!
we are going to the hospital and we are going to have a baby.
i got it!
i got it!
everybody it is go time!
at your stations.
stanley, man the phones.
meredith, please, get bottled water.
erin, call an ambulance, please!
no, jim, you are in no condition to drive.
i will drive you.
check!
got it.
yes.
go bag!
where is my go bag?
where is my go bag?
you are telling me now that there is nothing in it.
okay, great!
oh, hey, hey, um, should i bring a dictionary to the hospital?
no, no, no.
dwight, let jim do that, please.
thank you!
wish me luck!
here we go!
here we go!
on our way!
come on, stanley!
okay.
we are going now!
no, no, no, no!
out, out!
idiot.
dwight, what is the traffic like?
alright.
geesh, dwight!
what!?
where?
by the bushes?
okay, go, go, go, go!
okay, just breathe...  she?
you found out?
come on, guys.
i wanted to be surprised.
yeah?
I am texting about you, okay!?
guys, guys!
stop fighting, come on.
come on.
do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?
right?
okay, you know what?
i am all over this.
here we go.
ready?
hello, dwight.
pam left her ipod at her house.
i want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.
we need it yesterday.
okay.
okay.
do you have everything, guys?
okay, alright.
dunder-mifflin.
it is okay.
i just did.
where is my little nibblet?
halpert, room d1.
alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.
here we go.
okay, not yet, not yet.
I am going to go wash my eyes.
that kid's going to have a lot of hair.
i think it is going to be any minute now.
phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
oh, my god.
go, go, go!
are you insane?
alright.
guys?
hello?
um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an eta when this is going to... you are starting, you are kind of losing them.
yeah, that is right.
it is a baby, see?
okay.
you can not smoke anywhere these days.
guys, guys!
eleven pounds... thank you!
thank you!
where is the baby?
i want to see the baby.
oh!
oh, helene, hi.
oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?
congratulations on being a grandma.
hello.
oh, good for you.
i worry about you.
love you, as a friend.
ooh, i want to hold the baby!
alright.
oh, okay.
mm-hmm.
oh.
ooh, wow.
michael.
michael.
there she sat.
her name was pam.
she was a receptionist.
she was engaged to an animal.
there sat jim.
he was a gawky, tall salesman.
the odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.
i made a family!
i got these two together, and i made a family.
who else here is single?
i am offering up my services to you all.
you saw what i did with pam and jim.
i can help you, too.
okay, show of hands.
who wants to live in a world where stanley has two lovers and you do not have any?
who else?
come on!
people, i know models!
ha ha, you got that right!
meredith?
come on, you are obviously single.
andrew, what about you?
well, when you least expect it, expect it.
i am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.
i am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.
and, like cupid, i am going to shoot you with love.
what would you say, if i told you that i was about to change your life?
i would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
okay, hold on.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
you got to let the cookies cool before you pop  them in your mouth.
why do not you guys get to know each other?
maybe have lunch together?
good!
sure.
kevin, please leave.
bye.
okay.
this is going to kill kevin.
I am not so sure.
kevin has an enormous heart.
literally, he has an elephant heart.
he had a transplant when he was seventeen.
had some problems, blah blah blah.
no, kevin does not have an elephant heart.
but he is very sensitive.
and it will not kill erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like i promised him...  i bet his heart is enlarged, though.
just do not let him sit on you...  I am kidding.
you will have fun.
it will be good.
it will be good.
there he is.
go to him.
kevin.
erin would like a few words with you.
oh, my god, this is agonizing.
look, kevin, do you really think that you could have dated erin?
okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, kevin.
and I am surprised that you did not question me in the first place.
no.
lynn was as hot as erin.
this is not about me, and that is debatable.
and i have a personality, where as you...  yes, andy?
kev...  nice.
going.
there is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.
and that is what i thought that erin and kevin were going to find today...  i think I am going to be sick... hello hello.
top of the morning to you!
ooh ooh!
green m&amp;ms!
nature's viagra!
two of my favorite joke areas combined.
it will be a good day.
it is st. patrick's day, and here in scranton that is a huge deal.
it is the closest that the irish will ever get to christmas.
morning, honey-pile.
it is.
this is a little something for you to remember your time here in scranton by.
yes it is!
no, no no- that is a good gift actually.
buildings here in scranton are literally powered by coal.
mm, that sounds great, actually.
when you work for sabre, only one thing matters.
and i do not care if you are a loser, or you practice bestiality, if jo likes you, you are in.
and i am in!
that is a great idea jb.
oscar, homosexual accountant.
daryl.
mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse... okay.
look at that picture that you drew.
nice job!
we are very proud of you.
you know what, we are going to tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
oh no!
say it is not so, jo, we are going to miss you, we are going to miss you so much!
well, i am heading down there.
how about july 4th weekend?
i did!
you know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, i have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so i think we should pull the trigger and - all right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
let us follow the chain of events.
jo likes michael.
jo invites michael to house.
jo does not like michael anymore.
hmmm.
hello.
i want you to stop what you are doing right now.
you are stressed, and I am taking you to lunch.
no is not an option.
all right.
well if you need me, I will be on the other side of that wall.
knock once for yes, twice for no.
I will be over there.
very nice.
a real hoop dreams story you got there.
oh man, you seem to have caught jo's eye.
how did you make that happen?
hm mm.
seriously, how did you do it?
how do i put this delicately?
does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
okay.
all right.
hey there.
so i think I am done.
going to head out.
unless you want to chat.
like we were doing earlier.
mm?
well, the clock says chatting time, so.
right.
what?
mm.
mm.
oh well.
no, no, no.
that is super-clear-ish.
nope.
nope.
nope.
nope.
hey pack-man.
how you doing stud?
you already there?
how is the lady situation?
ah damn.
that sounds great.
unfortunately i am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
yeah.
maybe next year.
how late do we have to work tonight?
why does she do that?
why does not she just tell you what your schedule is?
do i really want to turn out like gabe?
twenty-six.
single.
tied to my desk.
no life, no family.
i want to have been married by the time i would have turned thirty.
that is just - that is just depressing.
hello jo.
there is, as a matter of fact.
it is getting sorta late.
it is 8:30. and it is st. patrick's day, which is a world ethnic holiday.
so i have decided I am going to dismiss my employees.
I am thrilled with the work they have done today, both quality and the quantity.
great performance, very, very solid all the way around.
okay.
happy st. patrick's day.
and also, i would like to say that i will be canceling my trip down to tallahassee.
although i do look forward to our professional relationship.
yes.
excuse me, excuse me.
hey guys!
drinks are on me!
oh -hoh!
all right.
did i mess up my career today?
my future prospects at sabre?
i do not know.
there is a chance.
yes.
i tell you i love my job.
but jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?
nah.
i spent all day, trying to make her like me, and i forgot to ask myself something: do i even like her?
as the irish poet bobby mcferrin says, "do not worry, be happy." okay.
okay, all right.
best night ever.
what the hell is going on back there?
hey jim, jim.
come here.
do you know who that is?
look at him.
look at him - t-shirt, jeans... i am flattered.
that is johnny depp.
in my condo complex.
i am flipping out, man.
i mean, you remember my idea for the fourth pirates movie.
hey, jim, jim - where, where do i find the black pearl?
captain jack sparrow.
captain jack sparrow, jim.
no.
I am captain jack sparrow.
okay, okay.
screw you, halpert.
you know, it is not easy getting excited about stuff.
remember how you felt when you thought you would seen roger clemens?
yeah.
well, it was not him.
i know, i know.
i know!
it also explains why the name on his mailbox was m shulman.
first up, the lost and found has gone missing.
it itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it.
ah, pet day.
if you do not have a pet, please do not feel like - ah, yes, the leads.
the leads that sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet.
but will be..  no, no, meeting's not over.
no sales topic per se.
dwight?
i would like your undivided attention, please.
over the last few weeks, things have been changing here.
sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads.
i think it is kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
yeah.
m-hmm.
is that all you have to say to me?
wow, wowie wowie.
congratulations.
it is a big cheque.
stop sexting pam.
I am trying to congratulate you.
you writing your memoirs over there?
well, it is a pretty big check.
okay.
do not gloat.
here is the thing.
this kind of money can corrupt people.
I am just saying, that - honey and jelly sandwich time.
oh, you got to be kidding me.
look at that.
that is - you saw who did this and you did not stop them?
the sales department smashed my sandwich.
you do not get it.
that is what she said.
yeah.
thank you very much.
ah, just the stupid leads.
alright.
then i guess i should give them out.
hold on.
you know what I am thinking?
I am thinking that i have something that you want.
you guys are acting like you own this place.
and you do not.
not even sabre owns this place.
it is a rental.
I am kind of sick of the attitude around here.
I am sick of the cocky walk, i am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, i am sick of your uppity attitude, jim... i think i am not going to give these to you.
then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour.
okay.
just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone.
if that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
they act like i have no power.
hmm.
well, if that is what i am required to do, i will do exactly that.
exactly that.
exactly that.
hello.
may i have everyone is attention, please?
gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I am going to give the leads to... king creed!
- and to king meredith!
and to king angela!
because today we are all kings.
and queens .
I am giving them the leads, phyllis.
hey.
mm-hmm.
okay.
alright.
oh, right, those are clues.
and within each clue is a lesson.
you learn a lesson, and then you find a lead.
the leads are scattered all over the industrial park.
i am trying to make your kids respect you.
because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids do not respect the father who does not respect the boss.
do you understand that line of logic?
i do understand it.
or is it?
today i turned an office crisis into a teachable moment.
a lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally  some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing  some people should not be in this business.
well, bigshot, 'if you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
wait.
what day is today?
oh my god.
oh my god  oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey  wait, wait!
okay.
you know what, let us just go to the dump, start looking - ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car - why?
because i am not going to call sabre and say, 'hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today?
well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they are now in the city dump." well, that is not the way it is going t sound.
here is what we are going to do.
we will go to the dump, we will look around, then we will all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night.
what do you - really?
okay, no, you encouraged it.
you were complicit  complicit.
you were all successories!
you can.
okay fine, i get it.
I will just go by myself.
you know, dwight, there was a time when you would be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
yeah.
sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn.
if you do not believe me, look in my gutters.
you have changed, man.
since when do you care about money?
when i first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
no, I am talking about your personality, dwight.
assistant to the managed him - yeah.
you think you would have done better without me?
really?
wow.
ohhhkay.
man.
when i think about all the time i wasted being your friend - i should not have been hanging out watching karate movies with you - you know what, i should have been doing?
i should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies - that is my wife you are talking about, man.
if i wanted to hit you, i would have hit you.
no no.
you just made an enemy with the wrong guy, dwight.
no, time out, time out.
time in!
do not even think about that okay, dwight.
here we go  oh god.
we are never going to find those leads, are we?
this  why would somebody throw that out?
yeah, she does - she loves purple.
does it stink?
know what would be a great picture here?
just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower.
that is it.
and the caption would read: in the dump.
no!
better!
I am going to give erin $15.
a one-on-one lunch with erin?
she is kind of a rube.
okay.
all right.
all right.
okay.
I will take her to lunch.
hi, erin.
happy secretary's day.
i wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because i was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
ugh.
well, hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order.
so I am... okay, well, we will figure something.
okay, let us go to hayworth's.
all right.
would you mind if i listen to my book on tape?
I am kind of a bookworm.
this is the novelization of the movie precious based on the book push by sapphire.
i do not know.
ahhh.
right.
an age or month?
I have been trying.
I have been trying to keep it going.
erin is just weird.
so how are things going with andy?
well, let us see.
um... andy.
plays the banjo.
other than the fact that he dated angela, i do not think he is a snappy dresser.
i do not think he is the best dresser.
reminds me of easter.
mm-hmm.
you did not know that?
oh.
okay.
i do not know.
probably did not want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.
they were engaged, so...  okay, you know what, sir?
yeah, i asked for pickles with my burger.
and there are only, like five or six.
could i get some more pickles?
thank you.
mm-hmm.
yeah.
well... what are you doing?
what are you doing?
okay, okay.
you know what?
you know what?
you know what?
everybody's looking at you right now.
I will have what she is having!
did you have a... did you like your lunch?
did you have a good lunch?
did you like that?
did you enjoy your food?
it was good.
i liked my lunch.
you know what, i think we can all agree that angela's not so great, so.. no.
no.
no.
stop talking.
oh god.
andy, she is not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with.
all right?
and besides, who does not tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them?
that is like.. that is like mr. and mrs. smith crap.
you know what, i resent the implication that i would keep that secret.
everyone here knows that i can not and will not keep a secret.
erin?
no, no, i was just watching cookie monster.
it finally downloaded.
mind if i sit down?
oh.
yep.
I am sorry about that.
i feel... I am sorry i caused that thing.
well, yeah, yes.
but i still feel sorry.
you know what, i would not worry about angela.
she does not hold a candle to you, erin.
she is old enough to be your mom for one thing.
and she is, like, three feet tall.
and she wears pioneer women clothing.
and i do not think she is ever pooped in her life.
and andy, you know, come on.
andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
you said butt.
ahh!
you said it!
you know who you would love?
oh, this guy in my neighborhood, tom dizemore.
this is him: "hey!
hey scott!" oh, oh, i was just watching that.
did you do that, man?
"oscar.
i am the count." nailed him.
nailed him.
good work cookie monster.
buenos dias, erin.
no, no, no, no.
solamente en espanol, por favor.
i believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak spanish.
they are our neighbors to the south, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of north america.
and... i am going on vacation next week to cancun.
buenos dias, jaime.
ha ha!
buenos dias, dwight!
la telefona.
oh.
eso es lo que dice, el!
damn it.
ah, angelo.
yo soy cancun.
can you smell the power of the halperts?
power couple.
i went with the people i thought would put the best face on the company.
did somebody order a hooker over here?
hi.
how are you?
there is this woman i met a few weeks ago.
her name is donna, the manager of sid &amp; dexter's and, right now, we are in the midst of a passionate love affair.
um, no.
but she is coming by today.
maybe to buy some printers, so... right here, we have the wonder twins, jim and pam halpert.
they will be assisting you today.
hi.
sorry to interrupt.
sorry to interrupt.
do you, donna, by any chance shop at victoria's secret?
because i keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through may.
okay, i have more of them.
i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and i want to show you... there we go!
whoa, look at those vivid colors.
look at my eyes.
those are shrek-green eyes.
that is me again.
i think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
and that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black.
it is subtle.
that is how it works.
i show her an image that turns her on.
and then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image.
soon, she does not know what is me, what is the image.
she just knows that she is turned on.
this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts.
I have never taken anybody there before.
ryan.
and that is it.
that is me.
that is who i am.
oh, thanks.
you are not bad, either.
hmm.
jim!
could you come in here for a sec?
what was that printer we were looking at?
you did not see it, pam.
she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move.
shortbread?
oh really, jim?
what about pam?
and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss.
maybe this could be my pam.
look, i know that i screwed up in there.
i know that i probably messed up your sale.
i just want to go in and fix it.
so maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
maybe wee find some wiggle room?
i think we could.
okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right?
like for tax purposes.
why do not you run them again?
if she is, it is working.
so corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller... operating blahdy blahdy blah.
boilerplate.
pound of fish.
just kidding.
do you like mints?
i carry mints with me sometimes.
you ever tried those?
they are good sure.
i can not stop myself from kissing her.
okay, guys, guys, guys.
just tell me it is not totally insane to try one more time.
okay.
what do you think?
andy?
okay, some for, some against.
pam?
I am going with pam's group.
here we go.
okay.
no, guys, guys, guys.
guys, just... thank you for talking.
wish me luck.
what sort of movie would rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections?
would have been a lot shorter.
probably been a lot funnier.
but it would have ultimately been a disappointment.
i still would have seen it, but that is not... the point.
we should have your contract done by thursday.
okay.
yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
i do not know.
i think so.
okay.
so... oh, donna?
thank you so much.
mmm.
ahem.
so, um... okay, if you have... if there is any other questions that you have... all right.
all right.
bye.
and have a good elevator ride.
oh, what is that out there?
i do not know.
i do not know.
can not really trust my feelings anymore.
she suckered you too.
was it the cleavage?
yep.
god.
she left this here?
okay.
maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
yeah.
this could be a signal.
people do not just take barrettes off.
well... yeah, i know.
i know.
i know.
you are right.
thank you.
thanks everybody.
oh.
you are still here.
i have your baguette.
you know what?
everybody told me that you were not interested.
everybody.
and i did not believe  them.
and they were right.
so... there is your barrette.
who?
about what?
no, no.
no.
no... what happened?
really?!
oh, that is great.
that is such good news.
i did it!
i kissed.
we kissed.
no, I am serious.
it... this happened.
i went down to the parking lot and i was... i returned her barrette  we ki... we did.
okay.
we did.
we did.
you know what?
it does not matter.
because i know it happened.
and that is all that counts.
i did do it!
jim.
are you clicking a detonator?
get back to work, dwight.
please.
ooh!
things with donna are so... oh-ho-ho!
they are going great.
i, uh... we are just clicking on every level.
emotionally and sexually and... orally and i am not used to relationships going this well.
I am actually having trouble focusing on my job.
and i like it!
who enjoys the weekends?
of course.
now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which i do.
i have donna.
she is hot.
she has a pilates butt.
but we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex.
did i say that?
yes, i did.
and the reason you are here is that i need ideas for things that donna and i could do on the weekend.
so just shout it out.
okay.
okay, you get out of here, big dog.
ah, no, no, no, no.
you guys sit down.
i need ideas.
yeah, well, stanley does not help with anything.
come on.
shout  them out, shout  them out.
oh!
that is fun.
all right.
we actually went to the poconos last tuesday.
we headed up there, we went to a little chinese bistro, um, p.f.
chang's.
because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "i want to go to mount pocono," you go to mount pocono and you do her.
and we screwed.
whoops.
tmi.
you know what, kelly?
this is the real world.
not the real world: scranton.
oh my god, this is super weird.
when ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in hazelton just so the other girl would not see.
you guys think donna's cheating on me?
... and... we had sex, too.
how?
how do i not make any more of it?
all right.
and she will not say, "i love you." nine dates.
i said it on the second date.
yeah, she does all that.
no, no... run what?
why did not you just say that, pam?
well, that is easy for you to say.
you have a bad imagination.
it is stupid.
i live in a fantasy world.
yes, jim, i do.
and i can not stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
that is what makes it so wrong.
ever since i found out that donna might be cheating on me, i have not eaten or slept.
this not knowing, that is what is killing me.
i want someone to follow donna.
i want her tailed.
i need the name of a good private investigator.
this is you.
how much do you charge?
I will give you $50.
money's no object.
okay.
it is never too early for ice cream, jim.
but we did not have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
it is comfort food, all right?
god.
i know.
well, i hope you are right.
we will see what dwight says.
because i have him investigating her.
I am waiting for a text update.
it is too late to undo it.
i need to know.
otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
god, this is so disgusting.
i know.
that is not true.
you are right, i ruin everything.
and I have known some wonderful women.
holly, carol, january helene?
oh.
oh, yeah.
yes, yes.
yes.
all of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
all right.
you are back.
what happened?
no, what happened with donna?
ugh!
no.
no!
are you sure?
who eats eight protein bars?
okay.
well, i am just glad this is all over.
what?
no, she did not say that.
i am not paying for that membership.
ohhh... mmm... no, i like the attention.
is she here yet?
that is her?
mm-hmm.
right.
right.
right.
okay, I will talk to you later.
i did not.
everybody else here did.
everybody convinced me that something was up.
they poisoned my mind.
ye... pfff.
well, no.
it is a lie.
that is not what happened.
i just like you.
i can not believe i get to be with you.
you work at an adult arcade.
you could have any man you want.
if you want to dump me, i totally get it.
well, you are boner-ific.
...poop my pants.
oh, my god, vero beach.
no.
is that on the water?
we are?
wow.
that is exciting.
hey.
well it can wait.
it can wait.
jim is her husband.
and they are having problems, so sh... good in bed.
oh, my god.
look at how cheap street level rooms are.
am i the only person who enjoys people watching?
okay, weirdo.
yeah, i just remembered that i have to go to the bathroom.
pam?
who the hell is this?
who is this guy?
god!
lowest of the low.
that guy.
just a notch above toby.
you know what?
I am going to kill him.
no, I am not.
i feel... i... no, I am not going to kill him.
i have to hear it from her.
i need to have her tell me herself.
right?
i need to have her say... i need to say, "what the hell is that?
what the hell is that?" no, god!
no, no, oh, my god!
okay.
okay.
okay.
you know what?
we should really do something fun this week.
would not that be fun?
how about thursday?
i can not do thursday.
book club.
how about friday?
oh, really?
because i was thinking we could go to this concert.
spice girls are opening for weird al.
front row.
it would be a great, great concert.
oh okay.
well, maybe i could stop by.
nope, that is tuesday.
you are cheating.
you are cheating on me.
pam told me.
who is he?
the other man.
who is the guy?
who is it?
I am the mistress?
toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.
the first time i threw mine away, i thought it was an ant trap.
but i figured I would rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc.
the second time... i thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos.
like a cow thing.
but upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so i threw it away.
and the third time... i did it out of spite.
pfffffttt.
you are kidding me?
god!
you say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth?
what is this?
you know what?
we are not going to die of radon, we are going to die of boredom.
right?
and if i had a gun with two bullets and i was in a room with hitler, bin laden, and toby, i would shoot toby twice.
okay, alright.
i would kill bin laden and then toby.
okay geniuses, how would you do it?
i do not know.
yes, we stab toby through the heart with an icicle.
toby, just do it!
god!
good work.
morning everyone.
hello!
oh, thank you.
it is reversible, i think.
oh!
oh wow, are those eagles' flavors?
cake it to the limit.
that is my favorite!
i love that!
too much for me to have by myself.
anybody want to share?
okay.
well... that is random.
i will dig into those later.
no, i got to go.
text me later.
hey.
oh, hooters to go.
nice.
that... exists?
okay, well, I will have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
okay, pam... she is not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
i like donna.
is it wrong to keep seeing her?
depends on who you ask.
i mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it is wrong.
well, i think we all know what you are capable of meredith.
people, this is scranton.
and many people consider that to be the paris of northeastern pennsylvania.
and in paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
i will have you know that i asked donna about this and she is fine with it.
and just to be sure, i asked her again afterward.
same answer.
he is never going to find out.
he is a high school baseball coach.
he wakes up early.
he goes to bed early.
look at how long it took for him to find out.
it was right under his nose.
i had to tell him.
I am sorry, it... why is it okay for stanley to cheat or for phyllis to cheat... on her diet!
he is a sports guy.
he is scummy.
dogfighting.
drugs.
they spit.
real sports with bryant gumble.
you know what?
you know what?
i am declaring a moment of silence right now.
ten minutes of silence honoring michael jackson.
just sit there and think about michael jackson.
mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone?
i am not in the wrong here.
i am the good guy.
do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy?
do you think he is an angel?
i do not think so.
why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me?
there has to be a problem with him.
i am beyonce always.
yes, i am.
i would love that.
i have work to do.
let us go.
i can not wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife.
i should punch him in the nose for what he is making me do to her.
all right, andy, please.
shh!
try not to draw attention, please.
that is him.
that is him.
right there.
the coach!
right there.
look, look.
follow my finger.
okay?
see?
the grownup by the base?
all right.
can you just- can you just act normal for a second, please?
you have no idea what you are talking about.
you do not.
no, no.
you do not know.
you do not- you do not know anything.
look at him.
look at him over there.
high-fiving?
he did not even do anything.
kid did all the work.
i bet he does that at home.
i bet it is like, "hey, donna, why do not you wash the dishes?" "high-five, donna." "hey, why do not you bring me my slippers?" "hi-five.
I am taking all the credit." okay, well, that is because he is paying their salary.
i know, i know, i know.
it-I am-it- that was a euphemism.
shh!
okay, all right.
do not, do not.
okay.
no.
god.
you go talk to him.
no, no, no.
I am good.
oh, my god.
sorry.
i got some stomach cramps.
well, that was not at all what i expected.
hoo hoo!
whoo.
my heart's still racing.
i just looked a man in the eyes and i shook his hand.
all the time i was thinking, "I am sleeping with your wife." and you know who does that?
james freakin' bond.
okay, orange slices.
there ya go.
do not thank me.
thank dylan's mom.
here you go!
oh!
ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo!
you love it.
there ya go.
uh, no, they did not say team.
they just said coal hawks.
well, then it would not be the first time i stole something away from coach shane.
i did.
no.
we just talked.
he is very nice.
it did not.
is not it?
I am awful, are not i?
I am an awful guy!
ooh!
i am what i am, oscar.
and i want what i want.
and right now, i want a piece of cake.
from now on, when I am hungry, i am going to eat whatever i am hungry for.
i do not care.
i have an appetite for life!
mmm.
mmm!
oh, god.
that is lemon.
you will learn, baby.
you will learn.
yeah, i noticed that.
nope.
i have got big balls.
okay.
phyllis.
okay.
look at me.
phyllis, look at-  okay, that is...  all right, all right.
you know what?
I am sick of this.
I am sick of the little disapproving head shakes.
if you think that is going to have any effect on me, it will not.
i am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet donna.
because a motel is dirty and it is sexy.
like me.
and like donna.
and frankly, the stuff that we are into is not very condo-appropriate.
okay, morgan freeman-narrating-everything.
nobody better try to stop me.
good.
how do i feel about breaking up with donna?
good.
moral.
i feel proud.
like a grownup.
that was not easy because i really liked her a lot.
and I am a little bit emotional right now because i know that i absolutely made the right decision.
at the end of the day, we have to do what is right.
and it was either living with myself or... being happy.
and i picked... the... former.
yes?
umm... i have done some very bad things, things of which i am not proud.
i would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players.
and i vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
oh.
okay.
i was talking about... what do- what?
what is going on?
there is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any sabre printers.
case closed.
michael scott, as seen on tv.
oh!
pack man, i thought you were a girl!
apparently, there are allegations that sabre printers can because a fire.
so they asked me to give a statement to the press.
I am like, what?
all right.
so i do it.
it is on tv last night.
and it is in the paper today.
and it is online.
and then i call froggy 98.7, the request line.
i talk to the host about it on the air.
it is like, come on, people, enough.
everybody, we are at defcon 5. i am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the wbre news site.
oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile.
now, we cannot let the pedophile win again!
i would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
yes.
yes.
come on!
get it up!
that is what... let us do it!
please.
really?
a baby otter?
okay, um, count me in as who cares.
it is not even that interesting a baby otter, it can not even stand up.
it is trying to stand up...  there it goes.
jo!
we were not expecting you!
jo, jo, i can assure you it was no one in this office.
absolutely.
anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
there is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because i know everything there is to know about these people.
i know when their birthdays are, i know what their favorite kind of cake is, i know what color streamers they like... yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
okay.
we should give him a one-way ticket to montego bay, where they keep all the al-qaeda.
yes.
you put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
i want these people to really pay, i want them to suffer.
I would prefer it if they died, because it is not right.
okay.
ridiculous, angela.
and like I am going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
is there something that you would like to say to me?
about talking to the press?
mmhmm.
i do not believe you.
that is a little much.
all right, all right, all right.
okay, i believe you, i believe you.
did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
oh, no, no, no... oh my god.
was she cute?
oh, god, darryl!
i basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then i find out that one of my best ones did.
and now he is probably going to get fired for it.
and if that is not poetic justice, i do not know what is.
you leaked it?
i do not know what the best plan is, pam.
oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
oh.
two whistleblowers... two!
i always thought darryl and pam might get me fired for something i said.
so see you in meredith's van in five minutes.
no, you know what is messed up?
this situation all up in here is what is messed up!
we need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this!
brain hurricane.
come on, think.
what do we got?
it is okay, she is cool, she also whistle-blew.
hey, hey, it is as interesting as a morgue.
okay, here is what we do.
i say we just smash all the computers.
we destroy the evidence.
no evidence, no case.
no.
okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
just do not say no.
that is just what we need, another black man in prison.
you know, let us just... okay.
you can count on me.
hey jo.
i was thinking about our little leak problem.
i was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual.
you know what i think we should do?
we make  them come to work, and we work  them, and we make  them sit next to all the people they screwed over.
and, and we pay  them but we make  them feel like they did something really wrong.
the one question i have is, do we give them a christmas bonus?
i say yes, it is christmas, but right after they are back in the thick of it.
what?
it does not matter what i know.
why?
well, deal with this.
what?
are you going to kill me?
are we going some place far away?
i know you said no questions, but... i have an early dinner that i need to get to... with the chief of police.
i have rights.
i am not going to tell you anything.
well, I am going through a little bit of a rough patch.
whole year, actually.
my favorite restaurant closed down.
and my new favorite restaurant sucks... i bought a video camera last year, and i was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that i felt was worth taping the whole year.
and most of that was just birds in my condo complex.
what is that?
... i miss holly.
holly flax from the nashua branch.
best hr rep that dunder mifflin has ever seen.
it is not been a blockbuster year for me financially.
my blockbuster stock is down.
hmm, hmm.
you know, i would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
i, i surely do, and do not call me honey.
you were playing too.
we at sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers.
we regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment.
at this time, we are issuing a full recall of all sabre gh400 printers.
we will not rest until this problem is solved.
there will be no questions.
are there any questions?
that was fun.
thanks.
today helped.
okay.
hey, you could transfer holly back from nashua.
i suppose summer had to end sometime.
it is sad, though, because i had a great summer.
i got west nile virus, lost a ton of weight.
then i went back to the lake.
i stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt.
that got infected even though i peed on it.
saw 'inception.' or at least i dreamt i did.
he is not the worst, okay?
he is not the worst.
you know who is the worst?
that intern we had a few years ago.
that guy-remember?
eeeh!
that face, how ugly he was?
he was the worst.
good worker, though.
ah!
it is not cappuccino.
it is just coffee, guys!
but, yeah, I will look into it, okay?
okay, rude.
luke, i want you to go to the supermarket for me.
to get some ice cream for everybody.
it is national ice cream afternoon.
great.
and another thing i did this summer, i hired my nephew.
having luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. the last time i saw luke was the opening day of 'ace ventura ii' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot.
anyway, i lost him in a forest.
do not bother luke.
that means do not.
have not you seen ghostbusters, pam?
no, it... yes, okay, right.
all right, yep.
my bad.
i got it.
here we go.
come on.
okay, um...  that is as clear as i can make it.
because i do not want it getting back to sabre that we are yelling at assistants.
i think it would reflect poorly on us.
nope, it will not be gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to luke.
well, dwight, he wiped his butt.
is that close enough for you?
no.
no, toby.
he is not.
yes he is.
he is my nephew.
luke is my nephew.
yes, exactly.
that is a very nice way of putting it, oscar.
mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
do you think they should have had open auditions for the band hanson?
what if no one named hanson showed up?
that would not even make sense.
or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer?
really safe.
god, when he needed help on earth, who did he hire?
jesus christ, his son.
thank you.
no!
no.
I am just saying, why does god get to do something that i do not?
well, then, why are not you bugging me to fire everybody who is bad?
you just want me to fire luke.
that is reverse nepotism.
he should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
because i wanted you to come to me and say, "wow, he is so great." and i was going to say, "well, it is in the genes." and i was actually going to be wearing jeans.
and I would point to them, right?
no.
but you ruined it.
so, thank you very much.
here he comes.
guys, look.
i do not want you to treat him like anyone else in the office.
i just want you to treat him like my nephew.
hey, there he is.
whoo!
whoo!
whoo!
ok, you know what?
just -just back off!
back off!
all right, those might be his.
he might own an ebay store.
ok, ok. you know what?
this is disgusting.
this is like a witch hunt.
this is like the blair witch hunt project.
I am reconsidering sending them back anyway.
wait a minute.
do not-all right.
well, ok, you have just committed a felony.
no, i know they fit.
it is not about the fit.
because gabe tattled.
i was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
you do not have all the facts.
i love him.
no.
no.
he is my nephew.
well, this office is my pool.
and my house is my house.
and i just want my nephew to work in my pool.
i will cover his ass like moss on a mississippi tree stump.
luke and i have been working side-by-side as master and commander.
me as master, he as commander.
occasionally he will need a little push, and i will do that, and he will slow down, and I will push him again.
that is the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing.
you have to push them until they push you back.
and then you push some more.
it is all about give and take, but mostly it is about pushing each other.
luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup.
you click on that first, then a whole new-not, no, no, no!
luke, come on.
come on.
not on oscar's head.
alright.
luke, come on.
stop it!
give me the pointer.
no, just power it down.
no, no, no, no, no.
not on angela's boob.
come on.
come on.
luke, seriously.
okay.
all right.
okay.
good job.
okay, email accounts.
so we are starting with account setup- okay, can i have that?
ok, i am going to count down from five.
I am not kidding.
give-okay.
alright, give it up.
you are going to learn to be more professional, luke!
that is what you are going to do, luke!
i had to do that.
all right.
are we good?
you are okay.
he is okay.
there are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
yes, of course.
what is this in reference to?
would have been nice to work with my family.
it would have been nice if luke had been able to stay here.
but he could not.
these things seldom work out.
i do not know how ringling brothers do it.
night after night, town after town, all across america.
you would think they would be sick of each other by now.
but, clearly, they make it work.
and my hat's off to them.
that is it?
really?
that is nothing.
all right.
that is highway robbery.
i can do that.
okay.
wait, what?
is there another option?
this is the worst!
you are the worst!
i hate looking at your face!
i want to smash it!
ok, you know what?
i made a mistake.
i committed corporate punishment.
my bad.
it is over.
it is done.
but my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.
i know what you want to ask me.
"did your mom ever see you naked?" so you can molest me?
oh, ok. i do not think so.
we are going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are.
that is the key.
one hour.
one hour.
we have done one hour.
let us just speed this up, ok?
keep it moving.
i want to do all six hours today.
no, no, no!
i know my rights!
all i had to do was sit here for six hours.
do my time.
you know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
yes, i will.
i will talk alright.
be careful what you wish for toby.
toby, can i really tell you anything?
well, the other night, i was sitting at the table, eating my penis... i mean peas.
that was weird.
aaaah... weird.
i think that was ... i was probed.
by an alien life form.
an a.l.f.
alf, you know, i might have actually been probed by alf.
you might think he is a puppet.
you never see the lower half.
but there is a lower half.
and i was raised by wolves.
i was 25 years old before i saw my first human being.
wait, is it a full moon tonight?
yes, yes.
they are all fake stories.
what sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that?
three hours.
we are half way done.
this is plenty complicated.
I have played it once or twice with jeff.
jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
yeah, yeah.
i guess i never thought about it that way, though.
yeah.
you know what?
he took me to a baseball game once, i remember.
it was weird though.
they took the pitcher out of the game.
i felt really bad, because the pitcher was not able to play with his friends anymore.
but jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out.
he really respected the manager.
i was afraid i would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
i guess that is why i thought he ran away in the first place.
to find a kid he liked better.
right.
why would a dog do that?
that is silly.
when i hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous.
but I have never said it out loud, so... well, let us not get too... this is not a counseling session... ok. son of a gun.
son of a bitch.
wow!
ok. you.
bitch.
god!
you are very helpful are not you?
you try to help everybody.
do you want to play another game?
you are good.
but you know what?
you can not help people.
you could not help your marriage.
you lose.
i do not need your help.
nobody needs your help.
nobody wants it!
you can not help anybody.
i do not need your help!
am i going to make you cry?
ok. you will do.
.
.
ok. filled out.
good.
thank you doctor.
take two of these  and call me in the morning.
you forged them!
you forged the forms!
yes.
yes, but you had me so worked up that i made a mistake.
you do not make a mistake on purpose, toby!
then it is no longer a mistake... gabe.
he messed it up.
he messed up the forms, i bet...  "i mess everything up so i can fix it and keep my job!
bah!
good thing I am here because i do nothing.
i make everybody nervous!"  ah, ok. got your notebook?
alright.
alright, let us bang this out.
let us do it to it!
that was amazing!
that was awesome!
i auditioned for this.
when did the cast list go up?
really?
they did not call me.
who am i playing?
...andy?
andy, what time's the show?
how long is it?
nope, can not make it.
they say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast andy's play, they took mine.
i can not andy, it is too hard.
that is-i put everything i had into that audition.
do you understand that?
wow.
i wish i could, andy, but i can not.
i have plans that night.
I am going to see a friend in a play called sweeney todd.
you are that friend.
I am going to see your play.
and scene.
oh, hey guys.
i did, because i am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
yes.
nope.
this is ridiculous.
you would think they would discourage people from bringing in balloons.
no, darryl.
this guy's a world-class actor.
he does not daylight as your plumber.
are you kidding me?
all right, I am sorry.
god.
hello.
okay.
okay.
yes.
good.
you enjoy the second act.
thank you.
you, too.
how is that funny?
boo!
boo!
mmm!
fruit is so much better when it is dried.
I have already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
yeah, good job.
well done.
hmm?
no, there were a lot of people booing you.
i was not one of them.
get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
well, he was getting a lot of applause, and i just did not think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
that would never happen.
okay.
i appreciate the feedback.
i do not like that at all.
hey, what is going on here?
post-show blues?
yeah, i get those every day after work.
oscar.
enough with the sass, please.
god!
what is wrong with you?
andy, listen to me.
look me in the eye.
i thought that you were awesome.
i am not just saying that.
you can trust that i am telling you the truth.
i booed someone tonight.
i have no filter.
and if i thought you were terrible, i would have booed.
and if i thought you had done a better job, i would be saying nicer things right now.
but i thought that you were exactly awesome.
no better, no worse.
i did not say that to make you feel good.
i just said it.
total integrity.
come on, andy, seriously.
in the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders.
these are their stories.
kun-kun!
I am just a cleaning lady.
aah!
a dead body.
he wrapped his belt around his own neck.
it looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation.
yeah, looks like everyone is tightening their belts in this economy.
last time you saw the victim, was he happy?
last time i saw this john, he was-he was not a victim, if you know what I am talkin about.
no, that was- I am just getting into the first act.
there are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work.
he is a fan of the outrageous.
he loves to surprise!
he loves... other things as well.
look,  it is a pimple phyllis.
avrile lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
you mean cancer?
it is?
just a cold sore, thank you.
phyllis, i do not have acne.
i have a cold sore.
i do not even have a cold.
i do not know how i got it.
how?
what?
yeah!
my last physical when i was forty.
no!
it was like four years ago!
why at least?
if you are guessing forty six just say forty six.
how did this happen, how did i get this?
you know what, i feel like one of those old timey sailors.
with the eye patch.
it is me own damn fault.
woman in every port.
do not even!
holly was clean!
okay?
if anything i gave it to her.
oh my god!
what if i did?
okay!
you know what?
might!
might be crawling with herpes.
i might have gotten it after her.
there is no way I am going to do that.
hi donna.
it is michael.
i have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
i can not even say it.
h-i... ...r-p-e-e-s no, i am calling to see if you gave me herpes.
because if you did i would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations.
so you have it right?
does your stupid husband have it?
yes i am telling you you have to get tested for herpes.
good-bye!
no this is holly.
no this is holly.
busted.
so what can i do for you holly.
oh really?
was anyone killed?
any nuns?
were they in the missionary position?
do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you had not been transferred?
we would have twins.
mmhmm!
mhhmm!
we would be married.
do what?
i do not romanticize th-  no... he had no arms or legs, he could not hear see, or speak... this is how he let a nation.
we were more than we were.
ok, alright i got to go.
it did not come up organically.
it is nice to see you doing so well.
bringing home the bacon.
would you excuse us... he has not changed.
am i the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
what?
well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like jordan and pippin!
because we work together.
am i the princess?
ok, so I am the guy at the station.
i have herpes.
i used to think that she was the one.
or at least a the one.
and if i called that one so wrong... you know, i do not know if i trust jan's judgment.
she... no, I am not talking about paper.
relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
yes, i do not... i know, i know.
got it.
I am trying!
god!
hi stranger!
long time!
I am michael.
we dated for a while.
oh hey!
dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while i talk to helene?
did i make more of what we had then what was really there?
just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules.
but had to end, because the summer was over.
for you... jerk.
real entertainers, like billy joel.
carroll, how are you?
I am great!
i saw your-your sign outside.
and i decided, I am going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
no.
weird... he sounds like a nice guy.
oh wow another living room!
you put the tv here, you put the family over here.
someone told me that i romanticize relationships i have herpes.
i just found out today.
it is, uh, right there.
mmhmm, I am sorry.
I am between specialists right now.
well i believe in love at first sight.
i knew what i was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
hi holly it is michael, i just wanted to call and let you know that i was thinking about what you said.
it is just.
you know?
it is weird.
today i ended up seeing a lot of women that i used to date, and in my mind they were all great.
and then when i actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show.
and you and me, that must have been a real train wreck.
you know what, holly?
you are wrong.
you are wrong.
i remember every second of us.
and talking to them today, i do not feel for them anything like what i feel for you.
i did not joke with any of them, i joked with you.
you are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me.
and i do not know why you downgraded what we had but i did not make us up.
ok.  oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes.
bye.
oscar, we once sucked face in public.
as part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing.
do you recall?
you may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
herpes duplex.
i have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
flower shops, fireworks celebrations... moolit gandala, carrage drive through central park... an electric car dealership.
oscar!
think abou- think!
look at that.
nice!
she is a beaut!
oh, look at that.
smooth roll.
oh, god!
yes, i can ride a bike.
i take spinning classes three times a month.
i think i know how to ride a bike.
i did, yes!
i had those extra wheels on the back...that support you.
mi-chael!
mi-chael!
oh, my god!
ow!
you never forget.
whoo!
brainstorming session is now open.
anyone has an idea- hold on.
sorry, sorry, sorry.
hello?
oh, hey.
no, I am not busy.
what is up?
it is jim, okay?
yes.
you need the big guns, yes?
i will see you in ten.
bye!
hold tight.
well, i know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did i...and the only reason i got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
no, i do not have time for this.
are you kidding me?
no!
okay.
all right.
oh, no, that is a male model.
that...hello.
michael scott, dunder-mifflin paper company.
nice to meet you.
yeah, well...we call it overkill.
why am i telling you my strategy?
all right.
buh-bye.
i could swear that guy was a male model.
oh, thank you.
all right.
on the count of three, it is showtime.
ready, one, two- okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
it is showtime!
oh...never mind.
let us go.
when i knock on your door, you know who it is; it is michael scott.
we have been together forever and we- you know what?
you are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not?
all right.
we are going to deliver to you on weekends.
and you know what else we are going to do?
i can not believe I am going to say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost.
i know.
i could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you would better shake my hand right now.
shake it, shake it!
okay.
thank you.
thanks, steve.
stop it.
just stop it.
we did what we should have done, we just got bested.
why is there a door close button if it does not even close the door?
how do i feel about losing the sale?
it is like if michael phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
you know who we always lose out to?
staples, the big guys.
osprey?
they are a small company.
they are smaller than we are.
what is our excuse?
how do we combat this guy?
stanley, how do we combat him?
okay.
you know what?
you clearly do not care, so why do not you just leave?
why do not you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
i do not know, your frame, your build-why do not you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you are not a diabetic.
see?
i could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay.
yes, phyllis?
oh, my god!
you know what this is?
this is a stinger.
like the movie.
paul newman, robert redford.
they are bank robbers.
shhh!
hey!
that is my mug.
yes.
oh, no, no.
no.
do not- testify.
yeah, he is that good-looking.
okay.
pull it together, all right?
stop lookin' at him.
oh...my god!
he is making her sell to him.
stay- oh!
do not let us down.
no, no, no....
I am goin 'in!
stop, stop!
oh, my god!
okay.
stop it, stop it, stop it.
gross!
stop it, please.
everybody, stop.
i said stop.
okay, danny...this is not pennsylvania solartech.
this is dunder-mifflin paper company.
this is meredith palmer- do not!
get away from him.
please, just leave.
get out of here.
go.
forever.
i owe you...a most sincere and humble apology.
we were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
a surveillance room next to this one.
yes.
and it is the sincerest form of flattery.
well- okay.
you know what, it was not just me.
jim and dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
no, we do not.
here is-here is my point.
danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this.
we just-we wanted to know your tricks.
you are, you are.
you are!
stop it, stop it.
stop.
you are a good salesman.
and because of that...i want you to work for me.
so, you will?
hold it, hold it.
hold on, hold on.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
wait.
wait.
danny, i want you to look at me.
do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
answer the question.
do you want a better life, danny?
i know, i know.
do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
i can give you more money-there is your better life.
i can let you come and go as you please-there is your freedom.
and you already know dunder-mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway.
can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
everyone, may i have your attention?
i would like to introduce you to mr. danny cordray.
he is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman.
say hello to danny!
of-kay.
you know what?
no.
no.
this is not some sort of construction site...or all of italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat.
we are to respect him.
i respect him because he reminds me of somebody.
can anybody guess who that is?
no.
no.
no.
somebody in this office.
no, me.
right?
sorta like...a little younger version of me.
yes.
no, you may not.
i said no.
we are not- okay.
let us-all right, all right.
let us talk.
please do not let him leave.
do not leave.
do not let him.
guys, let me ask you something.
do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
okay.
well...get ready, because it is going to get better.
no, no.
wrong.
he would have stolen your clients, but you know what?
he can not now.
this guy used to steal sales from us; now, he is going to steal sales for us.
he does not need to sit, he is a traveling salesman.
look, i am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you.
and unless you have a better argument than that, i suggest you leave.
good-bye!
this morning, danny cordray stole a sale from me.
so what do i do?
i go out and i steal danny cordray.
the sale that mattered, i made.
boom.
funny thing about it, we do not even need him.
we already have packer on the road.
chhguuh!
crap.
i forgot about packer.
all right, everybody, take a seat.
as you may have heard, our branch on the planet jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!
a lot of people are really getting into halloween this year!
six seconds, macgruber!
pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned!
uh, two seconds macgruber!
including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a ouija board... ohhh!
boom!
ohh explosion!
macgruberrrr!
macgruber!
oh, here we go!
oh!
who likes to water ski on lake erie?
no wai-where does dracula like to water ski?
so, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
blackula!
oh, so... i almost forgot.
you will find this hilarious.
apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now.
that is like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
yeah.
I am sorry.
i blew this.
you should have gotten credit for that, man.
really?
we are good?
okay.
okay.
oh.
it is a ream of paper.
thought you might hit me.
darryl philbin is the greatest guy in the world.
and you know what I would like?
i would like to have all the racists brought together and take darryl philbin out to lunch.
just to see what they are missing.
erin!
would you please do me a solid and get darryl philbin on the speakerphone?
hi, darryl, come out here, please.
you need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
yeah, i bet it is!
if you are going to do your job well here, you got to get used to being embarrassed.
this whole delivery slash sales idea?
you know whose idea that was?
that was darryl philbin's.
he thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
i got in the way.
i said no.
and it just stopped.
but then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what?
they need to know that it was yours.
and i do not care if i take a bullet.
we are going to call them, we are going to put them on speakerphone right now... and we are going to straighten this out.
mmhm!
I am a little peeved at darryl right now.
no, he did not go behind my back.
he went over my head.
what is taking someone from behind?
it was a good idea, though.
what the hell are they talking about?
do you think that kevin is going over my head?
i do not- oh my god.
okay.
all right.
all right.
you know what?
that is inappropriate, kevin.
i am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then i take it to gabe.
chain of command.
do you understand?
oh, you are sorry?
what did you just thought?
all right.
okay.
well, do not let it happen again.
i- okay, this whole going over my head-gate?
is making people act weird.
the chain of command is crumbling.
do you know what just happened?
i just made kevin cry.
and gabe looks like lady gaga.
that is not halloween.
halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
you went over my head.
and then you lied to my face.
so my head and my face have taken a beating.
okay, that might help.
if you said "I am sorry" in front of everybody.
in front of me.
so that is it.
is it?
yeah, i got to get in on this.
hey, it is cool, man, i work in the warehouse!
I am cool!
I am hip and I am jive!
and i do not care about nobody!
do you know who i am?
happy halloween, jerk!
still do not know who i am?
I will give you a hint.
i go over other people's heads.
what is a bad idea?
never!
okay, you know what?
fine.
I am not darryl.
and thank god I am not darryl.
hey, can i play?
why do not you ask if darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
aaah!
darryl moved it.
you moved it.
dwight, you saw darryl move it, right?
if you had one word you would use to describe darryl what would that word be?
thank you.
if they are good ideas, I am not going to say no!
that was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything i did for you?
oh... well... stop it!
stop, stop.
we are thinking.
we are thinking about it.
you do not have to point to the fact that we are thinking about it.
stop it!
just let us think.
okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
i am not budging on the hat issue.
okay.
we both reserve the right to go to jo if we disagree with gabe.
unless you and i decide we want to talk to jo, then we will give her a call.
sorry i was a jerk.
friends fight.
friends fight.
that is true, that is true.
i dated her momma, and you know what- um... kay.
uh, alright.
top of the sunday morning to you.
oh, yes.
doobie-doobie doo.
i invited everyone in the office because it is not a day for just jim or pam or the baby or me.
it is about us all.
and i thought we should all celebrate... my joy.
and our, all of ours joys.
hey.
hey.
i got an offer that you can not refuse.
scooch over.
but I am the godfather.
are you talking to me?
scooch.
before i shoot you in the head.
yeah.
I am not the godfather.
so who is the godfather?
okay.
old friend, like, you have known him since kindergarten?
no, i have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats.
enjoy the show.
i do not even know how to say this, but cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. and that is not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
good morning.
jim and pam and cece really seem to be clicking.
they are totally gelling.
it is as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness.
and good for them.
that is great, because, you know, the paper industry's not going to last forever.
good morning.
good morning.
how are you?
good morning.
good morning.
i am feeling this.
call it the holy spirit or the passion of the christ.
i am loving these people.
oh, after you.
no, i insist.
after me.
thank you.
you too.
you know what, guys, let us just enjoy lunch.
shh.
no.
hey, dwight.
dwight, hey.
are you kidding me?
stop it.
shh.
look at that.
look at that.
that is fun.
we need to do stuff together outside of work.
let us go help africa.
let us go build an airport.
we will start small.
we will have a car wash. we will send some cheerleaders to regionals.
yeah, well, that is just a pick-up scene.
okay, we do not have to volunteer.
but i think we should hang out more together.
look at these people.
these are church-going people.
and they know how to party.
well, it is, it is- no.
okay, you know what?
this is inappropriate.
what is wrong with you guys?
what is wrong with you?
what is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice?
why did you guys even come today?
what is so great about your lives that you think you are better than everybody else?
that you can make fun of everybody else?
you are mean.
you are mean girls.
like the movie, mean girls.
and kevin and stanley, if you do not stop worrying so much about what you are going to put in your gullet, you are going to die in about a month.
bye.
good luck.
good luck to you.
bye.
do good.
do good.
bye.
have fun.
we are proud of you.
bye.
okay.
hey.
hey.

I will take a shirt.
if you will have me, yes.
really?
thank you.
all right.
no, I am not.
I am staying on the bus.
I am already on the bus.
I am going.
it is not irresponsible!
i have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
you know what, my job will be here when i get back.
hey, right?
tell them that i died, and i turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
tell them that I am in a meeting.
no, you may not.
thank you.
see you in a few months.
mm.
that is not going to happen.
well, you know what, everybody thinks that i am crazy, and that tells me that i am the sanest person i know.
so... how long till we get to mexico?
ooh.
what are we building down there again?
like, a hospital?
a school for mexicans?
what?
why are not they building it themselves?
do we know how?
i do not know how.
you know how?
carla knows.
oh, i feel like there were so many more people on this bus.
there were, like, 200, 300 people before.
hey, carla?
carla?
hi.
what are you doing?
what is happening?
oh, god, what is happening?
oh, god, you know what?
I am going to be in mexico for my half-birthday.
and cinco de mayo.
no, we-no.
you know how these things go.
construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums have not even started.
now we are those lazy bums.
i got to get off this bus.
can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
do that.
do it.
okay, driver, driver, if you are not going to stop this bus, then I am going to stop it for you.
okay?
hang on.
yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
stop the bus, okay?
i did not sign up for this.
you guys are young, that is great.
you want to give back to society.
I have done that.
i need to take.
blah-di-blah!
we could go back and forth all day.
it is not going to solve anything.
do you want that for little jessica?
no, you do not.
and the answer is clear.
stop the bus.
okay?
okay, well, a pleasure.
go save the world.
we will keep an eye on america for you.
why quick?

uh huh... big... all right!
okay okay okay.
gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz.
i just have a different life style.
they have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag.
so I will get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the tv, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I am ready for bed!

better men than gabe have tried to be my boss.
david got fired.
charles got fired.
jan went crazy.
ed truck, who i liked, got decapitated.
yeah, well i was not very hard to find.

oh do not raise your voice to me!
gahh, i will pull this car over!
if you break that girl's heart, i will kill you.
it is just a figure of speech.
but seriously, if you break that girl's heart i will literally kill you and your entire family.
gabe, just go and have fun with erin.
but not too much fun!
that girl's going to turn my hair gray.
my bad.
space heater and fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
uh... try "password".
uh... it was like eight years ago?
okay, moving backwards, our i.t.
guys have been...  glasses, turban, ear hair, fatty 3, shorts, fatty 2, lozenge, and fatso.
i think lozenge was the one who installed it.
you know what?
it made me laugh when i heard it, but pam got really offended.
the important thing is... this kept us secure people.
morning.
I am facebook.
i sent you a facebook message yesterday, i still have not heard anything back.
a what?
dot com!
i think an investor's ski trip is the best idea.
it will be a bonding experience.
i was looking at a trail map, and i was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I have never actually been skiing.
and then work our way up to death drop.
your kidding?!
you and me.
do not you work here full-time?
mm-hmm.
that does sound fun to me.
excuse me, everyone... sex!
now that i have your attention... money!
pervert.
that is good to know.
wuphf!
all right, I have warmed them up for you.
you have the floor, ryan.
whoo!
we already have a buyer.
at least.
that is right!
wait, ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
no, not this weekend; next weekend.
we were going to go on the investors ski trip.
i bought poles.
look at that.
triple your investment by january.
there you go.
do not talk like that, stanley.
here we go.
"it is ryan the wuphf guy!" "he is up there." look at that!
he threw  them on the ground!
no, it is not weird, andy, and you know what else?
we have an offer from washington university.
so monetize that.
i will not sell.
and you know what?
ryan and i have the majority of shares.
is not that right?
i-yes.
we are not selling.
i will not sell.
can not talk, saving the planet.
we do not?
well, why have i been separating the trash into whites and colors?
eight years.
no, i will not even consider it.
right, yes, yeah.
best friend/mentor.
i think you are wrong.
you may be right.
i may be crazy.
I am just saying that i think i agree with your point.
i thought it might make me feel better.
but it just may be a lunatic...  no.
good, good, bro.
always have your back.
so, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
nine days, though.
that is, like... yes, you have tapped this.
hard.
maybe i could take a second mortgage on my condo.
so you would think that is a good idea for me to do?
mm-hmm.
yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so... tonight?
oh right.
what am i saying?
rain check.
hello.
i. do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
I am not blind!
i know exactly who he is.
he is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend.
and he is also clever.
and he shoots incredibly high.
and he may just make it.
but you know what?
even if he does not, i would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway.
and there is no middle ground.
only if he fails.
and you know what?
ryan, i believe in you.
just like i believe in all of you.
you have nine days to save everybody's money.
you can not have it.
the world sends people your way... ryan came to me through a temp agency.
andy was transferred here.
no idea where creed came from.
the point is you just have to play with the cards that you are dealt.
jim, that guy is an ace.
dwight is my king up my sleeve.
phyllis is my old maid.
oscar is my queen.
that is easy.
give me a hard one.
that is what oscar said.
toby is the instruction card you throw away.
pam's a solid seven.
and yeah, you know what?
ryan is probably, like, a two.
but sometimes twos can be wild.
so watch out.
and i am obviously the joker.
so...  that is uh... thank god.
mmhmm, china.
china.
it was great.
china.
everything here was made in china, pam.
they used to make stuff in america, andy.
but we are falling behind, did you know that?
china is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
yeah, right here.
it is right there.
anybody read the news any more?
i found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office.
this kid had the magazine i wanted to read, that is the only one i could reach and i read it and then i read it again.
my whole life i believed that america was number one, that was the saying.
not america is number two.
england is number two.
china should be like eight.
what?
so much for keeping our secrets up high.
i know what we are going to do.
we are going to put our best minds on it.
everybody stop working.
i want you all to imagine a world in which america is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello.
now open your eyes.
welcome to your future.
how do we stop it?
with a big idea.
that is what america is built on, big ideas.
blue jeans, the grand canyon.
whose got one, whose got a big idea?
yes, indeed.
yes kevin.
once a week antacid is the idea to beat.
anyone else?
nobody?
okay then we are... yes.
i do not know.
alright.
i do not know what the  that was.
no he is not right.
we are not.
where would we even drop it, phyllis?
did you know that in china there are fifty six cities with over a million people?
you know how many we have here?
nine.
no, no.
that is right now.
in terms of land, not population.
no, no you are wrong about this.
i got it from newyorktimes.com so i happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office.
so what?
i do not care.
okay, now where were we before i bested oscar?
absolutely, pam this is exactly why i hired you as office administrator, handle it.
taking care of business.
very comedically humorous jim.
try 'control p'.
not if the printer is not hooked up.
you are making some very dangerous assumptions oscar.
hey.
mmm.
yeah.
sure.
coffee jim.
yes.
alright, well i just need to learn everything about china.
to be safe i should learn everything about everything but i do not have time.
okay, okay, I will just learn about china and science and geography and math and literary.
I am pretty good on politics.
"california is bankrupt, and california, california."  what?
pass.
pass.
lifeline.
i could talk about boobs.
i bet he knows nothing about boobs.
wait, wait, wait.
how long is this going to take?
is it going to be worth it?
i do not need to cheat.
did you know, that china has a new missile, that can sink a us naval carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
did you also know that china has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal.
but what do i know, i mean, that is just according to the pentagon.
our pentagon.
china has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars.
we are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives.
and they will control us.
how then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in china has risen by 17% and in the us it has only risen by 8%?
do not... i... yeah, i figured that.
wait.
you forgetting something?
this chat.
two men, one white, one latina.
a boss and a money cruncher.
i could fire you.
here we are.
my point is... that as long as people like you and me do not stop talking, nobody can stop the usa.
i am talking about freedom, about choice.
america, i do not think you need to worry.
because if you want to beat china you will.
if you do not, that is fine.
that my friend, is your victory.
y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to china, and that may be the true, but what they do not tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend.
so here is to conversation.
raise your cups on high.
case closed.
people, wait, wait, wait.
come back, come back.
one fun one.
we are going to do a fun one.
that is it!
that is a picture!
yes!
jump in the air.
we are going to jump in the air.
here we go.
okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please.
here we go.
do not answer that.
people, listen up and listen good.
we need to just get one picture where we are all in the air at the same time.
yes?
i believe in us.
we can do this.
here we go.
we did not get it.
oh, ho, ho, ho!
oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
merry christmas, little children!
how is everybody doing today?
how is the party coming along?
are we over budget?
no?
good.
did anyone get drunk already?
good for you.
angela, lay it on me.
what is the problem?
so stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
alright.
well, i will be in my office making toys for the good children.
andy?
What are you got?
well, that is a relief.
santa's going to take some much-needed free time.
alright.
good!
my kids are growin up.
as a boss, i look at that and say great.
it is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that is what i want.
that is what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful christmas with no drama.
yeah!
pam?
pam?
hi.
uh, because you have been on the lam?
because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack.
and the verdict, it was toby.
and the sentence, death.
death to toby!
you know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences.
what do you expect me to do?
that was the worst joke ever.
okay.
okay goodbye, goodbye.
what?
what?
hold on, holly's coming back here?
that is a great question, erin.
how do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
you know what, we will postpone this party until then.
this is too important.
cancel this one.
dwight get rid of the tree.
cancel.
we are canceling it.
no, we have to cancel the party.
no, no, no, we are going to get fresh for holly.
fresh and new.
i know.
it is not.
they are not.
fresh and new.
please let go.
please let go.
well then everybody'll chip in, it will be fine.
you know what, I will pay for it.
I will pay for the party.
it does not matter.
this is way too important.
people, holly's coming back, and this is the most important christmas party of my life.
so back to work.
man, i worked hard.
i worked so hard for this!
i was after corporate constantly.
i emailed joe.
i wrote letters.
and, know who i end up owing this to is the scranton strangler.
thank you.
thank you, scranton strangler.
i love you!
you just took one more person's breath away.
we have always had good christmas parties here, as you know, but they have never been cool.
the name is bond... santa bond.
I will have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred.
classic brosnan.
santa... wonderful tradition.
everybody loves santa.
everybody can not get enough of the jolly old man.
but that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard.
he is not necessarily an old guy.
no one knows what the real santa claus... god!
ow!
well, this year's going to be different.
we are going to have fun.
it is not going to be tacky.
it is going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere.
it is not going to be tacky, deli platter food.
it is not going to have a big, fat, gross santa claus.
it is going to be cool, sleek santa.
okay.
sure.
you never know about the press.
could he help us with some parking tickets?
well, then he is not a senator.
okay.
okay...  oh, no, no, no, no!
fake tree.
no, no!
pam, no, no.
holly's coming from new hampshire.
somebody from new hampshire looks at that and thinks it is a burning cross.
no, no.
i want you to go and get a real tree.
take some money.
thank you.
yes, that is me.
come on it.
there is nothing classier than boring jazz music.
i am here to tell ya.
and i made a bit of a judgment call.
i hired one musician, because i thought, what is better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
when holly gets here, i want you to be very helpful to her.
she does not need an internet presence, you just know.
what the hell are you doing here?
you are supposed to be in the courthouse.
and then he will come back here and replace holly, so stop asking him questions.
there she is.
hey.
erin, would you help her, for god's sake?
hello.
well, i never thought I would see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
why, you are some sorta wise guy, huh?
nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!
d'oh!
hi.
hi.
oh... oh no, not the huggy monster!
i do not want to die!
i do not want to die!
i do not want to die!
wow.
well, everybody, you remember holly.
that is adorable.
well, you came on the day of our christmas party.
is not it wonderful?
we love it here.
do not you love it?
all right, let me show you to your desk.
i show you to your desk.
what kind of guns do you have?
six-shooter?
this is weird.
i can not believe you are here.
this feels like you never left.
does not it?
oh... oh, and you have a woody.
bah!
oh, i love toy... well, that is understandable.
still raw.
woody your favorite character?
you know who my favorite character in toy story is?
andy's mom.
because without andy's mom, there is no plot.
and without any plot, there is no movie.
you are kidding me.
ahh!
what a douche bag!
get a... yeah!
good riddance.
mmhmm.
good for him.
really?
that is creepy.
how did aj get in your house?
oh, you do?
yeah, randy newman's the best.
me too.
hey.
hey there, jada.
nice to see you again.
I am santa claus.
welcome.
it is a sophisticated take.
yeah, well, i was told that holly would be here, single and ready to date.
and we all got misled.
nora ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
i guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you do not.
and that is just the way it is.
and i can be mature about that.
what if meredith was taking her smoking break below that window?
you know what would have happened?
the shards of glass would have shaved her face right off.
and, yes, it might have been funny.
but it also would have been incredibly tragic.
all this arguing reminds me of a very funny story.
you see this on my desk?
know who gave me this?
my girlfriend tara, who lives in new york city.
i have not told you about her.
I am a man in my mid-40s and i still get zits.
i think that is pretty interesting.
but you know what?
i am not on trial here.
the scranton strangler is.
so, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to jfk, but i am flying out of laguardia.
so we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slo-mo, drinking latte.
and at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab." i do.
she is.
did you see her face?
well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for michael g. scott.
and it are not tara.
what happened?
what happened?
toby, what did you do?
i think toby's very jealous of all the attention you have been getting.
oh, really?
turn it on me.
well, is not that nice?
thank you very much.
it is christmas.
mmhmm.
mmhmm.
well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me.
and that i have been framed.
ahhhhhh!
surprise!
it was part of the party.
pretty funny, huh?
i do not.
but someday i think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids... all right.
shh.
okay, you know what?
holly, i did not mean to do it.
it was an accident.
an accident borne of jealous feelings.
oh, really?
you certainly seemed jealous when i told you about my fake girlfriend.
that is what jim and dwight thought.
when you got transferred, and i drove you up to nashua, you said, "michael, i love you, but i can not do this." but then, with this other guy, you do not have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you?
and you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
and we did this whole stupid party for you.
mmm.
erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
hey nice to see you again, aj.
welcome.
good trip down?
good, good.
good to see you.
have fun.
enjoy the partay.
i am dead inside.
oh, hey, hey, no, do not run.
you are going to slip.
yup.
i read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever.
and then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
yeah, well, at least he was married.
no, it is not.
it is not.
oh, man, i can tell you confidently that it is not going to be okay.
really?
no.
yeah.
i mean, i can wait till then.
come here.
i do not want you to fall.
i was in the mall, and i saw that, and i thought it had your name written all over it.
no, that is not... no, i went to the mall and i picked that out especially for you.
from the mall.
that... well, that... hey.
oh.
thank you.
a hostess apple pie!
this is my favorite breakfast.
how did you know that?
thank you very much.
oh, you know, i seem to remember that santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for christmas.
did not he say that?
i think i know where he is.
mmhmm.
video games.
a dsi?
a horse.
you, are you sure you do not want a pony?
you want a real horse?
all right.
you have to pick up after them.
january three, 2011. a day which will live in-famously.
holly partridge flax, otherwise known as holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man.
this is freaking me out.
i- okay, let us switch to the happy video, okay?
no, no, no, no, let us push through.
we will do this.
today will either be the best or the worst day of my life.
holly gave aj an ultimatum.
he either proposes by new year's or they break up.
now, if she is engaged, I am going to go crazy, and I am going to start attacking people.
if she is not engaged, in all honesty, i may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness.
either way, i am going to need some talking down.
and nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
michael, i know what you are thinking.
holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself.
it may seem like a good idea, but it is not.
okay, so killing yourself.
i was just thinking about snot.
happy.
sad.
to soak up my tears.
bears sad, worms happy.
come on, erin.
sad, something to break.
for you, job well done.
both sad.
i did!
i did, indeed.
two front row center, to paula poundstone, live in poughkeepsie.
holly's favorite.
i hope she does not call us up on stage.
that would suck.
"hey, you think you can do my job better?" i do not know.
"what is your name?" michael.
shaaa-shut up.
hello.
so... high five me.
we are back.
to a happy...  look at those!
mittens.
are those a present?
they are so fuzzy and warm!
let me feel those.
let me feel that.
put 'er there.
give me a good firm... ooh!
that is a good firm handshake.
you are hired!
yes, let us get right into the anderson account, shall we?
yes, yes, right away.
yes, no, why?
stop!
yes.
oh my god!
that is it!
that is it!
happy!
happy, happy, happy, happy!
I am trying!
I am trying!
what?
I am not listening to music!
go!
oh, that is nice.
me?
okay.
I am good.
oh my god!
hello!
oh, somebody is got a new phone!
that is neat.
e.t.
phone holly.
holly like phone?
why?
bummer.
reese's pieces.
i still have my old phone.
this thing... indestructible.
holly does not seem to be engaged, but she is talking to aj like she is.
i can not figure it out.
do you think she is already dating a different aj?
when you broke it off with roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
but you did still love him.
do you love him now?
no.
she would just resent me.
or worse!
she would think of me as her friend.
oh, hi friend!
blegh.
you think she would talk to you?
that is true.
she is really nice.
she would talk to anybody.
why do not you bring erin to balance you out?
or sooner.
that is not a joke.
is it?
next year?
come-i mean, what is the point?
what is the point of that?
i made a resolution to floss, and i did it.
12:01, january first, bam!
blood everywhere.
what is wrong with you people?
can not you stick to anything?
erin, i want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables.
creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel?
nothing's stopping you.
come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
you are just going to somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what is going to be on your tombstone?
loser.
just do a cartwheel!
eat it.
no.
no cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it.
come on.
here comes the airplane, there you go.
open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
eat it.
put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
i do not care whether you hate it!
you said you would do it!
eat it!
all right, all right, shh!
let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth.
under your tongue.
oh, god!
you guys are pathetic.
no!
you can not have any candy!
holly flax.
not michael, e.t.
well, i just want to talk about what happened in there.
holly, come on in.
thanks for coming.
i thought there should be an hr rep here for this.
so, kevin and creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
and i wanted to apologize.
these resolutions should be about you, and i made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
it was insensitive and i am sorry.
i really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions.
the cartwheel, the veggies... i... care about you.
very much.
and you loom so large in my heart that i crossed the line.
you are right.
and i hope that we can still be friends.
okay, oh!
all right.
okay.
no.
yup.
you can toss them.
my resolution?
i never want to make holly cry again.
unless it is from laughing too hard.
or making love too beautifully.
look at where you are going to be doing the cartwheel.
so look at where you are going to be placing your hands.
so pick a spot.
you ready to do this?
you know what?
I am going to stay here as long as it takes.
it is about you.
it is about you.
go!
you did?
okay.
congratulations.
all right.
well, all right.
see you tomorrow.
oh, sorry, mate.
excuse me.
mate.
english?
oh no no, I am not picking on you at all.
you are english, correct?
I am working on an english character.
would you mind gi...  it is called reginald pooftah.
michael scott.
i do ping.
herrow.
i ping!
no, no, no.
and people do not understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
that is good.
pleasure to meet you.
dunder mifflin.
no, not right now.
all right.
see you around.
bye-bye.
what a nice guy.
hello, i am here for the small business seminar.
nein!
I am greek!
my name is mikanos.
okay.
i am the plant.
every great seminar has one.
my job is to make the speaker look good, and i do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes.
and the character "mikanos", is just a little added flava.
"mikanos" is loosely based on another character i do, "spiros", who is more about the ladies.
you know what might be kind of fun?
i was thinking , you know andy is having a seminar today?
what if we went in as a greek couple?
mikanos and... okay.
holly broke up with a.j last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me.
to holly, it is been the worst week of her life, and i know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever.
too much information?
that is what i thought.
but, you know what?
here i am using it.
if-a you change-a you mind, why do not you talk to mikanos?
ugh.
you are the fifth person to tell me that today.
okay, yeah, like a character history.
good.
tom hanks does that.
practice olympics.
i like the musical "grease", or as we call it, "home".
hello.
she will have a greekaccino.
it... i can not believe-ee.
it is a miracle.
she can talk!
no more brain damage!
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
you know, i like you.
I am going to give you my secret gyro recipe.
come out here since it is a secret, and I will tell you.
all, you have to close right now.
no, you are not.
you are getting past it.
you have to close.
you can do it.
andy, what is the problem?
you, kelly and creed, kevin, they believe in you.
do not let them down.
do not let yourself down, andy.
I am going to go back in.
I am going to stall them for a little bit.
i want you to get your head together, and then come back in.
i want you to close.
what is taking that guy so long?
no, no, no.
almost as good as the first day when we first met.
you are the love of my life.
come to me, necropolis.
put your lips on my lips.
come on.
what?
come on.
it is time for grapes.
real fun day.
just a minute.
how long do we have to wait?
you broke up with aj weeks ago.
i do not understand.
i really do not.
i mean, we know we are going to start dating.
why not now?
sure we do.
why does the sun rise in the morning?
why do magnets stick together?
because everybody says so.
everybody.
yeah, i understand.
i just do not agree.
yes i do.
yes i do.
i have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
let us go.
let us go!
just drive faster.
i want to get back.
okay, fine.
my feelings do not matter to you.
what matters to you is your precious speed limit.
no I am not.
I am not in a bad mood.
I am not, jim.
hello?
ok fine, ignore me.
have it your way.
let us just talk about you, as always.
is sex different after the baby, jim?
i need to pee.
yeah, i do.
my word against yours.
what part of "i need to pee" do you not understand?
I am upset.
my bladder is full.
there is no telling what i might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
well i hope i make it.
i know, i know you have a phone policy.
i understand.
but this is an emergency because my friend is not here and i am worried that he has been abducted.
there is no way he ditched me.
there is no way that happened.
he is my... ok. may i please just use your phone?
please!
ok. i will make it quick.
i will make it very quick.
and you do not have my numbers on speed dial.
ah, ok. what is it?
you know what, i can dial 411, get jim's number.
actually this is good.
i am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about.
good.
good.
nope, get away.
no, that is enough.
ok. hey you guys.
listen to me.
do not get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there.
look over there.
see?
they look cute.
hello!
you guys are so beautiful.
you are so colorful.
i wish i could understand you.
that is a metaphor i guess.
you are disgusting.
you will never find love.
yekkk.
do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen?
I am being serious.
seriously.
hello.
i would like a hot dog please.
now, i do not have any money so here is what i would like to do.
i leave you here with my watch, and i come back later to pay for the hot dog.
well i understand that but this is a $45 watch.
with that i can buy... half the menu.
all right.
what do you do with the hog dogs that you do not sell?
well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why do not you just throw one away now into my mouth?
okay.
you have just lost my business.
oh, boy.
that was yummy.
thank you so much.
you know what?
i think i left my wallet in my car.
do you mind if i run out and get it?
okay.
I will be right back.
.
okay.
you know what?
I am sorry.
I am sorry.
i do not have my wallet and i was going to try to dine and dash and that was stupid and i realize i can not do that to you fine people.
well i can, but i will have to come back later tonight and pay you.
but the point is i did the right thing.
well the number three is not such a giant feast.
i am not.
i just have had a bad day.
and i... okay.
I will be back later with the money.
I am just going to leave right now.
well, i think i can get through the door.
hi.
how did you know i was up here?
i got turned around.
i thought i could see dunder mifflin.
yeah.
wow.
i just miss you so much.
really?
can i kiss you?
okay.
miss you.
okay.
I will be in my office if you need me.
okay, bye.
bye.
all right, bye.
bye... bye.
do not go.
i do not want you to go.
oh do not go.
do not go.
holly and i are dating.
it is been a week, and i still can not believe it.
it goes to show that everything you want in life, you get.
and you can not work for it.
it just comes to you.
are these numbers correct?
okay.
are you... are you sick, oscar?
do you need to go home?
because you are grossing me out.
sit.
okay, just close your eyes.
oh, yeah.
yes.
michael scott, dunder mifflin.
what is the purpose of this meeting?
perfect.
yes.
it is quite apro-propriate.
carry on.
what, are you talking about me and holly?
whispering and tickling have their place in business.
i... okay, yeah, that is pretty hot.
i will give you that.
look, you are all hypocrites.
you all do it.
thank you.
all right.
okay.
fine.
no more pda.
you win.
but here is what we are going to do.
we are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
anything goes.
okay, then we have two closets.
no, no, we are going to have three closets, one for each base, no homers.
yes?
pro.
what?
problem solved.
no, no, it is great.
i love working at dunder mifflin, a division of taliban enterprises.
ah, the old "leave behind." oldest trick in the book.
good thing it is working.
since when is comfort the most important thing?
i mean, i do not... i do not sit on your lap because it is comfortable.
i sit on your lap because i like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
oh.
okay.
well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we will stop.
holly and i are like romeo and juliet.
and this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
hey, you know why people here are complaining?
they are jealous of two people in love on valentine's day.
i love you.
i love you-love you.
i am really disappointed in the office's policy on pda at this moment.
i love you.
yeah, whatever.
no big deal.
just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
hello, holly.
here, shake.
no!
no, we can not.
no touching.
ah, I am trying not to touch you.
oh.
oh, no, so close.
oh.
no, we can not do that.
we can not do this.
ohh.
i do not know what your body feels like because i can not touch it.
grab you here.
i will grab you here anyway.
never.
i did say i would, but i was wrong.
i can not stop.
you do not what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back.
it is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
yes, it was that.
it is that one.
we are not supposed to pda.
i have not thought about you having to go back to nashua.
that is what we said last time.
remember?
we broke up on the drive.
how is this going to be any different?
i was in love with you.
it is like a time bomb... ...is ticking down.
when it goes off, no more kissing.
no more hugging.
sexual time bomb.
boner bomb starring jason statham.
or we go against type with an eisenberg or a michael cera.
no.
saving the world has never been this hard.
no, i can not talk to her.
i can not even look at her without thinking about it ending.
do the monkey face.
i love that.
i love that face.
no.
the monkey!
do not do the squirrel.
throw your poop.
that is good.
that is good.
he is throwing it.
i know.
holly.
hey.
holly, i love you so, so, so much.
and i think we need to break up.
actually, it is valentine's day.
should not be doing this today.
I will talk to you tomorrow.
you are going to go back to nashua eventually, and i can not handle it.
so let us just...let us... who?
okay.
okay.
ladies and gentlemen, i have an announcement to make.
as of today, officially, holly and i are moving into together.
yay!
thank you.
thank you.
oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down.
you could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for pda here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best valentine's day present that a person could receive.
so i bid you all adieu.
i do.
what are our plans for tonight?
umm... leave it at reception.
clean up on aisle five.
</i> after three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, i have finally completed my movie, threat level: midnight.
erin... what are you doing?
that is... that is.
well, do not put words in my mouth.
sweet, i will go invite holly.
mhmm!
it is got action, it is got heart, it is got some bosom.
it is got a lot of me.
ladies and gentleman, threat level: midnight.
dwight does not play a robot.
I am up.
tell him I am retired.
goldenface, this makes it personal.
</i> heads i do it, tails i do not.
best out of seven.
heads.
tails.
...heads...tails...heads...tails.
well, it looks like there is going to be a clean-up on aisle five.</i> I am not here to learn how to mop, I am here to learn how to play hockey.
what am i supposed to do with this?
nice try goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me.
no!
yeah?
</i> i am sorry that i have to do this... I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.</i> not who, what.
the funky cat is the hippest jazz club in town.
jack blaise.</i> by far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie.
but, it was integral to the story.
the joke's on you goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.
he said, where is the bomb?
why are you telling me this?
hey goldenface.
go puck yourself!
that was not scripted.
it will take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill michael scarn.
for the insurance money!
i knew it all along!
you will never get away with this!
</i> i got problems billy.
big problems... do not ever change billy.
goldenface is going to blow up the nhl all star game tomorrow.
no billy, i have not done that dance since my wife died.
well my name's michael scarn and I am here to say, I am about to do the scarn in a major way.
you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand.
you meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that is how you do the scarn!
you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand.
you meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that is how you do the scarn!
you jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand.
you meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that is how you do the scarn!
well that is a... pretty good reaction.
pretty cool, right?
did you like it?
did you like that?
okay.
no, it is not good enough.
it is not good enough... hey.
mmmm, good?
everybody out there says it is great!
did you?
what did you love about it?
no, no.
holly, this is not ocean's eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and do not care about how it turns out.
what did you really think, honestly.
is it, is it because you are afraid of where this is going to take me?
see, because i need you... to keep me grounded.
it was eleven years, okay?
this has been my dream for eleven years, and if you do not think it is great than you are basically saying that you do not believe in my dream.
i talk about a lot of things, holly!
i was eventually going to get around to my dream!
obviously!
eleven years i could have been working on the scarn nebulus.
because, if i do not have this, what do i have?
i have nothing.
i have my book on business, somehow i manage.
i have my hbo comedy special, here i go again dot-dot-dot.
but you know what?
when i think about it, when i really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
yeah, you are a real pain in the ass.
and I am going to go watch the movie with people who think it is great!
and I am sorry i called you a pain in the ass, I am angry, and i love you.
i am a huge woody allen fan.
although I have only seen antz, but I will tell you something.
what i respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how antz was just a rip-off of a bug's life, he stayed true to his films.
or at least the film that i saw which again was antz.
the thing is... i thought bug's life was better, much better.
than ants.
the point is, do not listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
who likes threat level: midnight?
okay then who wants to watch the rest?!
i know, it is a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!
this one's for you cherokee jack.
</i> we filmed this during an actual scranton high school hockey game, trying to qualify for states.
no, no!
actually it is really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game.
undefeated season.
that is why there were so many people there.
hey... no it is not.
it is not.
but, they really seem to be enjoying it.
oh yeah, i guess i did let him be a robot.
hello sir.
ugh...  I am in.</i> oh yeah!
yes he is!
no, no dwight.
he is just being stupid.
still not seeing the problem here.
it was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times.
and now packer wants to come home.
and ohh, look who is here to sign off on it!
my boo, holly.
hi.
oh, michael!
this'll be just us.
oh, yes yes yes yes.
just so you know, he is at his funniest when you have given him five shots.
and it also helps if you have had five shots.
whoa!
is packer here?
do not know, do not care.
yes!
the pack is back!
ladies and gentlemen, i would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him.
just kidding he would not be interested in any of you.
in all seriousness, todd packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch.
and i would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
you did!
you got burned, because packer's back!
packer is turning in his car for a desk.
he is turning in his condoms, for a condominium!
although he is probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
special delivery for dwight k. schrute.
and i do not have anything for you.
but i do want to talk to you about something.
we have been thinking about where packer should sit... and we can not just sit around and wait for creed to die.
so you would not mind permanently relocating, so that packer can take this desk here.
let us look at this.
do not be a baby!
okay!
there it is.
packer was here and so was your mom!
[todd starts humping dwight and michael who are still under the desk.
no!
best day ever.
best day ever!
question, should i get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
please.
yeah, you love him right?
you love him.
i can tell.
no.
not me, him.
whoa!
look, are you jealous of him?
because you think he is funnier than you?
oh honey... he is funnier than me.
so I am less funny than not funny at all?
uhm... that is insane!
and you made hank smile, that does not happen often.
you are very charming.
that is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter.
i do not know, holly mentioned that there were some complaints.
and that you had said some things about kevin.
yeah.
i guess you said something weird about your daughter?
you have been on the road a long time.
and you have been an outdoor cat.
and now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can not be peeing all over the walls.
no it is not.
yeah, a little bit.
i will not.
okay, every body.
i need you to see this.
because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you.
todd packer, is going to apologize.
kevin!
front and center, come here.
kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
okay, sweetie, no.
you should not be apologizing to packer.
that does not make any sense.
you ready for this?
you ready for this?
gentlemen, start your engines.
kevin, do you accept the apology?
okay, go back to the annex.
that-that was maybe too much.
packer is a survivor of divorce stanley.
packer does not speak with his child, meredith.
packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, andy.
angela loves pussy cats, and packer loves- i was going to say dogs!
okay, you know what, this is over!
apology has been issued!
and we are through with it.
packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
what are you doing?
i cannot believe this, you are sending packer to florida?
why?
okay, so you are tricking him into flying to florida?
you have to tell him.
you have to tell him what you did.
he is my oldest friend, i am going to tell him.
yes, about that.
well... i do not know if that is a good idea.
no, nothing like that at all.
sorry?
sounds great.
that is.
it is going to be awesome.
i think you are really going to enjoy it down there.
nah, he is an ass.
you ahh.
no you ahh.
you ahh.
i uh... i actually do not know why i brought that because it is kind of priceless.
mhmm, no i paid 500 dollars for that.
500. get lost.
that is how you do it.
you know it is really more for a bachelor pad.
i just want to get a fair price.
in case... in case of what?
i do not have an in case.
do you have an in case?
get lost.
yes, hello mr. flax this is michael scott, your daughter's boss.
i am calling because i am going to have to fire your daughter holly because she is such a terrible employee.
I am just kidding.
I am kidding.
I am actually calling because I am in love with her.
i love your daughter, and i have for some time.
and i would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me.
and i was just hoping you would give me your approval.
and this is not a joke.
so call me back, when you get this.
and i look forward to speaking.
thank you.
hi.
oh, you know what, you have a siphon?
i think I am going to run out of gas.
well, I am writing a message.
I am asking holly a question in fire.
maybe.
hey you know what?
I have got gas all over my hands and my shoes.
would you light it?
would you do the honors please?
pam.
i am not in the mood for riddles pam.
no, this is romantic.
why?
i did?
ok. thank you all for coming.
i would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
yes.
i could not have agreed with you more.
yes.
thank you.
no, no, no, no.
my minds made up i am not going to change my mind you can not talk me out of it.
i had a great idea until you ruined it.
how about this i throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' i lost my head when i fell in love with you.' it is easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school.
i already have the ring.
here is the ring.
yeah.
i saved 3 years salary.
is she not going to like that?
at a gas station?
that mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
oh yea you did not say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect.
i want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
i just... it is terrifying.
i know but I am still scared i do not know why.
get this... kevin thought i was going to sell my bowflex for 200 dollars and i told him 'dude this was a prop in my movie.' ok it is because we have not sold anything.
you know what?
we just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they are going to pay anything.
oh ok. for how long?
is he alright?
you ok?
yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
ok. no, no, shhhhut it.
mhmm.
oh god.
nope, nope, nope.
no.
i am not going to be proposed to in the break room.
that is not going to be our story.
mhm hm.
should have burned this place down when i had the chance.
hey, how did we do?
that is great and we still have most of our stuff.
good.
no, no, no, no, let us not talk about that.
shhhh.
let us go on a little walk.
you know what?
i want to show you some stuff.
so this is one of my favorite places in the world.
this is where toby announced that he was going to costa rica.
happiest day of my life.
until the day you came to replace him.
let us go in here.
this is where we first kissed.
and this is where we first made love.
remember what i tried there?
through these blinds is where i first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and i thought you were the prettiest mover i had ever seen.
and i was sitting at this desk when i called you to tell you that i had herpes and that i was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you did not love me.
thank goodness none of that was true.
including the herpes.
in-grown hair.
right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting.
remember, obesity awareness?
we saved a lot of lives that day.
that is where you first met michael klump.
and right over there is where you found out that meredith was prostituting herself for outback steak.
and i will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you could not believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
and over here.. well, nothing.
nothing really.
i would just find an excuse to come here so i could stare at you through that window.
this is what I would do.
let us go in here.
this is where our love faces its toughest test.
after this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
that guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
that marriage would be a sham.
easy no.
that would be hot.
i would pay to see that.
only one that i was kind of worried about.
this is where i fell in love with you.
and this is where i ask you to marry me.
it started with..  holly flax, marrying me will you be?
thank you.
so guys, guys, guys.
we are moving to colorado.
yep.
holly has to go back to colorado.
I am going with her.
I am leaving.
kahlua sombrero, please.
actually, i am meeting somebody, but I am a little bit early.
leaving my company.
after 19 years.
oh, really?
and to middles, the unsung heroes.
and to moms.
do not tell my fiance I am drinking on a wednesday.
I am moving out to the burbs... actually, I am moving further than the burbs, I am moving to colorado.
yep.
do not mess with colorado.
no, no.
i do not want to end up like sunny bobo.
you know, i would like to try the luge, through.
that is what I have heard.
oh yeah?
me too.
summer or winter?
really?
what happened?
oh... wow.
the mountains.
where things are.
man, he is late.
I am going to call him.
do you mind?
I am sorry.
no, I am here.
I am right... I am at the bar.
you are?
what bar?
i... do not see you.
I am been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
what are you wearing?
are we both at the right place?
i hear your voice.
i see your voice in the phone.
oh, man!
michael scott.
wow... that is insane!
here we go!
are you ready?
alright!
here we go!
this is it.
what do you think?
ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it is own sake.
so, without further ado, let us start clapping!
presenting deangelo vickers!
come on out!
i am well, sir, how are you?
and we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it is deangelo the whole time!
i happen to like the hilarious hijinx i get myself into.
there he is!
deangelo, i was just telling them about last night, when we met.
remember that?
that was crazy!
oh yeah... i know... that is what i was just saying... that is what... this is jim and pam, aka jap.
what started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
yes it was.
are you kidding?
I would come anywhere to see a turtle?
where did you find him.
you know me very well, dwight.
now I am going to have to go online and look at turtles or I will be off all day.
so you decided to have an orgy and not invite me?
i call the middle!
i sorta like the old way.
i know, i know, I am sorry, but if it is not a big deal we should just- is that good?
well, whatever.
whatever you think will work.
you can do the old way or whatever you think would work.
shave me.
this is going to be funny!
looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
and this is erin and she is going to shave my face.
here we go.
it really does.
this is luxery.
here we go.
ah, that is nice.
well, we do not really do rap sessions.
we kind of do...  god... we sorta do more of like powwows or- that is- you know what, everybody?
you have to be honest, here.
you can not say that everything is perfect.
so, you know, come up with something.
ok, you know what, i mark it urgent a, urgent b, urgent c, urgent d. urgent a is the most important, urgent d you do not even really have to worry about.
do not shave my lips.
you know, this office sort of has a perfect feng shui to it, so... you know, let us not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I am still here- i still have to look at this stuff, guys.
deangelo's great.
i love the guy.
but I am not sure he is a great fit for the office.
and also, I am not sure if i love the guy.
snack time!
it is the witching hour!
it is the sandwitching hour!
pb and j, my mom's recipe!
i think kevin wants one.
kevin, here you go!
what?
oscar, here you go.
no one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
no, that is good.
you just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser.
no body go in.
no body go in there.
stay where you are.
no, it is not insane, oscar.
I am been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you are going to throw it all away?
no.
well, who needs him.
guess it is just you and me, dwight.
i start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes.
and you might want to develop a couple of characters.
you know what, you will be fine.
ok.  why did you have to be so damn good?
no, no, no.
come on.
you are good, they know it.
you will figure it out.
it is six a.m.  and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their dundie nomination certificates.
just like the oscars!
every year!
this happens, you have a lot to learn my friend.
why do you always say that?
you are going to love it.
alright let us go!
this way, this way!
surprise!
you and pam have both been nominated for dundie awards!
here we go!
have pam come down.
congratulations!
we got it.
yeah that is fine.
hey toby!
you suck!
go go go go go go!
I have never seen this place in the daylight.
here we go, alright got it?
set?
hello?
yes you did.
that is right!
congratulations meredith.
we should head out.
go.
good morning erin.
you have big plans for tonight?
you are getting so funny!
very good.
the dundies are my baby, and they need to go on.
when larry king died they did not just cancel his show.
they got pierce morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, larry lives on.
anything can happen at the dundies!
they are like the golden globes but less mean.
and i just want all of us to have a good time!
black tie optional.
a la, tonight we will be hosting at louie volpies!
shh, shh!
okay, okay.
everybody's right.
they are like breadsticks on steroids.
right?
so as you know, the dundies are my legacy.
so I am going to need to train a replacement.
so this year, i have decided to have a co-host.
and that person is  deangelo!
think of it as part of your training.
okay, well we will work on it.
you are doing it.
guys!
i want you to help us work on some banter.
here we go!
so, deangelo!
you and i have a lot in common.
you lost two hundred pounds, and i lose my car keys every morning.
okay, okay.
you know what, i did not actually lose my keys... mmmmkay.
there needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat.
and right now it is all rat and no tat.
ryan come on up here.
tap deangelo out.
just watch this.
okay.
ryan how are you today?
there you go!
lovely!
regis and kelly!
nice!
use that as an inspiration.
just be funny.
no!
god!
no, no, no!
this is the performance of your life!
jim, please no loopholes.
this is my last dundies ever, if i want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
good.
good.
good!
now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
too personal.
i do not want to hear about it.
let us try this.
put these on.
i am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up.
so you can not-  that is right, you are not going to be able to hear yourself.
read this,  and make it sound perfect.
say it with an accent!
the dundies!
I am here.
in a good way!
I have been here the whole time.
deangelo, what are you doing?
there is a live audience out there!
no, ryan would never do it.
it is too on the radar.
look, look.
the boss, hosts, the dundies!
it is sort of our perk!
listen to me, you are not doing this for me, you are not doing this for you, you are not even doing this for them!
you are doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the louie volpies kid's menu, wondering: does it get better?
what i want you to do, is i want you to say: it is showtime.
get out there.
say it.
you can do it, just say it.
now hit me.
one, two, three.
alright, here we go.
okay!
okay!
sorry about the delay everybody!
but we were at the dmv waiting in line.
there are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad.
and a close personal friend of mine, jim halpert!
best dad dundie!
well done.
which moves us to, best mom dundie.
i guess we all kind of consider her a mom around the office.
meredith palmer!
year after year, i catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year i present this award to a guy instead of a girl.
hottest in the office goes to,  danny cordray!
danny could not be here tonight... stanley hudson is a grump, everybody knows that.
but did you know, that stanley hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes.
the diabetes award goes to stanley hudson!
come on up here you sick bastard.
you know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults?
pippy longstocking, ronald mcdonald's wife, ron howard, ron weasley, what do thay all have in common?
red heads.
erin hannon, come on up here and receive your cutest red head in the office award!
there you go.
it is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you.
but he is a good guy, so the michael scott award for best dundies host goes to deangelo vickers.
deangelo is expressing himself.
[manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here deangelo.
okay, we are done!
that is it.
we are done.
we are done!
so that is how it ends.
my last dundies ever.
i was hoping it would be more like godfather three.
that rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way.
but instead it is like godfather one!
that was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs.
oh well... what?
no, no.
you are being too hard on yourself.
we had a very truncated rehearsal time.
so what you are saying is you kind of like it?
I have fallen and i can not get up!
that phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
that got a big laugh.
you were laughing right?
we are really close.
that is true, we would not get seats together.
you know, despite a couple hiccups, i think that went very well.
man!
maybe you should have won the kind of a bitch award.
what is your problem?!
okay!
that, that is unfair!
the clothing was safe, but tasteful.
he is in an all-out sprint.
here...  okay!
by his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the doobie doobie pothead stoner of the year award goes to, andy bernard!
oh, okay.
oh my god, something is happening.
yeah, okay.
well this is going to hurt like a mother.
no it is not.
here he comes!
alright!
you deserve it!
well, I am moving to colorado to start my new life with holly.
just up here, getting used to the altitude.
yes?
ahh, thank you.
like a butler.
oh, these do not taste like oysters.
sick freak!
what is wrong with you?
i do not own dunder mifflin, okay?
the job was not mine to give.
look, i need your advice on something.
i am told that there are bears in the rockies.
well, i was just thinking that maybe i should keep a salami in my pocket... ...in order to feed the bears.
how do you mean?
okay, so no salami in the pants.
how about a pepperoni?
okay.
hm?
well i have interviews.
yes.
yes, you know what?
take my favorite truck.
sure.
oh you do not, that is- that sounds good.
thank you.
sad?
no, no, no.
i do not leave 'til tomorrow, so... tomorrow i will be a wreck.
there they are!
party planning committee together again!
mmm!
you know what, I am thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like.
how about vanilla?
let us get vanilla.
tomorrow i want everyone to have a good time.
no drama.
and as for today, just a typical day.
alright?
what do you like pam?
what kind of toppings would you like?
sounds good.
fudge it up!
i bought this for myself.
and yesterday, they gave me this.
i still need something to drink out of though.
attention everyone, before i leave tomorrow i would like to reveal a secret i have kept for over twenty years.
a secret about phyllis.
when phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute.
and she still is.
ahh.
sounds great, i just think it is great.
oh, i have gifts as well!
and i will start, by giving the first gift to phyllis!
phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you do not often speak your mind, but you should.
because you have great ideas.
so phyllis, i am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind.
stanley, you love your sudoku and your puzzles, i bestow upon you, my felt.
may you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
well, okay... and andy, andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman.
i give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts.
but you are the best salesman, on the inside.
you sold us all on andy, a product that nobody wanted.
you are not going to lose them.
just do your best!
i have faith in you.
kevin, i have something for you.
you know who that is?
do not be a caricature kevin, never be a caricature.
how did that feel when i tore that up?
good, stand up.
you will be thin.
you will not drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
you will find love.
do not be.
you should never settle for who you are.
oscar, oscar, oscar!
oscar, you are- okay, you know what?
just do your best buddy!
okay, oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education.
and, i think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain.
so that is why i made you this.
it looks like a  it looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm!
he just accepted, accepted that i put all this work into it!
he has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
how would you have wanted to do it?
okay, okay.
you know what?
inappropriate.
i am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a senator.
mmhmm, bravo!
sure!
who is that?
who is that guy?
i guess this could be the one, huh?
my last pay check?
no.
I am not sure, um, mountainton?
nah, I am almost done.
yeah.
i can not do this.
all the channels are going to be different there.
I am not going to be able to find my shows.
I am not going to start improv at level one, and i do not think my credits will transfer.
ugh, and you know what?
i just figured out where i was supposed to go to vote.
i got to call her, and I am going to tell her, that i cannot come.
hi.
what is the name of our town?
no, no.
i just needed to hear your voice.
yes.
yes my hero!
ohh, i miss you.
okay.
I will see you tonight.
i love you.
yes, so i know i told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I am, I am going to be leaving tonight.
i head to the airport at four.
and i have said goodbye to half of them.
okay.
kelly!
kelly?
kelly.
if i just went away right now, would that be the best gift that i could give you?
she was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
yeah.
you are not prone to seizures?
um, pam.
okay... darryl!
i would like to give you, the only copy, of somehow i manage.
unfinished.
if there is anyone here who can finish it, it is you.
mmmhmmm.
it is true.
darryl, i have one last wish.
i would like to use the bailer.
no problem.
worth a try.
darryl said i could use the bailer because I am leaving.
alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse.

catch you guys-  catch you guys on the filippity flip.
flippity flip!
flippity flip!
really?
okay, see ya guys!
kevin?
ahhhh... maybe neither.
erin, listen to me.
you should not rush into this.
at all.
and you know why?
because you are beautiful.
and you are fun.
and you are smart.
and when the right guy comes along, you will know it.
you will.
and you know what?
you do not need a mom.
because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
n- okay.
phyllis.
phyllis, are my mittens done?
listen to me.
it is two p.m. from now until four, your priority is knitting.
knit like the wind.
dwight, i will be leaving tomorrow.
so i wanted to give you that.
it is a letter of recommendation.
you should see the other guy.
jim where is pam?
